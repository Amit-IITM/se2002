<?summary-of-invention description="Summary of Invention" end="lead"?>
<heading id="h-0001" level="1">FIELD</heading>
<p id="p-0002" num="0001">Some implementations relate generally to disposable toilet seat covers, and, more particularly, to a disposable toilet seat cover constructed to slip over a toilet seat, a dispenser for the disposable toilet seat cover, and a toilet seat and toilet seat accessory for use with the disposable toilet seat cover disclosed herein.</p>
<heading id="h-0002" level="1">BACKGROUND</heading>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">Some conventional disposable toilet seat covers may be cumbersome or difficult to retrieve from a dispenser and to use on a toilet. Some conventional disposable toilet seat covers include a single layer of tissue-like paper that is design to lay on top of the toilet seat. These conventional covers are prone to slipping off the toilet seat before a user can use the toilet. Also, the conventional disposable toilet seat covers may not fully cover the toilet seat, leaving the toilet seat partially exposed and subject to skin contact by a user when using the toilet with the conventional toilet seat cover.</p>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">Embodiments were conceived in light of the above-mentioned problems and limitations, among other things. The background description provided herein is for the purpose of generally presenting the context of the disclosure. Work of the presently named inventor(s), to the extent it is described in this background section, as well as aspects of the description that may not otherwise qualify as prior art at the time of filing, are neither expressly nor impliedly admitted as prior art against the present disclosure.</p>

<heading id="h-0004" level="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION</heading>
<p id="p-0014" num="0013"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref> is a diagram showing a top view of an example disposable toilet seat cover <b>100</b> being slipped over a toilet seat <b>108</b> in accordance with some implementations. The disposable toilet seat cover <b>100</b> includes a dual-layer pocket portion <b>102</b>, a tab <b>104</b>, and an opening <b>106</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0015" num="0014">The dual-layer pocket portion can include a first material layer and a second material layer that are sealed together (e.g., on the three sides other than the side with the tab <b>104</b>) to form a pocket that can slip over a toilet seat. The pocket portion <b>102</b> can have an opening formed by unsealed edges at the side where tab <b>104</b> is located. The opening <b>106</b> is configured to align with the opening of a toilet seat <b>108</b> and permit the toilet to be used.</p>
<p id="p-0016" num="0015"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref> is a diagram showing a top view of an example disposable toilet seat cover pocket portion <b>102</b> slipped over a toilet seat <b>108</b> and in place for use in accordance with some implementations. In operation, a user can use the tab <b>104</b> to pull the pocket portion <b>102</b> over the toilet seat <b>108</b>.</p>

This gap <b>306</b> permits the pocket portion <b>102</b> to be slipped over the toilet seat <b>108</b>.</p>

<p id="p-0022" num="0021"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>7</b></figref> is a diagram showing a side view of an example toilet seat <b>108</b> having a flexible accessory member <b>702</b> configured to space the toilet seat <b>108</b> apart from the toilet bowl <b>302</b> in accordance with some implementations. The hinge <b>704</b> in this version can be a standard hinge, where the spacing between the toilet seat <b>108</b> and the toilet bowl <b>302</b> is provided by the flexible or compressible accessory <b>702</b>.</p>
