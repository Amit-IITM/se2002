<p id="p-0002" num="0001">The present invention relates to the technical field of pet feeders, and in particular, to a vacuum fresh-keeping feeder with a replaceable food bucket.</p>
<heading id="h-0002" level="1">BACKGROUND OF THE DISCLOSURE</heading>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">With the continuous improvement of residents' living standards, a growing number of domestic urban residents keep pets. Pets have become indispensable good companions for many old people, children and even workers, and also become people's spiritual ballast to relax. However, in real life, since no special person takes care of or feeds pets in most of families, pet owners' going out early and coming home late makes pets have to eat in a hurry only in the morning and in the evening but have nothing to eat when they are hungry at home. It is convenient to buy pets, but raising pets is not an easy task. Especially when people go out for business or tourism, they usually cannot take timely and good care of pets at home, so feeding pets has become an outstanding problem that puzzles people. Therefore, automatic pet feeders have emerged.</p>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">Existing pet feeders can only keep the pet food fresh by using a desiccant or a seal ring in use. No effective solutions have been put forward yet by far against the problem of how to implement vacuumizing and dehumidifying and freshness keeping of the pet feeders in related technologies.</p>
<heading id="h-0003" level="1">SUMMARY OF THE DISCLOSURE</heading>

An end of the cover body <b>51</b> is hinged to the accommodating bucket <b>4</b> to improve sealing performance of the accommodating bucket <b>4</b>. In other embodiments, the accommodating bucket <b>4</b> and the discharge assembly <b>2</b> are assembled in a threaded manner. The accommodating bucket <b>4</b> and the upper cover <b>5</b> are assembled in a threaded manner. A handle is disposed on an outer wall of the accommodating bucket <b>4</b>. The connector <b>3</b> is two magnets.</p>
<p id="p-0029" num="0028">Preferably, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref> and <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref>, the discharge assembly <b>2</b> includes: a food guide base <b>21</b> and a discharge member.</p>
<p id="p-0030" num="0029">The food guide base <b>21</b> is disposed at the bottom of the accommodating bucket <b>4</b>. A discharge frame <b>211</b> communicating with the accommodating bucket <b>4</b> is disposed on the food guide base <b>21</b>. The discharge member is disposed in the food guide base <b>21</b>. The discharge member is configured to control food in the accommodating bucket <b>4</b> to fall or stop falling. In this embodiment, the food guide base <b>21</b> and the accommodating bucket <b>4</b> are detachably assembled, so that this apparatus is convenient to detach, clean, and replace. A base is disposed at the bottom of the food guide base <b>21</b>. The base <b>11</b> is configured to support the entire apparatus. A food guide plate <b>22</b> is disposed on a side face of the food guide base <b>21</b>. The food guide plate <b>22</b> is inclined, with a higher end disposed below a discharge position of the discharge assembly <b>2</b>. A food dish <b>1</b> is disposed on the food guide base <b>21</b> in an oblique direction, and the food dish <b>1</b> is concave inward and configured to accommodate the pet food. A lower end of the food guide plate <b>22</b> faces toward the food dish <b>1</b>. The pet food slides into the food dish <b>1</b> by using the food guide base <b>21</b> and is prevented from easily falling out of the food dish <b>1</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0031" num="0030">Preferably, the discharge member includes: a partition plate <b>233</b>, a motor <b>231</b>, and a rotation plate <b>235</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0032" num="0031">The partition plate <b>233</b> is fixedly disposed in the discharge frame <b>211</b>. The partition plate <b>233</b> is fixedly disposed in the food guide base <b>21</b>. A first food leaking hole <b>234</b> and a through-hole are provided in the partition plate <b>233</b> and fixedly provided at the bottom of the partition plate <b>233</b>. An output shaft of the motor <b>231</b> penetrates through the through-hole. one side of the rotation plate <b>235</b> is fixedly disposed at an end of the discharge frame <b>211</b> away from the accommodating bucket <b>4</b>, and the other side of the rotation plate <b>235</b> is closely attached to the partition plate <b>233</b>. The rotation plate <b>235</b> is connected to the output shaft of the motor <b>231</b>. A second food leaking hole <b>237</b> that corresponds to the first food leaking hole <b>234</b> is provided in the rotation plate <b>235</b>. An annular groove is provided in an outer edge of the partition plate <b>233</b>. The rotation plate <b>235</b> is rotationally disposed in the annular groove. A diameter of the rotation plate <b>235</b> is greater than or equal to a diameter of the discharge frame <b>211</b> and less than a diameter of the annular groove. When the diameter of the rotation plate <b>235</b> is greater than the diameter of the discharge frame <b>211</b> and less than the diameter of the annular groove and the motor <b>231</b> rotates, the output shaft drives the rotation plate <b>235</b> to rotate in the annular groove. When the second food leaking hole <b>237</b> of the rotation plate <b>235</b> overlaps the first food leaking hole <b>234</b> of the partition plate <b>233</b>, the pet food falls out of the accommodating bucket <b>4</b>. When the motor <b>231</b> continues to rotate, the second food leaking hole <b>237</b> and the first food leaking hole <b>234</b> are staggered, so that the pet food stops falling. In this embodiment, a mounting sleeve <b>236</b> is provided on the rotation plate <b>235</b>, and the output shaft of the motor <b>231</b> and the mounting sleeve <b>236</b> on the rotation plate <b>235</b> are assembled in a clamped manner, so that the motor <b>231</b> and the rotation plate <b>235</b> are convenient to detach. A fastening rod <b>232</b> for fastening the motor <b>231</b> is disposed at the bottom of the partition plate <b>233</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0033" num="0032">The working principle of the present invention is generally described as follows. The discharge assembly <b>2</b> is connected to the accommodating bucket <b>4</b>. When the discharge assembly <b>2</b> works, the discharge assembly <b>2</b> discharges the pet food in the accommodating bucket <b>4</b> out of the accommodating bucket <b>4</b>. When the discharge assembly <b>2</b> stops working, the accommodating bucket <b>4</b> is kept in a sealed state. The vacuum apparatus <b>55</b> is disposed on the accommodating bucket <b>4</b>, and the vacuum apparatus <b>55</b> is configured to draw air in the accommodating bucket <b>4</b> when the discharge assembly <b>2</b> stops working, so that the accommodating bucket <b>4</b> keeps a nearly vacuum state inside, and a fresh-keeping and dehumidifying capacity of the accommodating bucket <b>4</b> is improved. The connector <b>3</b> is disposed between the discharge assembly <b>2</b> and the accommodating bucket <b>4</b>, so that the discharge assembly <b>2</b> and the accommodating bucket <b>4</b> are detachably assembled. With such an arrangement, the vacuum fresh-keeping feeder with a replaceable food bucket effectively resolves the defects that an existing pet feeder can only keep the pet food fresh by using a desiccant or a seal ring <b>54</b> in use, so that a fresh-keeping effect is poor, and it is troublesome to keep freshness.
