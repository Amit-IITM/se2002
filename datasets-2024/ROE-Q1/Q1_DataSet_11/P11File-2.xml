<abstract id="abstract">
<p id="p-0001" num="0000">An emitter outlet defining an ingress channel having a first volume and area, and having a first portion that is substantially perpendicular to a second portion located downstream of the first portion which causes fluid flowing through the ingress channel to make a first fluid velocity reducing turn, and a first opening located off of the second portion that causes at least a portion of the fluid flowing through the ingress channel to make a second fluid velocity reducing turn, and an outlet bath with a second volume and area that is larger than the first volume and area of the ingress channel so as to cause further pressure and/or velocity reduction of the fluid entering into the outlet bath. In addition, emitters, drip lines and various methods relating to such an emitter outlet configuration are also disclosed.</p>

<heading id="h-0002" level="1">FIELD</heading>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">The present invention relates to irrigation drip emitters, and more particularly, to outlets for same, to drip lines made with such emitters and emitter outlets and methods relating to same.</p>
<heading id="h-0003" level="1">BACKGROUND</heading>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">Drip emitters are commonly used in irrigation systems to convert water flowing through a supply tube at a relatively high flow rate to a relatively low flow rate at the outlet of each emitter. Each drip emitter generally includes a housing defining a flow path that reduces high pressure water entering the drip emitter into relatively low pressure water exiting the drip emitter. Multiple drip emitters are commonly mounted on the inside or outside of a water supply tube. In one type of system, a large number of drip emitters are mounted at regular and predetermined intervals along the length of the supply tube to distribute water at precise points to surrounding land and vegetation. These emitters may either be mounted internally (i.e., in-line emitters) or externally (i.e., on-line or branch emitters). Some advantages to in-line emitters are that the emitter units are less susceptible to being knocked loose from the fluid carrying conduit and the conduit can be buried underground if desired (i.e., subsurface emitters) which further makes it difficult for the emitter to be inadvertently damaged (e.g., by way of being hit or kicked by a person, hit by a lawnmower or trimmer, etc.).</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">In addition to the advantages of in-line emitters, subsurface drip emitters provide numerous advantages over drip emitters located and installed above ground. First, they limit water loss due to runoff and evaporation and thereby provide significant savings in water consumption. Water may also be used more economically by directing it at precise locations of the root systems of plants or other desired subsurface locations.</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">Second, subsurface drip emitters provide convenience. They allow the user to irrigate the surrounding terrain at any time of day or night without restriction. For example, such emitters may be used to water park or school grounds at any desired time. Drip emitters located above ground, on the other hand, may be undesirable at parks and school grounds during daytime hours when children or other individuals are present.</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">Third, subsurface emitters are not easily vandalized, given their installation in a relatively inaccessible location, i.e., underground. Thus, use of such subsurface emitters results in reduced costs associated with replacing vandalized equipment and with monitoring for the occurrence of such vandalism. For instance, use of subsurface emitters may lessen the costs associated with maintenance of publicly accessible areas, such as parks, school grounds, and landscaping around commercial buildings and parking lots.</p>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">Fourth, the use of subsurface drip emitters can prevent the distribution of water to undesired terrain, such as roadways and walkways. More specifically, the use of subsurface drip emitters prevents undesirable &#x201c;overspray.&#x201d; In contrast, above-ground emitters often generate overspray that disturbs vehicles and/or pedestrians. The above-identified advantages are only illustrative; other advantages exist in connection with the use of subsurface drip emitters.</p>
<p id="p-0009" num="0008">Although some advantages of subsurface emitters are described above, it would be desirable to provide an improved in-line drip emitter design and even an on-line drip emitter design that can be used in both subsurface and above ground applications. For both applications, there is a need to provide for a relatively constant water output from each of the emitters in the irrigation system. More specifically, it is desirable to provide an emitter outlet (or outlet bath) and emitters and dripline with such outlets that reduce the velocity of the fluid at the outlet to help ensure the emitter provides relatively constant fluid pattern from each of the emitters and the drip line as a whole. In some instances, such as when an outlet opening in the dripline is not perfectly located in relation to the emitter outlet or when the floor of the emitter outlet deflects up under pressure in just the right way, the emitter can cause squirting of fluid from the emitter which does not result in the relatively constant fluid pattern that is desired for an emitter.</p>
<p id="p-0010" num="0009">There is also a need in the irrigation industry to provide drip emitters that have a generally unobstructed outlet (or outlet bath) so that outlet openings may be formed in the drip line more easily (e.g., without requiring exacting specificity as to the location of the outlet opening formed in the drip line with respect to the emitter outlet bath, or requiring very tight/narrow tolerances as to the outlet opening's positioning or location with respect to (or relative to) the emitter outlet bath). In order to keep drip line production running at a desired pace, it is important to provide some tolerance as to the location of the outlet opening with respect to the emitter while still maintaining proper emitter performance. A need also exists for better emitter designs that help prevent clogging and improve flushing of grit so that desired flow rates can be achieved and maintained.</p>
<p id="p-0011" num="0010">It is also desirable to provide a drip emitter that minimizes parts and assembly as this will not only make the component less complicated to construct and likely save on material costs, but will also reduce the number of emitters that do not perform as desired due to misaligned parts, missing parts, etc. Drip emitters are commonly formed of multi-piece components (e.g., two or more-piece housing structures or assemblies with separate flexible diaphragms, etc.) that require individual manufacture of the various parts of the emitter and then assembly of the parts prior to mounting to the supply tube. Even slight misalignment of these components during assembly may result in a malfunctioning drip emitter. Thus, in addition to the above needs, it would be desirable to reduce the number of components required to make the emitter and the manufacturing steps and time it takes to create a finished product.</p>
<p id="p-0012" num="0011">Accordingly, it has been determined that the need exists for improved emitter outlets (or outlet baths), an improved emitter with such an outlet, improved dripline with such emitters, and methods relating to same which overcomes the aforementioned limitations and which further provides capabilities, features and functions, not available in current designs and methods, and for an improved method for doing the same.</p>

<heading id="h-0005" level="1">DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS</heading>
<p id="p-0059" num="0058">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>1</b>A-F</figref>, a drip irrigation emitter <b>10</b> is provided for distributing water from a fluid supply source or conduit, such as drip line or tube <b>70</b>, at a low flow rate. The drip line <b>70</b> carries pressurized fluid throughout an irrigation system and preferably includes numerous emitters <b>10</b> spaced apart at predetermined intervals in the dip line <b>70</b> in order to allow the drip line <b>70</b> to be placed above or below ground to water and/or treat grass, plants, shrubs, trees or other landscaping, or to water agricultural crops of various kinds. In the form illustrated, the emitter <b>10</b> includes an integral body <b>20</b> which defines an inlet <b>30</b> connectible to a source of pressurized fluid, an outlet <b>40</b> for discharging the fluid from the emitter body <b>20</b>, and a pressure reducing flow channel or passage <b>50</b> between the inlet <b>30</b> and outlet area <b>40</b> for reducing the flow of fluid discharged through the outlet <b>16</b>. In addition, the emitter body <b>20</b> defines a pressure compensating member <b>60</b> for reducing a cross-section of the flow channel in response to an increase in pressure of the pressurized supply line fluid.</p>
<p id="p-0060" num="0059">In the form illustrated, the emitter body <b>20</b> is made of an elastomeric material, such as a thermoplastic or thermosetting elastomeric material like materials that use ethylene, propylene, styrene, PVC, nitrile, natural rubber, silicone, etc., to form a polymer or copolymer. In a preferred form, the elastomeric material is made of thermoplastic polyolefin (TPO) and silicone rubber. This combination helps create an emitter and drip line that is capable of withstanding the high temperatures and harsh chemicals the emitter may be subjected to while in use. In addition, the emitter is made of a singular or unitary construction rather than having a multi-part construction and/or requiring the assembly of housing parts, diaphragms, etc. This simple construction makes it easier to manufacture the emitter and makes the emitter more grit-tolerant. More particularly, the simple and flexible construction of the emitter can easily process grit or other particulates by expanding to process the grit (aka burping) due to the fact there are no additional housing portions to prevent such expansion. This simple construction also allows the emitter to be flushed more easily by allowing line pressure to be increased to process grit out of the emitter without concern for damaging the emitter because there are no additional pieces, such as multi-part housings, that limit the amount of movement the emitter can make before breaking or coming apart.</p>
<p id="p-0061" num="0060">Whereas in conventional emitters, even those having two-piece housings, diaphragms and metering grooves to assist in the flushing of grit, the emitter typically reaches a state where further increases is pressure will not increase processing of grit. For example, in conventional emitters, at a certain point of fluid pressure, the pressure on both sides of the diaphragm will eventually become equal and the emitter will cease processing or burping the grit. In the form illustrated, however, the disclosed emitter will continue to process grit with increases in pressure well beyond when conventional emitters stop processing grit (e.g., when this state of equal pressures on opposite sides of the diaphragm are reached). Thus, line pressure can simply continue to be increased in order to drive grit through the emitter body. The elastomeric nature of the emitter body <b>20</b> further helps flushing or burping particulates or grit even when simply turning on and off the supply line.</p>
<p id="p-0062" num="0061">As best illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>1</b>E-F</figref>, the body <b>20</b> defines a plurality of slots <b>21</b>, <b>22</b>, <b>23</b> and <b>24</b>, extending longitudinally along the bottom surface of the emitter body <b>20</b> which are separated by protrusions, such as guide ribs <b>25</b>, <b>26</b>, <b>27</b>, <b>28</b> and <b>29</b>. The outer most guide ribs <b>25</b> and <b>29</b> are positioned on the periphery of the bottom surface of emitter body <b>20</b> while the inner most ribs <b>26</b>-<b>28</b> are positioned on an interior portion separated from the periphery by inlet channel <b>31</b>. In a preferred form, the inlet channel <b>31</b> is sized to deflect foreign materials from obstructing the inlet <b>30</b> or entering the emitter body <b>20</b> and guide ribs <b>25</b>-<b>29</b> have at least one tapered end and run parallel to the longitudinal axis of the emitter body <b>20</b> to further help deflect foreign materials from obstructing the inlet channel <b>31</b> or entering the emitter body <b>20</b>. In the form illustrated, the inlet channel <b>31</b> extends continuously around or at a perimeter region of the emitter body <b>20</b> and empties into the inlet <b>30</b>. More particularly, in the form illustrated, the inlet channel <b>31</b> is a generally oval shaped raceway recessed in the bottom surface of the emitter body <b>20</b> having curved ends <b>31</b><i>a</i>, <b>31</b><i>b </i>and longer straight-aways <b>31</b><i>c</i>, <b>31</b><i>d </i>that run longitudinally along the bottom of body <b>20</b>. The inlet channel has a generally rectangular cross-section and opens into the inlet <b>30</b> via a rectangular shaped opening.</p>
<p id="p-0063" num="0062">The recessed nature and length of inlet channel <b>31</b> helps prevent grit or other particulates from entering into the inlet <b>30</b> that could clog the emitter <b>10</b> or form obstructions preventing the emitter <b>10</b> from operating in the desired manner. More particularly, once installed in the drip line <b>70</b>, pressurized fluid flows along the bottom side of the emitter body <b>20</b> with some fluid entering into the raceway of inlet channel <b>31</b> and traveling about the periphery of the emitter body <b>20</b> and then, ultimately, into the inlet opening <b>30</b>. In this manner, the side walls of channel <b>31</b> serve to deflect grit and other particulates in the fluid from entering into the inlet channel <b>31</b> and into the inlet opening <b>30</b>. This prevents the emitter <b>10</b> from getting clogged and/or having obstructions enter the emitter <b>10</b> that might otherwise negatively affect or compromise the desired operation of the emitter. The circular flow that is created by the inlet channel <b>31</b> further helps ensure that larger particulates that might fit within the inlet channel <b>31</b> will fall out of or be flushed from the channel <b>31</b> as the fluid races about the raceway before the fluid enters into the inlet opening <b>30</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0064" num="0063">The guide ribs <b>25</b>-<b>29</b> serve the dual function of assisting with the mounting of the emitter body <b>20</b> into the irrigation drip line and further help deflect grit or particulates in the pressurized fluid away from the inlet channel <b>31</b> and inlet opening <b>30</b>. More particularly, one or more of the guide ribs <b>25</b>-<b>29</b> may be used by an insertion tool to align and insert the emitter body <b>20</b> into the drip line <b>70</b> as the drip line is being extruded. In a preferred form, this is done as the drip line <b>70</b> is being extruded so that the upper surfaces of the emitter body <b>20</b> are bonded or welded to the drip line <b>70</b> while the drip line is hot and before it begins to cool. The guide ribs <b>25</b>-<b>29</b> may also be tapered or pointed to assist in the initial loading of the emitter body <b>20</b> from a bowl sorter and into the inserter or loader used to insert the emitter body <b>20</b> into the freshly extruded drip line <b>70</b>. Such tapering further assists with getting fluid in the supply line to flow between the narrow passages defined by the ribs <b>25</b>-<b>29</b> without causing too much disturbance or adding too much turbulence to the fluid flowing through the supply line <b>70</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0065" num="0064">In the form illustrated, the guide ribs <b>25</b>-<b>29</b> also help prevent grit or other particulates in the pressurized fluid from entering into the inlet channel <b>31</b> and inlet opening <b>30</b>. More particularly, like the sidewalls of inlet channel <b>31</b>, the ribs <b>25</b>-<b>29</b> create narrowed passageways which help deflect larger particulates away from the inlet channel <b>31</b> and inlet opening <b>30</b>. Thus, the ribs <b>25</b>-<b>29</b> deflect away larger particulates from the inlet channel <b>31</b> and inlet opening <b>30</b> and the sidewalls of inlet channel <b>31</b> deflect away smaller particulates that are capable of fitting into the narrowed passageways defined by the ribs <b>25</b>-<b>29</b>. This prevents the emitter <b>10</b> from getting clogged and/or having obstructions enter the emitter <b>10</b> that might otherwise negatively affect or compromise the desired operation of the emitter <b>10</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0066" num="0065">In the form illustrated, the inlet opening <b>30</b> is generally rectangular in shape and of a desired size to ensure that the emitter <b>10</b> receives a desired amount of fluid at a desired fluid flow rate in order to operate as desired. In alternate forms, however, the inlet opening <b>30</b> may be designed in a variety of different shapes and sizes to accommodate specific desires or applications. For example, in alternate forms, the inlet opening may be designed as more of an elongated slot or slit, or plurality of slot-like openings as illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b></figref> (which will be discussed further below), for receiving fluid but further deflecting grit or particulates that are small enough to pass through the walls of inlet channel <b>31</b> or it may be designed to cooperate with the pressure-reduction flow channel <b>50</b> to start reducing the flow and pressure of the fluid as it enters the emitter body <b>20</b> (e.g., the inlet may form a tortuous passage that leads to the pressure-reduction channel <b>50</b>). Similarly, the inlet channel <b>31</b> may be designed in a variety of different shapes and sizes. For example, instead of a generally oval shape, the inlet channel <b>31</b> may be designed to be a smaller slot that extends over a small portion of emitter body <b>20</b> instead of traveling about a periphery of the bottom of the emitter body <b>20</b>, or may be designed with a zigzag pattern to form a tortuous path to further assist in reducing pressure of the fluid passing through the emitter body <b>20</b> (similar to that of the flow path <b>50</b>, which will now be discussed in further detail).</p>
<p id="p-0067" num="0066">With respect to the fluid that makes it through the passageways defined by ribs <b>25</b>-<b>29</b> and into the inlet channel <b>31</b>, this fluid passes through the inlet opening <b>30</b> and enters a pressure-reducing flow channel <b>50</b> that produces a significant reduction in pressure between the fluid flowing in the primary lumen of the supply conduit or drip line <b>70</b> and the fluid ultimately emptying into and present in the emitter outlet area <b>40</b>. In the form illustrated, the emitter body <b>20</b> defines opposed baffle walls to create the pressure-reducing flow channel and, in a preferred form, has an inner baffle wall <b>51</b> that is surrounded by an outer baffle wall <b>52</b> which extends about the inner baffle wall <b>51</b> in a generally U-shaped manner to form a flow passageway that generally directs the water in a U-shaped direction of travel. More particularly, the inner and outer baffle walls <b>51</b>, <b>52</b> have alternating projections and recesses that form a tortuous passage and cause the fluid flowing therethrough to zigzag back and forth, reducing pressure with each turn the fluid makes. The outer baffle wall <b>52</b> is defined by an outer rim or peripheral wall of the emitter body <b>20</b> and the inner baffle wall <b>51</b> extends from a portion of the outer rim or peripheral wall and into to the middle of the emitter body <b>20</b> to form a peninsula about which the fluid flows from inlet <b>30</b> to outlet <b>40</b>. The upper surfaces of the emitter body preferably have a radius of curvature that tracks the radius of curvature of the tube <b>70</b> so that the emitter body <b>20</b> can be bonded securely to the inner wall of the tube <b>70</b> and create an enclosed pressure reduction passage from inlet <b>30</b> to outlet <b>40</b>. In the form illustrated, the tortuous passage is formed via alternating teeth extending from opposing surfaces of the inner and outer baffle walls <b>51</b>, <b>52</b> and has a cross-section that is generally rectangular in shape when the emitter body <b>20</b> is bonded to the inner surface of the extruded drip line <b>70</b> (keeping in mind that the radius of curvature of the tube <b>70</b> will likely make the upper portion of the cross-section slightly curved and the side walls to be slightly wider at their top than at their bottom).</p>
<p id="p-0068" num="0067">It should be understood, however, that in alternate embodiments, the pressure-reducing flow channel <b>50</b> may be made in a variety of different shapes and sizes. For example, instead of having projections with pointed teeth, the baffles could be made with blunt or truncated teeth, with teeth that are angled or tapered, with curved or squared projections instead of triangular shaped teeth, with projections of other geometrical shapes or geometries, symmetric or asymmetric, etc.</p>
<p id="p-0069" num="0068">In the form illustrated, the pressure-reducing flow channel <b>50</b> also includes an intermediate bath <b>53</b> that the fluid pours into as it makes the turn in the generally U-shaped direction of travel which further causes pressure reduction as the water is flowing from a smaller passage to a larger passage in the bath <b>53</b>. After making the turn, the fluid passes or zigzags through another section of the pressure-reducing flow channel <b>50</b> and empties into outlet pool <b>40</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0070" num="0069">In addition to the pressure-reducing flow path <b>50</b>, the emitter <b>10</b> further includes a pressure compensating feature <b>60</b> which further allows the emitter <b>10</b> to compensate for increases in fluid pressure in the primary lumen of the tube <b>70</b>. More particularly, pressure compensating feature <b>60</b> allows the emitter <b>10</b> to maintain relatively constant outlet fluid flow and pressure even though the inlet fluid pressure may fluctuate from time-to-time. In the form illustrated, the pressure compensating feature <b>60</b> is a two part pressure compensation mechanism that comprises an elastomeric portion <b>61</b> capable of deflecting under pressure to reduce the cross-section of the pressure-reducing flow channel <b>50</b> and regulate fluid flow through the emitter, and a moveable baffle portion <b>62</b> capable of changing the length of the flow channel to compensate for changes in supply line <b>70</b> fluid pressure.</p>
<p id="p-0071" num="0070">The elastomeric portion <b>61</b> being a deflectable portion of the emitter body <b>20</b> that is moveable between a first position wherein at least a portion of the pressure-reducing flow channel <b>50</b> is of a first cross-section and a second position wherein the at least a portion of the pressure-reducing flow channel <b>50</b> is of a second cross-section, smaller than the first cross-section to regulate fluid flow through the emitter. In the form illustrated, the floor <b>61</b> of the flow channel <b>50</b> forms an elastomeric portion and raises and lowers in response to increases and decreases in supply line <b>70</b> fluid pressure, respectively. Thus, when fluid pressure increases in the supply line <b>70</b>, the floor <b>61</b> of the flow channel <b>50</b> is pressed-up or deflected up into the flow channel <b>50</b> thereby reducing the cross-section of the flow channel to regulate the flow of fluid through the emitter <b>10</b>. Conversely, when fluid pressure in the supply line <b>70</b> reduces, the floor of the flow channel <b>50</b> retreats from the flow channel back to a normal position wherein the floor is not deflected up into the flow channel thereby increasing the cross-section of the flow channel to allow fluid to flow more freely through the flow channel <b>50</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0072" num="0071">Although the above embodiment has been described with the floor of the flow path <b>50</b> deflecting up into the emitter flow path to reduce cross-section size of the flow path to compensate for increases in fluid pressure, it should be understood that in alternate embodiments, other emitter surfaces could be designed to either create this deflection on their own or to cooperate with the floor or other surface so that both deflect in order to compensate for fluid pressure increases. For example, rather than having the floor deflect, the side walls and/or ceiling of the flow channel <b>50</b> could be designed to deflect either in combination with any one of these items or on their own as the sole deflecting portion.</p>
<p id="p-0073" num="0072">The second part of the pressure compensation mechanism <b>60</b> comprises a moveable structure, such as moveable baffle portion <b>62</b>, which is capable of moving between a first low pressure position wherein the length of the flow channel <b>50</b> is of a first distance and a second high pressure position wherein the length of the flow channel <b>50</b> is of a second distance wherein the length of the flow channel is longer than the first distance to compensate for increase pressure in the supply line <b>70</b>. More particularly, in the form illustrated, the moveable baffle portion <b>62</b> deflects up and down with the floor of the flow channel <b>50</b> to sealingly engage and disengage the moveable baffle portion <b>62</b> with the inner wall of the supply line <b>70</b>, respectively, and thereby lengthen or shorten the extent of the flow channel for at least some fluid flowing therethrough to compensate for changes in supply line fluid pressure.</p>
<p id="p-0074" num="0073">As best illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>1</b>C</figref>, D and G, the moveable baffle portion <b>62</b> comprises a tapered portion of the central or inner baffle wall <b>51</b> that tapers down away from the inner surface of supply line <b>70</b> so that at lower fluid pressures in supply line <b>70</b>, fluid flows through the inlet <b>30</b> and first section (or upstream section) of flow channel <b>50</b> and then over the top of the tapered baffle section <b>62</b>, through the second section (or downstream section) of the flow channel <b>50</b> and then into outlet pool <b>40</b>. Fluid may flow through the remaining portion of the flow channel <b>50</b> including intermediate bath <b>53</b> (located between the upstream and downstream sections of the flow channel <b>50</b>), but it does not have to nor does all of the fluid flow through these portions of the flow channel <b>50</b> due to the gap between the upper surface of the tapered inner baffle wall section <b>52</b> and the inner surface of tube <b>70</b>. As fluid pressure increases in the fluid supply line <b>70</b>, and as best illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b>H</figref>, the floor of the flow channel <b>50</b> starts to deflect upwards and into the flow channel <b>50</b> moving the tapered baffle section <b>62</b> toward the inner surface of tube <b>70</b> thereby reducing the gap between these two until the upper surface of the tapered baffle section <b>62</b> sealingly engages the inner wall of the tube <b>70</b> thereby preventing fluid from flowing over the top of the tapered baffle section <b>62</b> and lengthening the amount of the flow channel <b>50</b> through which all of the fluid must flow and reducing fluid pressure and flow due to same.</p>
<p id="p-0075" num="0074">The emitter body <b>20</b> further defines an outlet area <b>40</b> which forms a pool into which the fluid that passes through inlet <b>30</b> and tortuous passage <b>50</b> and pressure compensation mechanism <b>60</b> collects or gathers. An outlet in outer supply line <b>70</b>, such as opening <b>71</b>, provides access to the fluid collected in the outlet pool <b>40</b> and, more particularly, provides an egress for the fluid to trickle or drip out of emitter <b>10</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0076" num="0075">Since the emitter <b>10</b> is made of an integral body <b>20</b>, the outlet area <b>40</b> is provided with obstructions or stops, such as posts or nubs <b>41</b>, that prevent the outlet area <b>40</b> from collapsing when the fluid pressure of supply line <b>70</b> raises to a level sufficient for deflecting the floor of the flow channel <b>50</b> into the flow channel <b>50</b> to reduce the cross-section of same and regulate fluid flow through the flow channel (or as the moveable structure <b>62</b> moves from the first or low pressure position to the second or high pressure position). In the form illustrated, the posts <b>41</b> extend away from the body <b>20</b> and are generally frustoconical in shape to make the posts easier to mold when the body <b>20</b> is molded. In addition, in a preferred form, the upper surfaces of the posts <b>41</b> have a radius of curvature common to the radius of curvature of the upper surfaces of baffles <b>51</b>, <b>52</b> and that corresponds with a second radius of curvature of the inner wall of tube <b>70</b>. The solid nature of the baffle walls <b>51</b>, <b>52</b> and outer rim or peripheral wall of emitter body <b>20</b> likewise prevent these portions of the emitter body <b>20</b> from collapsing when the fluid pressure of supply line <b>70</b> pushes the floor of the flow channel <b>50</b> into the flow channel.</p>
<p id="p-0077" num="0076">Although the form illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>1</b>A-D</figref> shows the outlet <b>71</b> of outer tube <b>70</b> as a round opening, it should be understood that in alternate embodiments, this may be provided in a variety of different shapes and sizes. For example, in one form, the outer tube outlet <b>71</b> may be provided in the form of a slit, such as an elongated narrow oval shape, instead of a round hole. In other forms, the outer tube outlet <b>71</b> may further define a pressure reducing passageway such as a tortuous or zigzag passage.</p>
<p id="p-0078" num="0077">By using a unitary emitter body <b>20</b> to form the inlet <b>30</b>, flow channel <b>50</b>, outlet <b>40</b> and pressure compensating mechanism <b>60</b> rather than requiring multiple parts to be constructed and assembled to form such features, the emitter <b>10</b> is much easier to manufacture and provides significant cost savings due to the reduction in parts and materials, and assembly time. The body <b>20</b> may be made of any type of material capable of allowing for this type of movement for pressure compensation. In a preferred form, however, the body <b>20</b> is made of TPO having a Durometer reading ranging between 25 and 100, with the Durometer reading preferably being between 50 and 75. In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>1</b>I-J</figref>, data is provided for the amount of deflection per increase in pressure for materials having Durometer readings of 50 and 75, respectively. In these examples, data was collected at location points <b>1</b> and <b>2</b>, as indicated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b>B</figref>, with the distance (or gap) between the inner surface of tube <b>70</b> and the upper surface of the tapered inner baffle wall portion <b>62</b> being thirty thousandths of an inch (0.030&#x2033;) at location point <b>1</b> and thirteen thousandths of an inch (0.013&#x2033;) at location point <b>2</b>, and the floor thickness of flow channel <b>50</b> being eight thousandths of an inch (0.008&#x2033;). These distances being calculated when the tapered baffle wall portion <b>62</b> is at its normal position (or low pressure/non-deflected position), as illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b>G</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0079" num="0078">As can be seen in comparing <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>1</b>I-J</figref>, a quicker movement of the tapered baffle wall portion <b>62</b> and corresponding lengthening of the flow channel <b>50</b> can be achieved using a material with a lower Durometer reading (e.g., a softer material), whereas a more constant movement (almost linear at times) of the tapered baffle wall portion <b>62</b> may be achieved by using a material with a higher Durometer reading (e.g., a harder material). Thus, the specific application the emitter <b>10</b> is intended for may play a role in the material selected for emitter body <b>20</b> (e.g., if a quicker lengthening of the flow channel <b>50</b> is desired a material with a lower Durometer reading will be used, whereas if a more gradual closing of the tapered baffle wall portion <b>62</b> and more gradual lengthening of the flow channel <b>50</b> is desired, a material with a higher Durometer reading will be used, etc.).</p>
<p id="p-0080" num="0079">In order to ensure the consistency of operation for each emitter <b>10</b> mounted to the extruded supply line <b>70</b>, care is taken to make sure that the various portions of body <b>20</b> are constructed with consistent thickness and density from one emitter to the next and that the distances between location points <b>1</b> and <b>2</b> and the inner surface of supply line <b>70</b> are maintained consistently from one emitter to the next. In doing so, the emitters <b>10</b> mounted to the supply line <b>70</b> should operate in a uniform manner and produce common low pressure fluid flow and flow rates at their respective outputs <b>40</b> (e.g., the flow rate of the first emitter mounted in the supply line should operate the same as the last emitter mounted in the supply line).</p>
<p id="p-0081" num="0080">In an alternate form, the emitter and drip line may be made-up of a multi-part construction and/or use a multi-step manufacturing or assembly process. For example, an emitter body of a first type of material may be combined with another type of material (e.g., a structure, a layer, a coating, etc.) that is more easily bonded to conventional drip tubing so that emitter can be bonded to the tubing in a more consistent manner and each emitter is ensured to work similar to one another. More particularly, since soft materials, such as silicon, do not always bond easily to the various types of conventional drip line tubing used in the industry, which is typically polyethylene tubing, the emitter body may be made-up of a combination of soft and hard materials to assist in the bonding of the emitter to the extruded tubing and to provide a process that can repeatedly bond such emitters to extruded tubing so that there is no significant (if any) variance in bonding between the emitters bonded to the tubing.</p>
<p id="p-0082" num="0081">For example, by combining a soft material like silicon with a hard material like a polyethylene, the hard portion of the emitter may more easily be bonded to the extruded tubing in a uniform and repeatable fashion. Although this form of emitter and tubing may be considered by some to be a two-part construction, it would preferably remain housingless and the soft portion of the emitter would make up the majority of the component. For example, in one form, the hard portion of the emitter would simply comprise a polyethylene coating applied to an upper surface of the emitter to assist in consistently bonding the emitter to the inner surface of the drip line tubing in a manner that can be repeated easily from emitter to emitter. Not all of the upper surfaces of the emitter body need to be coated with the polyethylene coating and/or connected to the inner surface of the drip line tubing. Thus, in this example, the emitter continues to comprise a singular or uniform structure through which fluid flows that simply has a bonding layer or agent of polyethylene which assists in connecting the emitter to the inner surface of the drip line tubing. In addition, this configuration would still produce an emitter that can process grit better than conventional emitters, including those with multi-part housings, diaphragms and metering grooves. In alternate forms, true two-piece constructions may be used to form the emitter body if desired with either piece making up a majority of the structure or both making-up equal portions of the structure and/or either piece or both making up portions of the inlet, flow channel or outlet as desired.</p>
<p id="p-0083" num="0082">Turning now back to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>1</b>A-F</figref>, a housingless irrigation drip emitter <b>10</b> is provided for attachment to only a portion of an inner circumference of an inner surface of an irrigation drip line tube <b>70</b> having an elastomeric emitter body <b>20</b> integrally defining an inlet <b>30</b> for receiving pressurized fluid from a fluid supply source, an outlet area <b>40</b> for discharging the fluid from the body <b>20</b>, a pressure reducing flow path <b>50</b> extending between the inlet <b>30</b> and the outlet area <b>40</b> for reducing the pressure and flow of fluid received at the inlet <b>30</b> and discharged through the outlet area <b>40</b>, and a pressure compensating portion <b>60</b> for automatically adjusting the pressure and fluid flow reducing effect of the flow channel <b>50</b> in response to a change in pressure of the fluid supply source <b>70</b>, wherein the pressure reducing flow channel <b>50</b> includes an inner baffle wall <b>51</b> and an outer baffle wall <b>52</b> that extends about the inner baffle wall <b>51</b> in a generally U-shaped manner. The baffle walls <b>51</b>, <b>52</b> having upper surfaces that have a first radius of curvature that corresponds with a second radius of curvature of an inner wall of the irrigation drip line tube <b>70</b>, and the inner baffle wall <b>51</b> having a first portion of constant height and a second portion <b>62</b> of tapering height, the second portion <b>62</b> being moveable between a first position wherein the upper surface of the second portion <b>62</b> is not level with the upper surface of the first portion such that fluid can flow over the upper surface of the second portion at predetermined low fluid pressures and a second position wherein the upper surface of at least a portion of the second portion <b>62</b> is level with the upper surface of the first portion and fluid cannot flow over the level upper surfaces of the second portion <b>62</b> such that the cross-section of the flow channel is reduced and the length of the flow channel is effectively lengthened.</p>
<p id="p-0084" num="0083">In the form illustrated, the baffles of the inner and outer baffle walls <b>51</b>, <b>52</b> do not close sequentially when the second portion <b>62</b> of inner baffle <b>51</b> moves from the first position to the second position, but rather, the teeth of the baffle walls <b>51</b>, <b>52</b> on opposite ends of the flow passage <b>50</b> (i.e., some on the inlet end and some on the outlet end) close at the same time. This allows the moving portion <b>62</b> of inner baffle <b>51</b> to gradually lengthen the extent of the flow passage <b>50</b> as supply line fluid pressure increases and to gradually shorten the extent of the flow passage <b>50</b> as supply line fluid pressure decreases without having to worry about trying to sequentially close the baffles of the pressure-reducing passage <b>50</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0085" num="0084">In alternate embodiments, it should be understood that alternate portions of the emitter body <b>20</b> may be moved to compensate for increases in fluid line pressure, either in conjunction with or in lieu of those discussed above.

<p id="p-0092" num="0091">Unlike the embodiments discussed above, however, the inlet <b>230</b> of emitter body <b>220</b> comprises a plurality of inlet openings <b>232</b>, <b>233</b>, <b>234</b>, <b>235</b>, <b>236</b> and <b>237</b>.

In addition, the height of the bosses <b>233</b><i>a</i>-<b>237</b><i>a </i>are varied so that the inlets <b>233</b>-<b>237</b> close sequentially starting with the inlet furthest from the initial inlet opening <b>232</b> (i.e., which in the illustrated example is inlet <b>237</b>) and then moving to the inlet that is the next furthest (i.e., <b>236</b>), then the next furthest (i.e., <b>235</b>) and so on. By closing the inlets <b>233</b>-<b>237</b> in this order (i.e., starting with the inlet furthest downstream and moving upstream), the emitter body <b>220</b> actually lengthens the pressure-reducing passage <b>250</b> with each sequential closing for all fluid flowing therethrough which allows the emitter to compensate for increases in the supply line fluid pressure. Conversely, as supply line fluid pressure decreases, the emitter body opens the inlets <b>233</b>-<b>237</b> beginning with the inlet furthest upstream and moving downstream, which allows the emitter to shorten the pressure-reducing passage <b>250</b> for some of the fluid flowing through the emitter to compensate for the reduction in supply line fluid pressure.</p>
<p id="p-0094" num="0093">In the form illustrated, it is contemplated that each of inlet openings <b>233</b>-<b>237</b> will close during normal operation of the emitter <b>210</b>, or that the emitter body <b>220</b> will be designed such that inlet openings <b>233</b>-<b>237</b> will normally close at some point during the operation of the emitter due to expected increases in supply line fluid pressure (i.e., that enough pressure is expected to be reached that will cause inlets <b>233</b>-<b>237</b> to close at some point or another). However, it should be understood that in alternate embodiments, the emitter body <b>220</b> may be designed to only shut one or more of the inlets <b>233</b>-<b>237</b> during normal or expected supply line fluid pressure conditions and only having the remaining inlets <b>233</b>-<b>237</b> close under extraordinary conditions (e.g., when supply line fluid pressures are reached that are much greater than normal or expected pressures). This can either be done by altering the size of the emitter body <b>220</b> or any of its features (e.g., inlet opening, floor thickness, baffle wall size, flow path cross-section, etc.) or by using different materials for body <b>220</b> (e.g., materials with different Durometer values, different compositions that make the body <b>220</b> harder or less flexible, etc.). Conversely, the emitter body <b>220</b> may be made of materials that allow for inlets <b>233</b>-<b>237</b> to close more rapidly if desired (e.g., by altering body features and/or selecting different materials as discussed above). In this way, the emitter <b>10</b> can be customized for specific applications.</p>
<p id="p-0095" num="0094">Thus, with this configuration, an irrigation drip emitter <b>210</b> is provided for attachment to only a portion of an inner circumference of an inner surface of an irrigation drip line tube <b>270</b> having an elastomeric emitter body <b>220</b> integrally defining an inlet <b>230</b> for receiving pressurized fluid from a fluid supply source, an outlet area <b>240</b> for discharging the fluid from the body <b>220</b>, a pressure reducing flow path <b>250</b> extending between the inlet <b>230</b> and the outlet area <b>240</b> for reducing the pressure and flow of fluid received at the inlet <b>230</b> and discharged through the outlet area <b>240</b>, and a pressure compensating portion <b>260</b> for automatically adjusting the pressure and fluid flow reducing effect of the flow channel <b>250</b> in response to a change in pressure of the fluid supply source <b>270</b>, wherein the pressure reducing flow channel <b>250</b> includes an inner baffle wall <b>251</b> and an outer baffle wall <b>252</b> that extends about the inner baffle wall <b>251</b> in a generally U-shaped manner.

<p id="p-0096" num="0095">It should be understood that in alternate embodiments, the sleeves or bosses <b>233</b><i>a</i>-<b>237</b><i>a </i>may take on other shapes and sizes as may be desired for specific applications. For example, in some applications, inlets with rectangular cross sections may be desired over the round inlets depicted in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>3</b>A-G</figref>. In yet other forms, inlet passages that serve some form of pressure reduction, such as passages that define tortuous paths, may be desired. In still other embodiments, fewer or more inlet openings or bosses may be provided than those shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>3</b>A-G</figref> if desired. For example, in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b></figref>, an alternate drip emitter and drip line is illustrated having an inlet made-up of a plurality of inlet openings. In keeping with the above practice, features that are common to those discussed above will use the same two-digit reference numeral, but having the prefix &#x201c;3&#x201d; merely to distinguish one embodiment from another.</p>
<p id="p-0097" num="0096">In the form illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b></figref>, the plurality of inlets are shaped like elongated openings, such as slits or slots <b>330</b>, which not only allow fluid to flow through the inlet of the emitter <b>310</b>, but also help filter or deflect particulates such as grit away from the emitter <b>310</b> to help ensure the fluid flowing through the emitter <b>310</b> is free of such particulates so that the particulates do not interfere with the operation of the emitter <b>310</b>. The plurality of openings <b>330</b> have longitudinal axes that parallel the longitudinal axis of the emitter <b>310</b>, however, in alternate forms, it should be understood that the plurality of openings may take on a variety of different shapes and sizes and may be oriented in different ways so as not to have longitudinal axes parallel to the longitudinal axis of the emitter <b>310</b> (if even having longitudinal axes).</p>
<p id="p-0098" num="0097">In alternate forms, it should be understood that the inlet or inlets of the emitter may be placed in certain positions to help determine how the emitter will operate. For example, in some forms, an inlet opening may be positioned further upstream to effectively shorten the length of the pressure-reducing flow channel and create an emitter that has a higher fluid flow rate (e.g., four gallons per hour or 4 GPH). In another form, the inlet opening may be positioned further downstream to effectively lengthen the pressure-reducing flow channel and create an emitter that has a lower flow rate (e.g., 1 GPH). In still another form, the inlet opening may be positioned somewhere in-between the above mentioned locations to create an emitter with an intermediate pressure-reducing flow channel length that has a flow rate somewhere in-between the other flow rates (e.g., 2 GPH). The changing of this inlet location could be accomplished by having a readily adjustable mold (e.g., one where the location of the inlet opening can be slid or moved between the desired locations) or, alternatively, separate molds could be made for each embodiment (i.e., one for the low flow rate emitter, another for the intermediate flow rate emitter, and another for the high flow rate emitter).</p>
<p id="p-0099" num="0098">The same may be true for outlet openings. For example, when manufacturing the drip line, the location of the outlet opening may be altered to affect how the emitter will operate. The outlet opening could be located further upstream to effectively shorten the pressure-reducing flow channel and create an emitter with a higher flow rate (e.g., 4 GPH). In another form, the outlet opening may be located further downstream to effectively lengthen the pressure-reducing flow channel and create an emitter with a lower flow rate (e.g., 1 GPH). In another form, the outlet opening may be positioned somewhere between the above mentioned locations to effectively create an emitter with an intermediate pressure-reducing flow channel length that operates with a fluid flow rate somewhere between the above-mentioned flow rates (e.g., 2 GPH). The outlet opening may be formed in the drip line tubing before or after the emitter is bonded to the inner surface of the tubing, however, in a preferred form, the opening will be formed after the emitter is bonded to the inner surface of the tubing. The opening is typically formed via a die, press, awl or the like. Thus, adjustments to the location of where the outlet opening can be made by adjusting where this puncture occurs in the tubing.</p>
<p id="p-0100" num="0099">In addition, in some forms, color may be added to the individual emitters and/or the drip line and methods of manufacturing same to distinguish these products or product lines from one another or to signify something relating to the items intended use or application. For example, one color may be used to identify an emitter or dip line that drips at a rate of one gallon per hour (1 GPH), another color may be used to identify an emitter or drip line that drips at a rate of two gallons per hour (2 GPH), another color may be used to identify an emitter or drip line that drips at four gallons per hour (4 GPH). In one form, emitters of different flow rates are distinguished by color so that workers can more easily determine which emitters are to be inserted into extruded tubing during assembly in order to obtain a drip line with common emitter drip rates. In another form, the extruded tubing may be made in a specific color or have a marking of a specific color to designate the flow rate of the drip emitters located therein in order to help workers and/or end users distinguish drip lines of different drip rates. In still other forms, both the emitters and the tubing may include color to specify the drip rate or intended application. In other forms, colors may be used to signify the source of fluid to be used with the emitter or drip line or the particular application for which the emitter or drip line is to be used. For example, the color purple is often used to indicate that reclaimed or recycled water is being used. Thus, the emitter or drip line could be marked with this color to indicate that the emitter or drip line is intended for these types of applications or to indicate the type of fluid that is supposed to travel through these types of emitters/drip lines. If desired, any of the embodiments and methods disclosed herein could include the addition of color for such purposes.</p>
<p id="p-0101" num="0100">Turning back to the embodiment of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b></figref>, it should be appreciated that in this form, the emitter <b>310</b> includes a baffle design having teeth extending from the sides of the emitter body <b>320</b> toward one another to form the tortuous flow passage <b>350</b> without a central baffle portion. The height of each tooth is higher at the sides of the emitter body <b>320</b> than at the distal end of each tooth and, as fluid pressure increases, the floor <b>361</b> of flow channel <b>350</b> moves up toward the inner surface of the tube <b>370</b> causing the portions of the teeth closest to the sides of the emitter body <b>320</b> to close against (e.g., touch, engage, etc.) the inner surface of the tube <b>370</b> first, before gradually closing more and more of each tooth against the inner surface of tube <b>370</b> simultaneously until the floor <b>361</b> cannot move any further. Thus, rather than closing the baffle teeth consecutively or sequentially against the inner surface of tube <b>370</b> to lengthen the pressure-reducing flow passage <b>350</b> and compensate for the increase in pressure, this configuration allows each tooth to gradually close against the inner surface of tube <b>370</b> simultaneously in response to increases in line pressure thereby lengthening the pressure-reducing flow passage <b>350</b> and reducing the cross-section of the pressure-reducing flow channel <b>350</b> to form a pressure compensating mechanism <b>360</b> that compensates for increases and decreases in line pressure. For convenience, only a portion of tube <b>370</b> is illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b></figref> so that a portion of the emitter body <b>320</b> remains visible, however, it should be understood that the tube <b>370</b> would extend over the entire emitter body <b>320</b> and that the emitter body <b>320</b> would be bonded to the inner surface of the tube in a manner similar to that discussed above.</p>
<p id="p-0102" num="0101">In the form illustrated, fluid flowing through the drip line <b>370</b> enters the emitter <b>310</b> via inlet openings <b>330</b>, travels through the tortuous passage <b>350</b> and then exits the emitter <b>310</b> via outlet opening <b>371</b>. The pressure compensating mechanism <b>360</b> reduces the cross-section of the flow channel <b>350</b> by raising the floor <b>361</b> of flow channel <b>350</b> and pressing more of the upper surfaces of the baffle teeth into engagement with the inside surface of the tubing <b>370</b> as fluid pressure increases, and increases the cross-section of the flow channel <b>350</b> by allowing the floor <b>361</b> of flow channel <b>350</b> to move away from the inner surface of tubing <b>370</b> as fluid pressure decreases. This configuration also provides a large central flow path down the middle of the pressure-reducing flow channel <b>350</b> which allows for easier processing of grit or other particulates, particularly at start-up and shutdown of fluid flow due to the low pressures associated with same and due to the fact the portion of the flow channel <b>350</b> with the largest cross-sectional area will always remain in the middle of the emitter <b>310</b> and, specifically, at the longitudinal axis of the flow channel <b>350</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0103" num="0102"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>5</b>A-B</figref> are perspective views of an alternate drip emitter and drip line embodying features of the present invention wherein the pressure-reducing flow channel is made-up of baffles with flexible teeth that move in response to fluid flow through the emitter body. In keeping with above practices, items that are common to those discussed above will use the same two digit reference numeral but with the addition of the prefix &#x201c;4&#x201d; to distinguish one embodiment from another. In the form illustrated, only a portion of the tube <b>470</b> is illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b>A</figref> so that the details of emitter body <b>420</b> may be seen, however, it should be understood that the entire emitter body <b>420</b> would be inserted within the tube <b>470</b> and connected to an inner surface of tube <b>470</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0104" num="0103">The emitter <b>410</b> includes a plurality of flexible baffle walls extending from opposite sides of the emitter body <b>420</b> toward one another and in a staggered arrangement so one wall is not directly opposite a wall on the other side of the emitter body <b>420</b>. In the form illustrated, the baffle walls form flexible teeth that are much narrower than those discussed above and form generally rectangular walls connected at their base to the floor <b>461</b> of the pressure-reducing flow channel <b>450</b> and on one side to the side of the emitter body <b>420</b>. Thus, when fluid flows through the supply line <b>470</b>, at least a portion of the fluid flows through the inlet opening <b>430</b>, through the tortuous passage <b>450</b> defined by the baffle walls <b>452</b>, to the outlet <b>440</b> and through outlet opening <b>471</b>. As the supply line fluid pressure increases, the floor of the flow channel <b>461</b> moves toward the inner surface of tube <b>470</b> driving the tops of the baffle walls into engagement with the inner surface of the supply line tubing <b>470</b> and, thereby, restricting or reducing the cross-sectional area of the flow channel <b>450</b> and/or increasing the length of the flow channel <b>450</b> in response to the increase in pressure in order to compensate for the supply line fluid pressure increase. As the fluid pressure in the supply line continues to increase, the baffle walls <b>452</b> closest to inlet <b>430</b> flex or bend over in the direction of the fluid flow. This occurs because the pressure of the fluid is always greater than the pressure of the floor <b>461</b> raising the baffle walls <b>452</b> into engagement with the inner surface of the tube <b>470</b>. As fluid pressure increases further within tube <b>470</b>, more and more of the flexible baffle walls <b>452</b> will flex or bend in the direction of the fluid flow which can also help the emitter process obstructions such as grit or other particulates by allowing the baffle walls to bend so that the obstructions can be carried through the flow channel and out of the emitter <b>410</b>. Conversely, when fluid pressure decreases in the supply line <b>470</b>, the baffle walls cease bending and return to their normal positions (e.g., as illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b>A</figref>) and the floor <b>461</b> lowers, allowing the walls <b>452</b> to move away from the inner surface of tube <b>470</b> and thereby increasing the cross-sectional area of the flow path <b>450</b> and/or reducing the length of the flow channel <b>450</b> to account for the decrease in fluid pressure. In this way, emitter <b>410</b> is equipped with a pressure compensating mechanism <b>460</b> like some of the other embodiments discussed herein.</p>
<p id="p-0105" num="0104">Although the embodiment illustrated shows circular inlets and outlet openings <b>430</b> and <b>471</b>, it should be understood that in alternate embodiments, these inlet and outlet openings may take on a variety of different shapes and sizes. In addition, in alternate forms, the emitter body <b>420</b> may be designed with larger pools or baths located at the inlet <b>430</b> and outlet <b>440</b> (like the embodiment of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>1</b>A-H</figref>), instead of directly transitioning to the tortuous flow passage <b>450</b> as illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>5</b>A-B</figref>. Furthermore, the flexible baffle walls <b>452</b> disclosed in this embodiment could easily be used in any of the other embodiments disclosed herein, just like any of the features of the various embodiments discussed herein could be mixed and matched together to form another embodiment regardless of which embodiment the specific feature is currently illustrated in. Thus, in one form, the flexible teeth <b>452</b> may be used in an embodiment more like that shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>1</b>A-H</figref> (e.g., with a U-shaped tortuous passage). In still other forms, the flexible teeth <b>452</b> may be attached to the emitter body <b>420</b> in such a way as to be predisposed to flex or bend in a preferred direction. For example, rather than having the flexible teeth <b>452</b> bend in the same direction the fluid flows through the emitter <b>410</b>, the teeth <b>452</b> could be predisposed with an angle causing the teeth <b>452</b> to bend in a direction opposite the fluid flow in order to cause more turbulence and interference with the fluid flowing through the emitter <b>410</b>. As mentioned above, however, in a preferred form of the embodiment of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>5</b>A-B</figref>, the baffle walls <b>452</b> will bend in the same direction as the fluid flow.</p>
<p id="p-0106" num="0105">Yet another embodiment of an alternate drip emitter and drip line in accordance with the invention is illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>6</b>A-D</figref>. As with the other embodiments discussed herein, this embodiment will use the same two digit reference numeral to refer to items similar to those discussed above, but will include the prefix &#x201c;5&#x201d; to distinguish one embodiment from the others. Thus, in the form illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>6</b>A-D</figref>, the emitter <b>510</b> includes an emitter body <b>520</b> having an inlet <b>530</b>, outlet <b>540</b> and tortuous flow path <b>550</b> extending therebetween; however, unlike the previous embodiments discussed herein, the baffle walls <b>552</b> include at least one hollow portion which fills with fluid as the supply line fluid pressure increases in order to reduce the cross-sectional area and/or increase the length of the flow channel <b>550</b> to compensate for an increase in fluid pressure.</p>
<p id="p-0107" num="0106">More particularly, in the form illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>6</b>A-D</figref>, the teeth <b>552</b> of the baffle walls are hollowed-out or define an opening or void <b>554</b> in order to allow supply line fluid to fill the void <b>554</b> of the hollow teeth <b>552</b> (or the space <b>554</b> defined by each hollow tooth) and, as supply line fluid pressure increases, to swell or enlarge the size of each tooth <b>552</b> by filling this void with pressurized fluid and thereby causing the size of the teeth to grow/expand and reduce the cross-sectional area of the flow channel <b>550</b> to compensate for the increase in the fluid pressure. A view of the bottom of emitter body <b>520</b> (which is the side of the emitter facing the fluid flowing through supply line <b>570</b>) is illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>6</b>D</figref> showing the void <b>554</b> and illustrating how some of the supply line fluid is able to flow along the bottom surface of the emitter body <b>520</b>, fill the voids <b>554</b> of the hollow teeth, enter the inlet <b>530</b> of the emitter and/or continue flowing down the supply line <b>570</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0108" num="0107">As fluid pressure increases, the floor of the emitter <b>561</b> will also move upwards and, thus, the upper surfaces of the baffle walls <b>552</b> will gradually engage more and more of the inner surface of tube <b>570</b> thereby increasing the length of the tortuous passage <b>550</b> that the fluid must flow through in order to compensate for the increase in fluid pressure. Conversely, when fluid pressure decreases, the floor <b>561</b> will drop, gradually disengaging the baffle walls <b>552</b> from the inner surface of the tube <b>570</b> and the teeth <b>552</b> will shrink or reduce in size to effectively increase the cross-sectional area of the flow path <b>550</b> and reduce the length of the tortuous passage that the fluid must flow through to compensate for the reduction in fluid pressure. Thus, like the previous embodiments discussed herein, the emitter <b>510</b> is equipped with both a pressure-reducing flow path <b>550</b> and a pressure compensating mechanism <b>560</b> for ensuring that each emitter operates uniformly and as desired.</p>
<p id="p-0109" num="0108">In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>6</b>A</figref>, the supply line fluid pressure is low and, thus, the teeth of baffle walls <b>552</b> are not enlarged and the upper surfaces of the baffle walls are not fully engaged with the inner surface of the supply line tube <b>570</b>. This reduces the length of the flow channel <b>550</b> that the fluid must flow through and allows for the flow channel <b>550</b> to have a maximum cross-sectional area. In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>6</b>B</figref>, the supply line fluid pressure has increased some to a generally intermediate level of pressure such that the teeth of baffle walls <b>552</b> have enlarged a bit and the upper surfaces of the baffle walls nearest the side of emitter body <b>520</b> begin to engage the inner surface of supply line tube <b>570</b>. This increases the length of the flow channel <b>550</b> that the fluid must flow through and reduces the cross-sectional area of the flow channel <b>550</b> to account for or compensate for the increase in fluid pressure. In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>6</b>C</figref>, the supply line fluid pressure has increased further to a high level of pressure such that the teeth of the baffle walls <b>552</b> have grown or enlarged to their maximum size (or close to their maximum size) and the upper surfaces of the baffles fully engage the inner surface of the supply line tube <b>570</b>. This further increases the length of the flow channel <b>550</b> that the fluid must flow through (thereby maximizing the amount of pressure-reduction taking place via flow channel <b>550</b>) and reduces the cross-sectional area of the flow channel <b>550</b> to its smallest cross-sectional area to compensate for the increase in fluid pressure. In addition, the baffle teeth <b>552</b> in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>6</b>C</figref> are shown tipping or bending in the direction of the fluid flow (similar to that shown with respect to the embodiment of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>5</b>A-B</figref>). Thus, with this configuration, the pressure-reducing flow channel has a first cross-sectional area at lower fluid pressures, a second cross-sectional area, smaller than the first, at higher fluid pressures to compensate for the increase in fluid pressure so that the emitter and drip line trickle fluid at a generally constant or desired rate, and a plurality of gradually decreasing cross-sectional areas as the fluid pressure increases from the pressure that exists at the first cross-sectional area to the pressure at the second cross-sectional area.</p>

<p id="p-0111" num="0110">Another emitter embodying features of the present invention is shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>7</b>A-I</figref>. In keeping with the above practices, this embodiment will use the same latter two-digit reference numerals to describe items that are similar to those discussed above, but will include the prefix &#x201c;6&#x201d; merely to distinguish one embodiment from another (e.g., emitter body will be referenced as <b>620</b> indicating it is similar to prior emitter bodies <b>520</b>, <b>420</b>, <b>320</b>, <b>220</b>, <b>120</b> and <b>20</b>).</p>
<p id="p-0112" num="0111">In this embodiment, the emitter <b>620</b> is made of an elastomeric material and defines a single pressure reducing flow channel or passage <b>650</b> laid out in a generally straight pattern like those illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>4</b>-<b>6</b>D</figref> above, rather than a curved or U-shaped pattern like those illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>1</b>A-<b>3</b>G</figref>. The flow channel <b>650</b> has a plurality of teeth extending from outer baffle walls <b>552</b> that move in response to changes in fluid pressure in order to provide a pressure compensating emitter. In this particular embodiment, however, the unitary emitter body <b>620</b> defines first and second outer baffle walls <b>652</b><i>a</i>, <b>652</b><i>c </i>that are interconnected via hinge or joint <b>652</b><i>e</i>. The baffles of first wall <b>652</b><i>a </i>extend into the flow path via teeth <b>652</b><i>b </i>and the baffles of wall <b>652</b><i>c </i>extend out into the flow path via teeth <b>652</b><i>d</i>. When fluid pressure increases, the walls <b>652</b><i>a</i>, <b>652</b><i>c </i>and their respective teeth <b>652</b><i>b</i>, <b>652</b><i>d </i>are moved from a first or static position wherein the walls and teeth are spaced apart from one another to a second, higher or high pressure position wherein the walls and teeth are squeezed closer together to one another thereby reducing the cross-section of the fluid passage <b>650</b> and restricting the amount of fluid that is allowed to flow through emitter <b>620</b> and reducing the flow rate of same. In this way, the entire fluid passage <b>650</b> is capable of serving as the pressure compensating member <b>660</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0113" num="0112">More particularly and as best shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>7</b>B, <b>7</b>C</figref>-E, <b>7</b>G and <b>71</b>, the unitary emitter body <b>620</b> defines an inlet <b>630</b>, outlet <b>640</b> and having first wall <b>652</b><i>a </i>and second wall <b>652</b><i>c </i>between the inlet <b>630</b> and the outlet <b>640</b>. The first and second walls <b>652</b><i>a</i>, <b>652</b><i>c </i>define a pressure reduction or reducing flow channel <b>650</b> and having interconnecting member or interconnection <b>650</b><i>e </i>between one another. In this way, emitter <b>620</b> operates similar to emitter <b>520</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>6</b>A-D</figref>) in that increases in fluid pressure result in lateral or sideways movement or growth of teeth <b>652</b><i>b</i>, <b>652</b><i>d </i>to reduce the size of the flow path <b>650</b> and, in particular, the effective cross-section of the flow passage <b>650</b>.</p>

This configuration means that the intermediate portion <b>650</b><i>f </i>of the flow channel <b>650</b> will have the maximum length or height for baffles <b>652</b><i>b</i>, <b>652</b><i>d</i>, and that this portion of the flow channel <b>650</b> will be affected first in relation to fluid pressure increases due to it offering more surface area than other portions of the flow channel <b>650</b>. Thus, the flow channel <b>650</b> will be squeezed or pinched in the intermediate area <b>650</b><i>f </i>of the emitter first, before elsewhere along the flow channel (e.g., before the portions at or near the input and output ends <b>630</b>, <b>640</b>).</p>
<p id="p-0116" num="0115">As best illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>7</b>C and <b>7</b>D</figref>, the baffles <b>652</b><i>b</i>, <b>652</b><i>d </i>are preferably tooth shaped, having the edges of the baffles <b>652</b><i>b </i>for the first wall <b>652</b><i>a </i>overlap with the edges of baffles <b>652</b><i>d </i>for the second wall <b>652</b><i>c</i>. In the form illustrated, the overlap is approximately twenty-thousandths of an inch (0.020&#x2033;) with the teeth <b>652</b><i>b</i>, <b>652</b><i>d </i>varying in length or height from thirty-thousandths of an inch (0.030&#x2033;) to one hundred-thousandths of an inch (0.100&#x2033;) and having a maximum flow gap when the first and second walls <b>652</b><i>a</i>, <b>652</b><i>c </i>are in their static or non-moved position of thirty-thousandths of an inch (0.030&#x2033;)(the bridge gap between first and second walls <b>652</b><i>a</i>, <b>652</b><i>c </i>being approximately fifty-thousandths of an inch (0.050&#x2033;). It should be understood, however, that in alternate embodiments these dimensions may be changed and instead of having an overlap between teeth <b>652</b><i>b</i>, <b>652</b><i>d</i>, a gap may be maintained to assist with flushing the emitter <b>650</b> of obstructions such as grit (as discussed above).</p>
<p id="p-0117" num="0116">Another difference with respect to emitter <b>620</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>7</b>A-I</figref> and prior embodiments is that the emitter <b>620</b> defines an outlet bath <b>640</b> that has projections such as walls or posts/stanchions <b>641</b> to prevent the outlet pool <b>640</b> from collapsing under increases in fluid pressure. In this way, these structures <b>641</b> are similar to the nubs discussed above (e.g., <b>41</b>, <b>141</b> and <b>241</b>), however, they connect to the outer wall of the emitter <b>620</b>, the wall that defines the bath <b>640</b>, rather than rising up from the surface of the floor of the outlet <b>640</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0118" num="0117">As with earlier embodiments, the emitter <b>620</b> has a top surface that is capable of being attached to the inside surface of a conduit (not show) at predetermined intervals thereof in order to form a drip line using said emitter. Unlike prior embodiments which used guide ribs (e.g., <b>25</b>-<b>29</b>), the emitter body <b>620</b> uses guide recesses or slots <b>621</b> and <b>624</b> for aligning the emitter <b>620</b> and inserting same into the conduit during constructions, preferably as the conduit is extruded. The inlet <b>630</b> also preferably has a recessed opening or inlet, such as channel <b>631</b> which helps to prevent large obstructions from entering into the emitter <b>620</b> during operation within a fluid-filled drip line.</p>
<p id="p-0119" num="0118">Turning now to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>8</b>A-G</figref>, in which there is illustrated yet another emitter embodying features of the present invention, this emitter defines a series of rows of baffles transverse to the longitudinal axis of the emitter and extending into the pressure reduction flow path, with a portion of the baffles varying in height to create a structure that compensates for pressure. In keeping with the above, items that are similar to those discussed in earlier embodiments will be referenced using the same last two-digit identifier, but using the prefix &#x201c;7&#x201d; to distinguish one embodiment from others. Thus, in the form illustrated, the emitter body is referenced by reference numeral <b>720</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0120" num="0119">In the form illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>8</b>A-G</figref>, the unitary emitter body <b>720</b> is made of an elastomeric material and defines a single pressure reducing flow channel or passage <b>750</b> laid out in a generally serpentine pattern. The body <b>720</b> has a longitudinal axis and defines an inlet <b>730</b> and outlet <b>740</b> in addition to the pressure reduction flow path <b>750</b> which connects both the inlet <b>730</b> and outlet <b>740</b>. The body <b>720</b> has a series of rows of baffles <b>752</b><i>g</i>-<i>m</i>, extending transverse to the longitudinal axis of the emitter <b>720</b> and into the pressure reduction flow path <b>750</b>. A first series of baffles, <b>752</b><i>g</i>, <b>752</b><i>h </i>and <b>752</b><i>i </i>have constant height, whereas, a second series of baffles, <b>752</b><i>j</i>, <b>752</b><i>k</i>, <b>7521</b> and <b>752</b><i>m </i>vary in height. The baffles having a varying height, <b>752</b><i>j</i>-<b>752</b><i>m</i>, have a static or normal position and a pressurized elevated position (or elevated pressure position).</p>
<p id="p-0121" num="0120">In the embodiment depicted, the baffles are shaped in the form of teeth positioned about a wall wherein each varying height baffle tooth has a base <b>752</b><i>n </i>and a distal or terminal end <b>752</b><i>o </i>with the varying height being at a maximum height at the base <b>752</b><i>n </i>and at a minimum height at the distal or terminal end <b>752</b><i>o</i>. The baffle teeth are staggered or positioned to alternate with one another so that the teeth align opposite gaps between teeth members on the opposite wall defining the fluid flow passage <b>750</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0122" num="0121">In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>8</b>A-G</figref>, at least two rows of the series of baffles (e.g., <b>752</b><i>k</i>, <b>752</b><i>l</i>) include varying height teeth members. An additional two rows of the series of baffles (e.g., <b>752</b><i>j</i>, <b>752</b><i>m</i>) include varying height teeth members on one side of the baffle. Baffle row <b>752</b><i>j </i>includes teeth of continuous height extending from one side of the row (e.g., the side facing the inlet <b>730</b>) and teeth of varying height on the opposite side of the row (e.g., the side facing outlet <b>740</b>). Baffle rows <b>752</b><i>h </i>and <b>752</b><i>i </i>having continuous height (including all teeth). Baffle rows <b>752</b><i>g </i>and <b>752</b><i>m </i>have teeth extending from only one side of their respective row, with the baffle row <b>752</b><i>g </i>being of continuous height and baffle row <b>752</b><i>m </i>being of varying height. Thus, with this configuration, the baffles with varying height <b>752</b><i>j</i>-<i>m </i>server as the pressure compensating member <b>760</b> for emitter <b>720</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0123" num="0122">Thus, when a plurality of emitters <b>720</b> are installed in a conduit to form a drip line, fluid will flow through the conduit, into the inlet of the drip emitter <b>720</b> and through pressure reducing flow passage <b>750</b>. As fluid pressure increases in the conduit, the passage floor of passage <b>750</b> will push up into the flow passage <b>750</b> in at least the areas where baffles of varying height are provided (e.g., compensation portion <b>760</b>) due to the spacing that exists and allows for baffle movement. This will cause the baffle teeth to move to their elevated pressure position, preferably forcing their upper surfaces to engage the inside surface of the conduit (or approaching such engagement), thereby, reducing the cross-section of the flow passage <b>750</b> in this area and restricting the amount of fluid that can flow through this region in order to compensate for the fluid pressure increase. In this way, the emitter operates similar to the emitter embodiments discussed above with respect to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>1</b>A-I</figref> and <b>2</b>A-F.</p>
<p id="p-0124" num="0123">Although the embodiment depicted in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>8</b>A-G</figref> shows specific series of baffles having continuous height and varying height, it should be understood that in alternate embodiments, more or less of the baffles <b>752</b><i>g</i>-<i>m </i>may have varying heights. In fact, in some forms, all of the baffles may be provided in constant height (for example, in situations where no pressure compensation feature is required or desired for the emitter). Alternatively, in other embodiments, all of the baffles may have some form of varying height component.</p>
<p id="p-0125" num="0124">In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>8</b>A-G</figref>, the emitter <b>720</b> preferably includes a guide recess, such as channel <b>721</b>, which serves the dual role of helping position or align the emitter <b>720</b> for insertion into the conduit and helps recess the inlet <b>730</b> of emitter <b>720</b> into a recessed opening <b>731</b> which helps block larger obstructions from entering into the emitter <b>720</b> or at least blocking all flow of fluid into the inlet <b>730</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0126" num="0125">The emitter body <b>720</b> further defines an outlet bath <b>740</b> and the pressure reduction flow path <b>750</b> includes an outlet end at the outlet bath. In a preferred form, the unitary emitter body <b>720</b> will include at least one projection <b>741</b> in the outlet bath <b>740</b> to prevent the outlet bath from collapsing under increased fluid pressure. In the form illustrated, a plurality of projections or nubs <b>741</b> extend up from the floor of the outlet <b>740</b> to prevent collapse of the bath <b>740</b>. Additional rectangular notches or voids are illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>8</b>E</figref> which show how the emitter body <b>720</b> may be designed to use less elastomeric material, which not only will have a material cost savings, but also will reduce the amount of time it takes to manufacture the emitter <b>720</b> and may potentially improve the operation of the pressure compensating portion <b>760</b> of the emitter <b>720</b> due to the fact thinner portions of elastomeric material will be more responsive to pressure increases than larger portions of elastomeric material.</p>
<p id="p-0127" num="0126">Turning now to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>9</b>A-B</figref>, there is illustrated yet another emitter embodying features of the present invention wherein a unitary emitter body defines a series of rows of baffles transverse to the longitudinal axis of the emitter and extending into the pressure reduction flow path, and a plurality of outlet baths with at least a portion of outlet baths being moveable between first and second positions, the second position being more constrictive for fluid flow than the first position. In keeping with the above, portions of this embodiment that are similar to those discussed above will use the same last two-digit reference numerals as those discussed above, but using the prefix &#x201c;8&#x201d; simply to distinguish one embodiment from the others. Thus, in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>9</b>A-B</figref>, the emitter body will be referred to as body <b>820</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0128" num="0127">In the form illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>9</b>A-B</figref>, the unitary emitter body <b>820</b> is made of an elastomeric material and has a longitudinal axis. The body <b>820</b> further defines a pressure reduction flow path <b>850</b> and an inlet <b>830</b> to the pressure reduction flow path <b>850</b>. The body <b>820</b> includes a series of rows of baffles <b>852</b><i>g</i>, <b>852</b><i>h</i>, <b>852</b><i>i </i>and <b>852</b><i>j</i>, which are positioned transverse to the longitudinal axis of the emitter <b>820</b> and extend into the pressure reduction flow passage <b>850</b> to form a tortuous passage that is further laid out in a serpentine manner. In addition, however, the emitter body <b>820</b> further defines a plurality of outlet baths. In the form illustrated, the body <b>820</b> defines a first outlet bath <b>842</b>, a second outlet bath <b>843</b> and a third outlet bath <b>844</b>. The pressure reduction flow passage <b>850</b> includes an outlet end that opens to the first outlet bath <b>842</b>, and a first passage <b>845</b> extends between the first and second outlet baths <b>842</b>, <b>843</b>. In a preferred form, at least a portion of the first outlet bath or first passage have a first position and a second position, the second position being more constrictive to fluid flow than the first position.</p>
<p id="p-0129" num="0128">More particularly, in the form shown, first passage <b>845</b> is defined by wall member <b>847</b> and moves between a first non-pressurized position wherein the passage remains in its normal state and the cross-section of the passage <b>845</b> is at its initial size, and a second pressurized position wherein the first passage is elevated or moved toward the inner conduit surface to which the emitter is mounted thereby decreasing the cross-section of the first passage <b>845</b> to form a more constrictive passageway and compensate for the fluid pressure increase experienced by the emitter <b>820</b>. The first passage <b>845</b> is in the shape of a notch, however, it should be understood that various different size notches or grooves could be used as desired while still maintaining the pressure compensation capabilities discussed above. One advantage to smaller configurations, however, is that a small surface area is being used to accomplish the pressure compensation and, thus, the pressure compensation member can be controlled more easily and can be produced in a way that yields more consistent results emitter to emitter.</p>
<p id="p-0130" num="0129">In alternate embodiments, it should be understood that the floor of the first outlet bath <b>842</b> may alternatively be made moveable rather than first passage <b>845</b>. For example, the floor of first outlet bath <b>842</b> may be configured to move between a first non-pressurized position wherein the floor remains in its normal state and the cross-section of the bath opening formed by first bath <b>842</b> is at its initial size, and a second pressurized position wherein at least a portion of the floor is pushed or extended into the first bath <b>842</b> via increased fluid pressure within the conduit to which the emitter <b>820</b> is mounted thereby decreasing the cross-section of the bath opening formed by first bath <b>842</b> to compensate for this fluid pressure increase. In still other embodiments, both the first passage <b>845</b> and first outlet bath <b>842</b> may be moveable between such positions. However, as mentioned above, in a preferred form, only the first passage <b>845</b> will be designed to move in such a way because the movement of such a small surface is easier to control and produce repeatable results from emitter to emitter.</p>
<p id="p-0131" num="0130">Turning back to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>9</b>A-B</figref>, the emitter <b>820</b> further defines a third outlet bath <b>844</b> and a second passage <b>846</b> extending between the second outlet bath <b>843</b> and the third outlet bath <b>844</b>. The second passage <b>846</b> is defined by wall members <b>848</b><i>a</i>, <b>848</b><i>b </i>and differs in shape from that of first passage <b>845</b>. In a preferred form, neither the second outlet bath <b>843</b> nor second passage <b>846</b> are setup to compensate for pressure and fluid flowing through the second outlet bath <b>843</b> is simply allowed to pass through to the third outlet bath <b>844</b>. The conduit to which the emitter <b>820</b> is connected will define an outlet opening like drip line outlet opening <b>71</b> (mentioned with respect to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref> above) and this opening may be positioned above either the second or third outlet baths <b>843</b>, <b>844</b>. In alternate embodiments, it should be understood that if the desired flow rate may be accomplished through the first passage <b>845</b>, the emitter <b>820</b> may be designed with only one additional outlet bath which may either result in combining the second and third outlet baths <b>843</b>, <b>844</b> to provide only a second outlet bath, or result in the manufacturer being able to reduce the size of the emitter to terminate after the second outlet bath <b>843</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0132" num="0131">In yet other embodiments, it should be understood that at least a portion of the second outlet bath <b>843</b> or second passage <b>846</b> may also be configured to move between a third position and a fourth position, the fourth position being more constrictive to fluid flow than the third position in order to further compensate for fluid pressure changes if desired. For example, in the form illustrated, the floor of the second bath <b>843</b> could be made moveable between a third non-pressurized position wherein the floor remains in its normal state and the cross-section of the bath opening formed by second bath <b>843</b> remains at an initial size, and a fourth pressurized position wherein at least a portion of the floor is pushed or extended into the second bath <b>843</b> via increased fluid pressure within the conduit to which the emitter <b>820</b> is mounted thereby decreasing the cross-section of the bath opening formed by second bath <b>844</b> to compensate for this fluid pressure increase. Alternatively, the second passage <b>846</b> between the second and third outlet baths <b>843</b>, <b>844</b>, respectively, could be configured to move so that the cross-section of the passage opening reduces in size when moved from a third position to a fourth position. In still other forms, both the second outlet bath <b>843</b> and second passage <b>846</b> could be configured to move in response to increases in fluid pressure to compensate for same.</p>
<p id="p-0133" num="0132">In yet other embodiments and as mentioned with respect to the first passage <b>845</b> above, the second passage <b>846</b> may be provided in a variety of different shapes and sizes. It is preferred, however, to maintain a smaller size and shape for this passage (if setup to compensate for pressure) so that the passage's operation is easier to control and to reproduce on a repeatable results from emitter to emitter. Alternatively and as mentioned above, no second passage <b>846</b> may be provided as the first outlet bath <b>842</b> may be configured to outlet fluid directly into the second and final outlet bath.</p>
<p id="p-0134" num="0133">Turning back to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>9</b>A-B</figref>, the third outlet bath <b>844</b> is connected to the second outlet bath <b>843</b> via second passage <b>846</b> and further includes projections or nubs <b>841</b> for preventing the third outlet bath <b>844</b> from collapsing in response to fluid pressure increases. As with the embodiment of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>8</b>A-G</figref>, the rows of baffles <b>825</b><i>g</i>-<i>j </i>of emitter <b>820</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>9</b>A-B</figref> are preferably formed with teeth extending from wall members with the teeth being staggered with respect to one another so that the teeth at least partially align with the gaps created between opposing baffle teeth members to form the tortuous pressure reducing flow passage <b>850</b> therebetween. Lastly, the emitter <b>820</b> preferably includes guide recess <b>821</b> for aligning and inserting the emitter <b>820</b> into conduit and for creating a recessed inlet <b>831</b> that is protected from larger obstructions traveling through the conduit in a manner similar to that discussed above in prior embodiments.</p>
<p id="p-0135" num="0134">As mentioned above, in alternate embodiments, other portions of the first, second and third outlet baths <b>842</b>, <b>843</b> and <b>844</b> (including first and second passages <b>845</b> and <b>846</b>) may be configured to move to compensate for fluid pressure changes. In addition, it should be understood that other features of earlier embodiments may be incorporated into the embodiment illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>9</b>A-B</figref> and vice versa. More particularly, any of the above-mentioned features with respect to the various embodiments discussed herein may be combined or mixed and matched with one another to come-up with alternate embodiments intended to be covered herein.</p>
<p id="p-0136" num="0135">An alternate embodiment of an emitter in accordance with aspects of the present invention is illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>10</b>A-E</figref>. In keeping with the above practice, items in this embodiment that are similar to those previously discussed will be referred to using the same two-digit reference numeral but adding the prefix &#x201c;9&#x201d; to distinguish one embodiment from others. Thus, the emitter illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>10</b>A-E</figref> will be referred to generally by reference numeral <b>910</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0137" num="0136">In the embodiment illustrated, emitter <b>910</b> has a single piece or unitary body construction and defines an inlet <b>930</b>, inlet channel <b>931</b>, pressure reducing flow channel <b>950</b>, pressure compensating member or channel <b>960</b> and outlet <b>940</b>. The pressure compensating member <b>960</b> and outlet <b>940</b> essentially form first and second baths <b>942</b>, <b>943</b> divided by first and second wall members <b>947</b><i>a</i>, <b>947</b><i>b </i>with passage <b>945</b> passing therebetween, and a third or final bath <b>944</b> separated from the second bath <b>943</b> via passage <b>946</b>. The emitter <b>910</b> includes an inlet protrusion or projection, such as elongated inlet sleeve <b>932</b>, which extends the inlet opening <b>930</b> more towards the center or middle of the lumen of the tube <b>970</b> into which the emitter <b>910</b> is mounted (see <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>10</b>E</figref>). This allows the inlet <b>930</b> to draw fluid from the center region rather than at a circumferential periphery of the inner lumen of the tube <b>970</b> to which the emitter is mounted. Since larger grit or other particulates or particles found in the fluid traveling through the drip line tube <b>970</b> tend to stay near the inner wall of the tube (near the circumferential periphery), having the sleeve <b>932</b> project the inlet <b>930</b> further into or toward the center of the inner lumen of the tube <b>970</b> helps reduce the potential that grit or other particulates will enter into and/or clog emitter <b>910</b> or prevent it from performing as desired (and particularly the larger pieces which are more likely to cause a problem with the operation of the emitter <b>910</b>).</p>
<p id="p-0138" num="0137">In the form illustrated, the inlet protrusion <b>932</b> forms a sleeve extending out from the emitter body <b>910</b> toward the center of the inner lumen of tube <b>970</b>. The sleeve <b>932</b> has a rounded or beveled distal end and defines an inlet channel opening <b>931</b> that is generally rectangular in cross-section and connects in fluid communication the outermost inlet opening located at the distal end of the inlet sleeve <b>932</b> to the tortuous flow passage <b>950</b> and, in particular, the pressure reducing flow section of the flow channel. The inlet sleeve <b>932</b> extends from the longitudinal center of one end of emitter body <b>920</b>; however, it should be understood that in alternate forms, the inlet sleeve <b>932</b> may extend from another location on the emitter body <b>920</b>, such as from a corner or side of the emitter body (as will be discussed further with respect to the embodiments of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>12</b>A-<b>15</b>B</figref>). It also should be understood that although the inlet sleeve <b>932</b> is illustrated as a generally oval or rounded rectangular sleeve in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>10</b>A-E</figref>, the inlet sleeve <b>932</b> may be provided in a variety of different shapes and sizes (including without limitation length and cross-section). One advantage to the rounded edges of the inlet sleeve <b>932</b>, however, is that it reduces the number of flat surfaces located on the emitter <b>910</b> which are typically prone to collecting grit and other particulates (e.g., grit build-up).</p>
<p id="p-0139" num="0138">In the form illustrated, the emitter body <b>920</b> has a height ranging between one hundred thousandths of an inch (0.100&#x2033;) and one hundred fifty thousandths of an inch (0.150&#x2033;) (see dimension C in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>10</b>E</figref>), a width ranging between two hundred fifty thousandths of an inch (0.250&#x2033;) and four hundred thousandths of an inch (0.400&#x2033;), and a length ranging between eight hundredths of an inch (0.800&#x2033;) and one and five hundred thousandths of an inch (1.500&#x2033;). The emitter body <b>920</b> will be inserted into conventional drip tubing sizes, which vary not only in outer diameter (&#x201c;OD&#x201d;) sizes (e.g., &#xbc;&#x2033;, &#xbd;&#x2033;, &#xbe;&#x2033;, 1&#x2033;, 1.5&#x2033;, etc.), but also vary in inner diameter (&#x201c;ID&#x201d;) sizes due to differences in tube wall thicknesses. Thus, in a preferred form, the height of the inlet sleeve <b>932</b> (see dimension B in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>10</b>E</figref>) will be such that the opening of inlet <b>930</b> is positioned between twenty and fifty percent (20-50%) of the ID of the tubing <b>970</b>. The following chart provides some exemplary height ranges for the extended inlet sleeve <b>932</b> at some of the more conventional ID tube sizes:</p>

<p id="p-0141" num="0139">Although the chart indicates a height ranging between one hundred and two thousandths of an inch (0.102&#x2033;) and three hundred ninety-four thousandths of an inch (0.394&#x2033;), it should be understood that tubing of varying sizes can be used, and thus, the actual height of inlet sleeve <b>932</b> may be above or below this range. In a preferred form, inlet sleeve <b>932</b> will be configured to be one half to one times (&#xbd;&#xd7; to 1&#xd7;) the height of the emitter body <b>920</b> (see dimension C in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>10</b>E</figref>). Thus, using the height range specified above, this would give a sleeve height (see dimension B in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>10</b>E</figref>) of between fifty thousandths of an inch (0.050&#x2033;) and two hundred and twenty five thousandths of an inch (0.225&#x2033;). If it is desirable to keep the size of the emitter <b>910</b> down to a minimum, sticking closer to a sleeve <b>932</b> that is one half times (&#xbd;&#xd7;) the size of the height of the emitter body <b>920</b> will be preferred.</p>
<p id="p-0142" num="0140">The emitter <b>910</b> illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>10</b>A-E</figref> further includes a different flow passage configuration and, specifically, a different pattern or layout to the pressure reduction portion of the flow passage and a different layout or orientation to the pressure compensation portion of the flow passage. More particularly, in the form illustrated, the pressure reduction portion of the flow path is a much more condensed serpentine pattern due to the smaller size of emitter <b>910</b> (e.g., emitter <b>910</b> is approximately one third (&#x2153;<sup>rd</sup>) the size of the embodiments discussed previously), and the pressure compensation portion <b>960</b> includes a different orientation but yet still includes two opposing wall members <b>947</b><i>a</i>, <b>947</b><i>b </i>that tapper toward one another to form angled teeth or a notch that can be moved between low fluid pressure positions wherein maximum gaps are provided between upper surfaces of the wall members <b>947</b><i>a</i>, <b>947</b><i>b </i>and the surrounding inner surface of the tube <b>970</b> within which the emitter is mounted and high fluid pressure positions wherein the gaps between the upper surfaces of wall members <b>947</b><i>a</i>, <b>947</b><i>b </i>and the inner surface of tube <b>970</b> are at their minimum (possibly even having no gap). The movement of the wall members <b>947</b><i>a</i>, <b>947</b><i>b </i>is achieved via movement of the floor of the emitter proximate the wall members <b>947</b><i>a</i>, <b>947</b><i>b</i>. Thus, when fluid pressure increases within the inner lumen of tube <b>970</b>, the floor of the emitter <b>910</b> and associated wall members <b>947</b><i>a</i>, <b>947</b><i>b </i>are moved toward the inner surface of the tube <b>970</b> thereby causing the cross sectional area of the flow passage through the emitter to be reduced at passage <b>945</b> to create a pressure drop from bath <b>942</b> to bath <b>943</b> to account for the increase in fluid pressure. This regulation causes the emitter <b>910</b> to drip fluid at a generally constant flow rate.</p>
<p id="p-0143" num="0141">In the form illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>10</b>A-E</figref>, a recess is formed in the backside (i.e., bottom or rear) of the emitter <b>910</b> below the pressure compensation portion <b>960</b> in order to thin the floor <b>961</b> to make it more responsive to increases in pressure for the fluid traveling through the inner lumen of tube <b>970</b>. This recess gives the floor <b>961</b> a trampoline type effect or action and allows wall members <b>947</b><i>a</i>, <b>947</b><i>b </i>to be moved more easily between their low fluid pressure and high fluid pressure positions, similar to the moveable wall members discussed above with respect to prior embodiments. The recess extends beyond the moveable wall portion (i.e., the moveable notch or teeth portion or flipper teeth portion) of the flow path and into at least a part of the fixed tooth portion of the flow path. This configuration could be used in order to allow the floor <b>961</b> of that part of the fixed teeth portion to move in response to increases and decreases in fluid pressure in tube or line <b>970</b> to further help the emitter <b>910</b> compensate for such changes in the system. Thus, this portion of the fixed height section of the flow path may provide both pressure reduction and pressure compensation if desired. In alternate forms, however, the thinning of the floor of the fixed teeth portion will be designed not to move in such a manner despite the presence of such a recess in which case the fixed portion will only pressure reduction. It should be understood that in alternate embodiments of the invention recesses of different sizes and shapes may be used to create trampoline areas of different size and shape to achieve the desired pressure compensation effect (including without limitation those discussed in the embodiments that follow).</p>
<p id="p-0144" num="0142">In a preferred form, the emitter <b>910</b> is made of any material capable of allowing for the upper surfaces of wall members <b>947</b><i>a</i>, <b>947</b><i>b </i>to be moved up toward the inner surface of tube <b>970</b> in order to reduce the cross-section of the flow channel and compensate for increased fluid pressure within tube <b>970</b>. For example, the emitter <b>910</b> may be made of TPO having a Durometer reading ranging between 25 and 100 (preferably being between 50 and 75) and allowing the pressure compensation portion <b>960</b> to move between five thousandths of an inch (0.005&#x2033;) and thirty thousandths of an inch (0.030&#x2033;) and preferably between eight thousandths of an inch (0.008&#x2033;) and twenty-two thousandths of an inch (0.022&#x2033;).</p>
<p id="p-0145" num="0143">As mentioned above, the emitter illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>10</b>A-E</figref> is approximately one third (&#x2153;&#x2032;) the size of the emitters illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>1</b>A-<b>9</b>B</figref>. This size still allows the emitter to operate within desired pressure compensation parameters, but saves a significant amount in material costs. In alternate forms, the emitter of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>10</b>A-E</figref> may be configured so that it is slightly larger and approximately half (&#xbd;) the size of the emitters illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>1</b>A-<b>9</b>B</figref>. For example, this may be done in order to increase the size of the trampoline area or pressure compensation area <b>960</b> of the emitter <b>910</b> in order to improve the pressure compensation performance of the emitter.</p>
<p id="p-0146" num="0144">In the form illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>10</b>A-E</figref>, the trampoline area or pressure compensation area of the emitter makes-up one third (&#x2153;rd) to one half (&#xbd;) of the overall emitter. In alternate forms, the pressure compensation portion of the emitter may make-up more or less of the overall emitter. For example, in a preferred form, the outlet bath would make-up one third (&#x2153;rd) of the emitter and the pressure compensation portion would make-up the remaining two-thirds (&#x2154;rds) of the emitter (meaning there is no pressure reducing portion for grit to get stuck in or clog). Alternatively, a pressure reduction portion could be added and, if desired, the recess could be extended under the entire pressure reduction portion or fixed teeth portion of the flow passage so that the entire flow path or passage provides pressure compensation. If an emitter with only a pressure compensation portion and outlet bath cannot be used (i.e., one without a pressure reduction portion), in a preferred form, the pressure reduction portion will be one to one and a half times (1&#xd7; to 1.5&#xd7;) the size or area of the pressure compensation portion in order to provide a desired pressure drop to the fluid passing through the emitter <b>910</b>. In other forms, the pressure reduction portion <b>950</b> may be incorporated into the inlet sleeve <b>932</b> and the remaining portion of the flow passage extending between the inlet sleeve <b>932</b> and the outlet bath <b>940</b> may be configured to be pressure compensating only.</p>
<p id="p-0147" num="0145">In the specific embodiment illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>10</b>A-E</figref>, the pressure compensation portion of the flow passage has a width ranging between two hundred fifty thousandths of an inch (0.250&#x2033;) and three hundred seventy-five thousandths of an inch (0.375&#x2033;) and a length ranging between one hundred twenty-five thousandths of an inch (0.125&#x2033;) and three hundred seventy-five thousandths of an inch (0.375&#x2033;). The height (or depth) of the pressure compensation flow path ranges between twenty thousandths of an inch (0.020&#x2033;) and thirty thousandths of an inch (0.030&#x2033;), with the overall height of the emitter again ranging between one hundred thousandths of an inch (0.100&#x2033;) and one hundred fifty thousandths of an inch (0.150&#x2033;).</p>
<p id="p-0148" num="0146">The emitter <b>910</b> also includes a root growth inhibiting member, such as copper insert or body <b>980</b>, which is positioned proximate to the outlet bath <b>940</b> to reduce the risk of roots growing into the outlet <b>940</b> of the emitter <b>910</b>. In the form illustrated, the copper insert <b>980</b> corresponds in shape to the shape of outlet bath <b>940</b> and is, preferably, connected to the floor of the outlet bath <b>940</b> so that it cannot shift and block flow of fluid through the emitter <b>910</b> and out of the outlet <b>940</b>. In one form, the copper insert <b>980</b> is formed as a plate that is fixed to the bottom of outlet bath <b>940</b> via an adhesive. It should be understood, however, that in alternate embodiments, the copper insert <b>980</b> may take a variety of different shapes and sizes and may be connected or affixed to the emitter in a variety of different ways. For example, with respect to size and shape, in alternate forms, the copper insert <b>980</b> may be shaped to fit in only a portion of the outlet bath <b>940</b> (e.g., filling only a single finger of the outlet bath <b>940</b> rather than all four fingers illustrated) or in passage <b>946</b>. In a preferred form, the outlet <b>940</b> of the emitter <b>910</b> will take up no more than one third (&#x2153;<sup>rd</sup>) of the emitter's total size, thus, the copper insert <b>980</b> will preferably have a size that is less than one third (&#x2153;<sup>rd</sup>) the overall emitter size.</p>
<p id="p-0149" num="0147">With respect to securing the copper insert <b>980</b> to emitter <b>910</b>, in alternate forms, the insert <b>980</b> may be secured to the emitter <b>910</b> via alternate forms of fastening (heat stake, rivet, screw, pin, mating or interlocking structures (e.g., tongue and groove configuration, ball and/or detent, mortise and tenon, etc.), friction or press fitting, etc.). For example, the side wall of the outlet bath <b>940</b> may be designed with a lip or projection that the copper insert gets pushed past during installation in order to secure the copper insert <b>980</b> in position or prevent the insert <b>980</b> from interfering with the flow of fluid through the emitter <b>910</b> while generally maintaining the insert <b>980</b> in a desired location or position. In such a form, the lip may be located in a single spot on a side wall of the outlet bath <b>940</b>. Alternatively, the lip may comprise multiple lips extending out from one or more side walls of the outlet bath <b>940</b>. In still other forms, the lip may comprise a continuous lip extending around the entire outlet bath <b>940</b> or all side walls of the outlet bath <b>940</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0150" num="0148">In the form illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>10</b>A-E</figref>, the emitter <b>910</b> may be provided in a plurality of different flow rates (e.g., 1 GPH, 2 GPH, 4 GPH, etc.). The emitter <b>910</b> may be altered in a variety of different ways to control flow rate of the emitter. For example and without limitation, the gap between moveable wall members may be adjusted to achieve different flow rates, the cross-sectional area of the flow passage of the emitter may be altered, and the number of fixed or moveable teeth can be adjusted to achieve different flow rates. In one form, the gap between the moveable wall members <b>947</b><i>a</i>, <b>947</b><i>b </i>(illustrated as passage <b>945</b>) may be widened or narrowed in order to change the cross-sectional area of the flow passage to provide emitters of differing flow rates. For example, the gap between wall members <b>947</b><i>a</i>, <b>947</b><i>b </i>can be widened to allow more fluid to flow through the emitter to provide an emitter with a higher GPH flow rate. Conversely, the gap between wall members <b>947</b><i>a</i>, <b>947</b><i>b </i>can be narrowed in order to let less fluid flow through the emitter to provide an emitter with a lower GPH flow rate.</p>
<p id="p-0151" num="0149">In another form, the cross-sectional area of other portions of the flow passage may be changed to provide emitters with different flow rates. For example, the floor or depth of the flow passage (either in the pressure reduction portion or the pressure compensation portion, or both) may be lowered to create a passage with a larger cross-sectional area that allows more fluid to flow through the emitter, thereby providing an emitter with a higher flow rate. Conversely, the floor of the flow passage may be raised to reduce the cross-sectional area of the flow passage so that less fluid can flow through the emitter, thereby reducing the flow rate of the emitter.</p>
<p id="p-0152" num="0150">In still other forms, the number of teeth can be adjusted for the flow passage to provide emitters with different flow rates. For example, in one form, the number of fixed teeth (i.e., fixed-height teeth or non-moving teeth) may be increased to achieve a more tortuous path for additional pressure reduction and, thus, lower flow rate. Conversely, the number of fixed teeth can be reduced to achieve a less tortuous path for less pressure reduction and, thus, a higher flow rate. Alternatively, the number of moveable teeth (e.g., wall members <b>947</b><i>a</i>, <b>947</b><i>b</i>) may be increased or decreased to achieve more or less constrictions to produce greater or less pressure compensation, respectively, for achieving different flow rates.</p>
<p id="p-0153" num="0151">In still other forms, the height of the moveable teeth may be adjusted to provide emitters with different flow rates. For example, moveable teeth having greater height may be used to reduce the amount of pressure required in order to saturate the pressure compensation section of the flow passage. Conversely, moveable teeth having less height may be used to increase the amount of fluid pressure the emitter can account for before reaching its saturation point.</p>
<p id="p-0154" num="0152">In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>11</b>A-E</figref>, an alternate form of emitter is illustrated having moveable teeth that can be adjusted to provide emitters with different flow rates as discussed above. In keeping with the above practices, items associate with this emitter that are similar to those discussed above will use the same two digit reference numeral but having the prefix &#x201c;10&#x201d; added to distinguish one embodiment from the others. Thus, in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>11</b>A-E</figref>, the emitter is referenced as emitter <b>1010</b> and includes a single piece or unitary emitter body <b>1020</b> defining an inlet <b>1030</b> and outlet <b>1040</b>. Like the embodiment of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>10</b>A-E</figref>, the emitter <b>1010</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>11</b>A-E</figref> includes an elongated inlet protrusion, such as sleeve <b>1032</b>, which is centrally located on one end of the emitter body <b>1020</b> and allows the emitter <b>1010</b> to draw fluid from the tube within which it is installed from a region closer to the center of the inner lumen of the tube and away from where larger pieces of grit or particles collect along the inner wall of the tube. The inlet sleeve <b>1032</b> preferably includes rounded edges to reduce the number of flat surfaces located on the emitter where grit build-up can occur. The emitter <b>1010</b> also includes outlet walls <b>1041</b><i>a</i>, <b>1041</b><i>b</i>, <b>1041</b><i>c</i>, which support the outlet bath <b>1040</b> and prevent the floor of the outlet bath <b>1040</b> from collapsing toward the adjacent inner surface of the tube as fluid pressure increases within the supply line or tube. A root growth inhibiting member, such as copper insert <b>1080</b> is also present in the outlet bath <b>1040</b> to hinder roots from obstructing the operation of the emitter <b>1010</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0155" num="0153">Unlike the embodiment of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>10</b>A-E</figref>, however, the embodiment of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>11</b>A-E</figref> includes a plurality of moving teeth <b>1062</b> staggered apart from and opposing one another in the pressure compensation section <b>1060</b> of the emitter <b>1010</b>. The emitter <b>1010</b> has a notch or recess formed on the backside forming the trampoline area of the emitter so that the floor <b>1061</b> of the flow path can move the moveable teeth <b>1062</b> between their low pressure position wherein the upper surfaces of the moveable teeth are spaced apart from the inner surface of the tube or drip line within which the emitter is installed and their high pressure position where the floor <b>1061</b> pushes the teeth up toward the inner surface of the tube until the upper surfaces of the moveable teeth <b>1062</b> engage the inner surface of the tube. The movement of the moveable teeth or flippers <b>1062</b> into their high pressure position reduces the cross-sectional area of the flow passage so that less fluid can travel through the emitter <b>1010</b> as a means for compensating for increased line pressure within the tube and to keep the flow rate of fluid through the emitter <b>1010</b> relatively constant.</p>
<p id="p-0156" num="0154">The dimensions specified for the emitter of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>10</b>A-E</figref> apply equally well for the emitter of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>11</b>A-E</figref>, and it should be understood that the alternate embodiments discussed with respect to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>10</b>A-E</figref> equally apply for the embodiment of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>11</b>A-E</figref>, as well. For example, in alternate forms, the height of inlet sleeve <b>1032</b> may be adjusted as needed to get the emitter to draw fluid more from the center region of the tube. In addition, the emitter could be configured with a pressure reduction flow passage only rather than both a pressure reduction portion and a pressure compensation portion. In still other forms, the pressure reduction portion could be incorporated into the inlet sleeve <b>1032</b> with the remainder of the flow passage between the sleeve <b>1032</b> and the outlet bath <b>1040</b> being pressure compensating.</p>
<p id="p-0157" num="0155">Similarly, it should be understood that the alternate ways for providing emitters of varying flow rate equally apply to the embodiment of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>11</b>A-E</figref>. For example, the depth of the flow passage or a portion of the flow passage could be adjusted to provide emitters of varying flow rates (e.g., 1 GPH, 2 GPH, 4 GPH, etc.). Alternatively, the height or number of the teeth members (either the fixed or the moveable) can be adjusted to provide emitters of varying flow rates. In still other forms, the gap or spacing between the teeth members may be adjusted to provide emitters of varying flow rates.</p>
<p id="p-0158" num="0156">Another emitter embodiment in accordance with the invention is disclosed in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>12</b>A-B</figref>. In keeping with the above practice, items with respect to this emitter that are similar to those discussed in the embodiments above will use the same two-digit reference numeral but add the prefix &#x201c;11&#x201d; to distinguish one embodiment from another. Thus, in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>12</b>A-B</figref>, the emitter is referenced by reference numeral <b>1110</b> and comprises a unitary body <b>1120</b> that defines an inlet opening <b>1130</b>, flow passage and outlet bath <b>1140</b>. Like the embodiments of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>10</b>A-<b>11</b>E</figref>, the emitter <b>1110</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>12</b>A-B</figref> includes an elongated inlet <b>1032</b>, outlet bath walls <b>1141</b><i>a</i>, <b>1141</b><i>b </i>and <b>1141</b><i>c</i>, and a root growth inhibiting member, such as copper insert <b>1180</b> (shown exploded from the emitter body for purposes of illustrating its presence). Unlike the embodiments of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>10</b>A-<b>11</b>E</figref>, however, the emitter <b>1110</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>12</b>A-B</figref> has an elongated inlet sleeve <b>1032</b> that is positioned at a corner of the emitter body <b>1120</b> rather than centrally located on the end of the emitter. This configuration allows the length of the pressure reduction portion <b>1250</b> of the tortuous flow passage to be maximized as it starts from the corner of the emitter body <b>1220</b>, rather than in the middle of the body <b>1220</b>, as is done in the emitter of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>10</b>A-<b>11</b>E</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0159" num="0157">Emitter <b>1110</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>12</b>A-B</figref> further includes a different configuration or layout to the pressure compensation portion <b>160</b> of the emitter <b>1110</b>. Specifically, the emitter uses first and second moveable wall members <b>1147</b><i>a</i>, <b>1147</b><i>b</i>, respectively, to compensate for increase in fluid line pressure. When in the low pressure position (illustrated), the walls <b>1147</b><i>a</i>, <b>1147</b><i>b </i>and floor <b>1161</b> remain in their static state and allow fluid to flow over the top surfaces of walls <b>1147</b><i>a</i>, <b>1147</b><i>b</i>. However, when fluid line pressure builds, the floor or trampoline area <b>1161</b> of pressure compensating portion <b>1160</b> moves upward toward the inner surface of the tube to which the emitter is mounted until the upper surfaces of walls <b>1147</b><i>a</i>, <b>1147</b><i>b </i>seal against the inner surface of the tube (or approach this point), which reduces the cross-sectional area of the passage <b>1145</b> through which the fluid passes and thereby compensates for the increase in fluid line pressure.</p>
<p id="p-0160" num="0158">As previously mentioned, the alternative embodiments covered above apply equally to the embodiment of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>12</b>A-B</figref>. For example, although the copper insert <b>1180</b> is adhered to the floor of the emitter outlet bath <b>1140</b>, it should be understood that in alternative embodiments the insert <b>1180</b> could be connected to the emitter in a variety of different ways (e.g., heat stake, rivet, screw, pin, mating or interlocking structures (e.g., tongue and groove configuration, ball and/or detent, mortise and tenon, etc.), friction or press fitting, etc.). Similarly, the dimensions of the emitter <b>1110</b> or any of its parts could be altered as discussed above in order to cater to a particular application.</p>
<p id="p-0161" num="0159">Yet another form of emitter in accordance with the invention is illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>13</b>A-B</figref>. In keeping with the above, items that are similar to those discussed above will be numbered using the same later two digit reference numeral but adding a prefix &#x201c;12&#x201d; to distinguish one embodiment from the others. In the form illustrated, the emitter <b>1210</b> includes a single piece body <b>1220</b> defining an inlet opening <b>1232</b>, flow path and outlet <b>1240</b>. The emitter further includes an inlet protrusion, such as sleeve <b>1232</b>, which extends from a corner of the emitter body to maximize the length of the tortuous flow passage <b>1250</b>. A pressure compensation configuration <b>1260</b> similar to that described with respect to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>12</b>A-B</figref> is also disclosed in which moveable walls <b>1247</b><i>a</i>, <b>1248</b><i>b </i>are allowed to move from a low pressure position to a high pressure position in response to increased line pressure to help compensate for the increase in pressure.</p>
<p id="p-0162" num="0160">Unlike the prior embodiments of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>10</b>A-<b>12</b>B</figref>, however, emitter <b>1210</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>13</b>A-B</figref> includes a filter in the distal end of the inlet sleeve <b>1232</b> to block relatively large particles (e.g., grit, particulates, etc.). Specifically, the distal end of sleeve <b>1232</b> includes a plurality of slots, such as filter channels <b>1232</b><i>a</i>, <b>1232</b><i>b</i>, <b>1232</b><i>c</i>, <b>1232</b><i>d</i>, <b>1232</b><i>e </i>and <b>1232</b><i>f </i>that are used to help block larger particles of debris or grit from entering into the inlet channel <b>1231</b> of emitter <b>1210</b>. The network of channels <b>1232</b><i>a</i>-<i>f </i>further reduces the likelihood that a piece of debris or build-up of debris could block all fluid from flowing through the emitter <b>1210</b>. Rather, such large objects would likely be blocked by the outermost surfaces of the inlet sleeve <b>1232</b>, while fluid is allowed to work its way through the channels <b>1232</b><i>a</i>-<i>f </i>and continue to flow through emitter <b>1210</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0163" num="0161">The emitter <b>1210</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>13</b>A-B</figref> further includes projections or nubs, such as posts <b>1241</b>, in the outlet bath <b>1240</b> instead of walls (like those shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>10</b>A-<b>12</b>B</figref>). The posts <b>1241</b> prevent the floor of the outlet bath <b>1240</b> from collapsing in toward the inner surface of the tube in which the emitter is mounted when line pressure increases in the tube so that the emitter continues to allow fluid to flow through the emitter as desired. In view of this configuration, the shape of the root growth inhibiting member (e.g., copper insert <b>1280</b>) is also changed to mate with the posts <b>1241</b>. Specifically, the insert <b>1280</b> defines a plurality of mating openings that correspond to the location of posts <b>1241</b> so that the insert <b>1280</b> can be positioned within the outlet bath <b>1240</b> of the emitter <b>1210</b>. In a preferred form, the posts <b>1241</b> and openings in insert <b>1280</b> are configured to allow the insert <b>1280</b> to rest flush against the floor of the outlet bath <b>1240</b> so that the insert <b>1280</b> can be adhered to the floor of the outlet bath <b>1240</b>. This may require the insert <b>1280</b> to have a slight bend that tracks the curvature of the floor of the outlet bath <b>1240</b> (if any). However, in alternate embodiments, the posts <b>1241</b> and openings in insert <b>1280</b> could be configured to engage one another in a friction fit so that no adhesive is necessary. This configuration also could allow the plate to be held at a different position with respect to the posts <b>1241</b> instead of adjacent to the floor of outlet bath <b>1240</b> (although such a position is possible with this configuration as well). For example, it may be deemed desirable to position the plate <b>1280</b> closer to the outlet opening in the tubing to which the emitter body <b>1220</b> is mounted. In such a case, the size of the openings in the insert <b>1280</b> could be made so that the insert <b>1280</b> rests near the top of the posts <b>1240</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0164" num="0162">As mentioned above, the various alternative embodiments discussed with each embodiment are equally applicable to other embodiments, including without limitation the embodiment of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>13</b>A-B</figref>. For example, in alternate forms, the insert <b>1280</b> does not have to fill the entire outlet bath <b>1240</b>, but rather, could be a narrower plate that covers a smaller portion of the outlet bath <b>1240</b>. In one form, the insert <b>1280</b> may take the form of a narrow plate that only has openings for one post <b>1241</b> or one row of posts. In another form, the insert <b>1280</b> may be configured with a different shape if desired (e.g., a triangular shape, various polygonal shapes, round or curved shapes, symmetrical shapes, asymmetrical shapes, non-planar shapes, etc.). For example, in one form, the insert <b>1280</b> may be configured to have a non-planar shape wherein the insert <b>1280</b> has a chimney portion that extends up from a planar portion to create a bulge in the tube once the emitter is mounted into the tubing which can then be used to locate and cut open the outlet in the tube to complete manufacturing process and provide a finished emitter and/or drip line. With this configuration the chimney of the copper insert <b>1280</b> would extend up into the tube outlet opening like a sleeve to further deter roots from growing toward or near this portion of the emitter and/or tubing. In still other forms, the insert <b>1280</b> may start out as one shape but be altered during the manufacturing process. For example, the insert <b>1280</b> may start out as a planar plate, but when the outlet opening is punched through the tube wall proximate the outlet bath <b>1240</b>, the plate also may be punched down into the floor of the outlet bath <b>1240</b> leaving a dent in the insert <b>1280</b>. This may help friction fit the insert <b>1280</b> to the emitter <b>1210</b> and/or may punch a portion of the insert <b>1280</b> partially into the floor of the emitter bath <b>1240</b> (but not through) in order to fasten the insert <b>1280</b> to the emitter <b>1210</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0165" num="0163">Another difference between the embodiment of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>13</b>A-B</figref> and the prior embodiments of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>10</b>A-<b>12</b>B</figref> is that the recess on the backside of the emitter that defines the trampoline area of the pressure compensation portion <b>1260</b> is smaller in size and shape and restricted to the pressure compensation portion <b>1260</b>, rather than extending further under the tortuous passage of the pressure reduction portion <b>1250</b>. This smaller trampoline area of pressure compensation portion <b>1260</b> is designed to make the emitter <b>1210</b> less responsive to supply line pressure increases. Specifically, the smaller area of the recess or trampoline area of the pressure compensation portion <b>1260</b> reduces the amount of movement floor <b>1261</b> will have and/or requires greater pressure to move wall members <b>1247</b><i>a</i>, <b>1247</b><i>b </i>to seal against the inner surface of the tube.</p>
<p id="p-0166" num="0164">Another exemplary emitter is illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>14</b>A-B</figref>. In keeping with the above, items that are similar to those discussed above with respect to prior embodiments will be marked designated with the same latter two-digit reference numeral but include the prefix &#x201c;13&#x201d; to distinguish one embodiment from another. Thus, in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>14</b>A-B</figref>, the emitter is designated as emitter <b>1310</b> and includes a body <b>1320</b> that defines and inlet <b>1330</b>, an outlet <b>1340</b> and a tortuous passage connecting the inlet <b>1330</b> and outlet <b>1340</b>. Like the embodiment of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>13</b>A-B</figref>, emitter <b>1310</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>14</b>A-B</figref> has an off-center inlet <b>1330</b> that extends down from the corner of the emitter body <b>1320</b> thereby allowing the length of the pressure reduction flow passage <b>1350</b> to be maximized. The emitter <b>1310</b> also includes an inlet projection, such as sleeve <b>1332</b>, with an integral filter in the form of filter channels <b>1332</b><i>a</i>, <b>1332</b><i>b</i>, <b>1332</b><i>c</i>, <b>1332</b><i>d</i>, <b>13332</b><i>e </i>and <b>1332</b><i>f</i>, which allows the emitter to draw fluid from closer to the center or center region of the inner lumen of the tube in which the emitter is mounted and filter out relatively larger grit particles from entering the emitter <b>1310</b>. The emitter further includes a smaller pressure compensation portion <b>1360</b> and a root growth inhibitor member in the form of copper insert <b>1380</b> which is positioned on outlet projections or nubs <b>1341</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0167" num="0165">Unlike the embodiment of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>13</b>A-B</figref>, however, the emitter <b>1310</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>14</b>A-B</figref> includes a plurality of moveable teeth or flippers <b>1352</b> that move between a low fluid pressure position wherein the upper surfaces of the flippers are spaced apart from the inner surface of the tube in which the emitter <b>1310</b> is mounted and a high fluid pressure position wherein the upper surfaces of the flippers are moved toward the inner surface of the tube to reduce the cross-sectional area of the flow passage <b>1360</b> in response to increased fluid pressure in order to make the emitter <b>1310</b> pressure compensating. In the form illustrated, the flippers are generally triangular in shape and taper from a taller end <b>1352</b><i>n </i>to a shorter distal end <b>1352</b><i>o</i>. As best illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>14</b>B</figref>, the smaller size of the trampoline area <b>1360</b> for the emitter <b>1310</b> means that a greater amount of fluid pressure will be required in order to move the flippers between their low and high fluid pressure positions. In an alternate form, the trampoline area <b>1360</b> may be expanded like that shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>10</b>A-<b>12</b>B</figref>, in order to make the pressure compensating trampoline area easier to move and, thus, more responsive to increases and decreases in fluid pressure. More particularly, the size of the trampoline area on one side of the emitter (e.g., see trampoline <b>1360</b> on <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>14</b>B</figref>) may be made larger than the pressure compensating portion on the other side of the emitter (e.g., see moveable teeth of flippers <b>1360</b> on <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>14</b>A</figref>) in order to make the emitter more responsive to fluid pressure increases or decreases. This increase in trampoline area <b>1360</b> may further be designed to convert a portion of the pressure reduction flow channel <b>1350</b> into part of the pressure compensating member <b>1360</b> (e.g., by allowing the floor of the pressure reduction flow channel to move in response to fluid pressure increases and decreases), but does not have to if it is desired to keep the pressure reduction flow channel <b>1350</b> separate and apart from the pressure compensation portion <b>1360</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0168" num="0166">As mentioned above, it should be understood that features of any of the above-mentioned embodiments may be incorporated into the emitter <b>1310</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>14</b>A-B</figref> if desired. For example, outlet bath walls could be used in lieu of or in addition to post members <b>1341</b>. Similarly, alternate flow channel patterns and orientations may be used. The size of the emitter <b>1310</b> also may be adjusted within the range specified above.</p>
<p id="p-0169" num="0167">Another emitter embodiment is illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>15</b>A-B</figref>. In keeping with the above practice, features of this embodiment that are similar to those discussed above will use the same latter two-digit reference numeral but include the prefix &#x201c;14&#x201d; in order to distinguish one embodiment from the others. Thus, the emitter will be referenced using reference numeral <b>1410</b> for convenience.</p>
<p id="p-0170" num="0168">In the form illustrated, emitter <b>1410</b> has a larger shape more akin to the embodiments of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>1</b>A-<b>9</b>B</figref>. Unlike those prior embodiments, however, emitter <b>1410</b> includes a smaller inlet channel or raceway <b>1431</b> that is positioned in one end or half of the emitter rather than circumnavigating the entire periphery of the emitter. In addition, the emitter <b>1410</b> includes a root growth inhibitor member, such as copper insert <b>1480</b>, and defines a smaller pressure compensation or trampoline area <b>1460</b>. In the form illustrated, the copper insert <b>1480</b> forms a plate with openings corresponding to the post members <b>1441</b> of outlet bath <b>1440</b> so that the plate <b>1480</b> can be disposed in the outlet bath <b>1440</b> proximate the emitter outlet opening of the tube in which the emitter <b>1410</b> is mounted or affixed.</p>
<p id="p-0171" num="0169">The pressure compensating portion <b>1460</b> of emitter <b>1410</b> includes a plurality of moveable teeth or flippers that are orientated such that they continue the serpentine pattern of the pressure reduction flow passage <b>1450</b>. The teeth move between a low fluid pressure position (shown) wherein the upper surfaces of the teeth are spaced apart from the inner surface of the tube within which the emitter <b>1410</b> is mounted and a high fluid pressure position wherein the upper surfaces of the teeth are moved toward, if not into engagement with, the inner surface of the tube within which the emitter is mounted in order to reduce the cross-sectional area of the flow passage to compensate for increases in fluid pressure.</p>
<p id="p-0172" num="0170">Another exemplary embodiment in accordance with the invention disclosed herein is illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>16</b>A-B</figref>. In keeping with above practice, items of this embodiment that are similar to those discussed above will use the same latter two-digit reference numeral but include the prefix &#x201c;15&#x201d; to distinguish one embodiment from others. Thus, the emitter of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>16</b>A-B</figref> will be referred to generally as emitter <b>1510</b>. In the form illustrated, the emitter <b>1510</b> includes a unitary emitter body <b>1520</b> defining an inlet <b>1530</b>, outlet <b>1540</b> and tortuous flow passage connecting the inlet <b>1530</b> and outlet <b>1540</b>. In addition, the emitter <b>1510</b> further includes a carrier <b>1590</b> connected to at least a portion of the emitter body <b>1520</b> to assist with the insertion of the emitter <b>1510</b> into tubing or line to form a finished drip line. For example, the elastomeric material of emitter body <b>1520</b> can increase the amount of friction that exists between the emitter body <b>1520</b> and the insertion equipment used to install the emitter body <b>1520</b> into tubing. Such an increase in friction can lead to the binding-up of the insertion equipment and can ultimately cause the process to be stopped while the insertion equipment and emitters are cleared of obstructions and/or reorganized for proper insertion. To prevent this, the carrier <b>1590</b> may be used to smoothly guide the emitter body <b>1520</b> through the insertion tool and into tubing to form a finished emitter and drip line product.</p>
<p id="p-0173" num="0171">In the form illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>16</b>A-B</figref>, the carrier forms a skirt member that covers at least a portion of the lower and side surfaces of the emitter body <b>1520</b> as these are the surfaces used by the insertion tool to place the emitter into tubing. In the form illustrated, the carrier <b>1590</b> forms a generally rectangular skirt member that has vertical and horizontal wall portions <b>1590</b><i>a</i>, <b>1590</b><i>b </i>(respectively) and defines a large rectangular opening in the middle of the carrier to provide fluid access to the bottom surface of emitter body <b>1520</b>. The vertical wall member allows the carrier <b>1590</b> to form a recess or cup for nesting at least a portion of the emitter body <b>1520</b> in and helps prevent lateral movement of the emitter body <b>1520</b> along the x and y axes in the carrier <b>1590</b>. In a preferred form, the carrier <b>1590</b> is connected or fastened to the emitter body <b>1520</b> to further assist in preventing longitudinal movement of the emitter body <b>1520</b> along the z axis in the carrier <b>1590</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0174" num="0172">In the form illustrated, the carrier <b>1590</b> is made of a polyethylene and the emitter body <b>1520</b> is made of a thermoplastic or thermosetting elastomeric (e.g., TPO) and the carrier <b>1590</b> is connected or fastened to the emitter body <b>1520</b> via an adhesive. It should be understood, however, that in alternate embodiments the carrier <b>1590</b> and emitter body <b>1520</b> may be connected in a variety of different ways including without limitation, heat staking, thermal bonding, friction fit, mating structures (such as ball and detent, tongue and groove, mortise and tenon, etc.), set screws, etc. or using the shape of either of the structures themselves (e.g., as will be discussed further with respect to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>17</b>A-B</figref> below). In a preferred form, the elastomeric emitter <b>1520</b> and carrier <b>1590</b> will be formed in a two-step molding process with either the body <b>1520</b> or carrier <b>1590</b> being formed in a first step and the other of the body <b>1520</b> or carrier <b>1590</b> being formed in a second step while still remaining in the same mold. For example, the carrier <b>1590</b> could be overmolded onto the body <b>1520</b> or, conversely, the body <b>1520</b> could be overmolded onto the carrier <b>1590</b>. Overmolding one over the other in a single mold will help reduce the manufacturing time it takes to create the emitter unit and, thus, speed-up the manufacturing process for producing the final drip line product.</p>
<p id="p-0175" num="0173">Emitter <b>1510</b> is similar to emitter <b>1010</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>11</b>A-E</figref>, however, the inlet sleeve <b>1732</b> does not extend all the way to the forward edge of emitter body <b>1520</b> so that it will not interfere with the bracket or carrier <b>1590</b> extending around the periphery of the emitter body <b>1520</b>. It should also be understood that in alternate embodiments a carrier may be used with any of the above-mentioned emitter embodiments. In addition, although the carrier of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>16</b>A-B</figref> is in the form of a rectangular bracket with an open middle area so that the carrier <b>1590</b> only covers the outer periphery of the lower surface of the emitter body <b>1520</b>, it should be understood that in alternate embodiments more or less of the emitter body <b>1520</b> may be covered by the carrier. For example, in one form, the carrier <b>1590</b> may form a solid rectangular structure covering the entire lower surface of the emitter body <b>1520</b> rather than having a large open middle area. However, in a preferred form, the carrier <b>1590</b> will define an opening that is at least as big as the pressure compensating portion of the emitter body <b>1520</b> (e.g., the trampoline area or recess in the bottom of body <b>1520</b>) in order to provide fluid communication between the fluid in the drip line or tube within in which the emitter is mounted and the pressure compensation portion <b>1560</b> of the emitter <b>1520</b>. In another form, the carrier <b>1590</b> may define a plurality of openings rather than one middle opening in order to further cut down on material costs so long as a sufficient amount of material is provided for the carrier <b>1590</b> so that it allows the emitter body <b>1520</b> to be smoothly moved through the insertion tool and into tubing. These plurality of openings may be located in the horizontal or bottom surface of the carrier <b>1590</b> and/or in the vertical or side surfaces of the carrier <b>1590</b> and may be made in a variety of different sizes and shapes (e.g., angled rectangular slots, rounded slots, circular openings, triangular openings, symmetrical designs, asymmetrical designs, etc.).</p>
<p id="p-0176" num="0174">Similarly, although the carrier <b>1590</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>16</b>A-B</figref> illustrate a design that only covers a portion of the sides or side walls of the emitter body <b>1520</b>, it should be understood that in alternate embodiments the carrier may be designed to cover more or less of the side walls of the emitter body <b>1520</b> (both vertically and horizontally). For example, in one form, the carrier <b>1590</b> may be designed with a skirt member having a vertical side wall that covers the entire side of the emitter body <b>1520</b>. In such a form, the emitter body <b>1520</b> would likely not be designed with a notch or shoulder recess for receiving the carrier <b>1590</b> (like the notch or shoulder recess illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>16</b>A-B</figref>), but rather would preferably have a planar side wall that the carrier <b>1590</b> simply covers. Again, the side wall of carrier <b>1590</b> could be designed with one or more openings to reduce or save on material costs associated with the carrier <b>1590</b> (as will be discussed further below with respect to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>17</b>A-B</figref>). In other forms, the vertical side wall of carrier <b>1590</b> may be designed to cover only that portion of the side wall of emitter body <b>1520</b> necessary to ensure smooth movement of the emitter body <b>1520</b> through the insertion tool and into tubing. For example, in some forms the vertical side wall may not extend all the way around the side of emitter body <b>1520</b>, but rather may only cover a portion of the side wall of emitter body <b>1520</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0177" num="0175">In another form, the carrier <b>1590</b> may be designed with no vertical wall extending about the side of the emitter body <b>1520</b>. For example, if the inserter or insertion tool used to install the emitter body <b>1520</b> into tubing only contacts the bottom surface of the structure it is inserting, the carrier <b>1590</b> could be designed to only cover the bottom surface of the emitter body <b>1520</b> as that is all that is needed to ensure smooth movement of the emitter body <b>1520</b> through the insertion tool and into the tubing. As mentioned above, in such a form, the carrier body <b>1520</b> could cover as much or as little of the bottom surface of the emitter body <b>1520</b> as desired and could define one or more openings in the bottom surface in order to save material costs and to provide fluid contact to the bottom surface of the emitter body <b>1520</b> at least where the pressure compensation portion of the emitter is located (e.g., the trampoline area or recess on the bottom side of the emitter body). In the form illustrated, the carrier <b>1590</b> remains connected to the emitter body <b>1520</b> after the emitter is connected to the inner surface of the tubing and remains connected thereafter. It should be understood that in alternate embodiments, however, the carrier <b>1590</b> may be designed to disengage from the emitter body <b>1520</b> once the emitter body <b>1520</b> is connected to the inner surface of the tube if such a configuration is desired. For example, the carrier <b>1590</b> could be returned to the insertion tool to load another emitter body <b>1520</b> or could simply drop off into the tubing and blown out of the tubing before shipping.</p>
<p id="p-0178" num="0176">Another emitter in accordance with the invention is disclosed in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>17</b>A-B</figref>. In keeping with the above-practice, features of this embodiment that are similar to those previously mentioned will be referenced using the same latter two-digit reference numeral but adding the prefix &#x201c;16&#x201d; to distinguish one embodiment from others. Thus, in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>17</b>A-B</figref> the emitter will be referenced as emitter <b>1610</b>. In the form illustrated, the emitter <b>1610</b> looks similar to the embodiment of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>16</b>A-B</figref> and <b>10</b>A-E and includes a body <b>1620</b> that defines an inlet opening <b>1630</b> and outlet bath <b>1640</b> with a tortuous fluid passage therebetween. Unlike prior embodiments, however, the emitter <b>1610</b> includes a carrier or bracket <b>1690</b> that captures portions of both the bottom and top of the emitter body <b>1620</b>. More particularly, the bottom portion of carrier <b>1690</b> includes horizontal and vertical wall members <b>1690</b><i>a</i>, <b>1690</b><i>b</i>, respectively, similar to those illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>16</b>A-B</figref>. In addition, the carrier <b>1690</b> defines a large rectangular inner opening like the carrier <b>1590</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>16</b>A-B</figref>. Unlike prior embodiments, however, the carrier <b>1690</b> further includes an upper bracket portion <b>1690</b><i>c </i>that extends above an upper portion of the emitter body <b>1620</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0179" num="0177">In the form illustrated, the body <b>1620</b> forms a recess <b>1620</b><i>a </i>and lip <b>1620</b><i>b </i>that corresponds in shape to the upper bracket <b>1690</b><i>c </i>so that when the carrier <b>1690</b> is installed on the emitter body <b>1620</b> the upper surfaces of lip <b>1620</b><i>b </i>and upper bracket <b>1690</b><i>c </i>are flush with one another. This configuration allows the upper surfaces of the upper bracket <b>1690</b><i>c </i>and emitter body parts (e.g., lip <b>1620</b><i>b</i>, outlet walls <b>1641</b><i>a</i>, <b>1641</b><i>b</i>, <b>1641</b><i>c</i>, and walls <b>1652</b><i>g</i>-<i>m</i>, etc.) to make contact with the inner surface of the tube when the emitter is installed therein so that fluid will properly flow through the inlet, along the pressure reduction portion <b>1650</b> and the pressure compensation portion <b>1660</b> of the tortuous fluid passage and into outlet bath <b>1640</b>. The upper bracket <b>1690</b><i>c </i>is spaced apart from the lower bracket portion made-up of vertical and horizontal wall members <b>1690</b><i>a</i>, <b>1690</b><i>b </i>via risers or spacers, such as posts or stanchions <b>1690</b><i>d</i>, located at the corners of the carrier <b>1690</b> and emitter body <b>1620</b>. Thus, the carrier <b>1690</b> defines a plurality of openings which saves on material costs and reduces the weight of the overall emitter <b>1610</b>. As with the embodiment in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>16</b>A-B</figref>, the inlet sleeve <b>1632</b> is recessed in from the edge of the emitter body <b>1620</b> or inset toward the center of the emitter body <b>1620</b> and away from the edge in order to allow the carrier <b>1690</b> to connect around the periphery of the emitter body <b>1620</b> (e.g., in order to allow bottom wall member <b>1690</b><i>b </i>to engage the bottom surface of emitter body <b>1620</b> about the periphery of the body <b>1620</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0180" num="0178">In the form illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>17</b>A-B</figref>, the carrier <b>1690</b> captures the emitter body <b>1620</b> between the upper and lower bracket portions <b>1690</b><i>c </i>and <b>1690</b><i>a,b</i>, respectively, and the stanchions <b>1690</b><i>d</i>, and prevents the emitter body from moving laterally along the x and y axes and longitudinally along the z axis. This configuration secures the carrier <b>1690</b> to body <b>1620</b> without the need for further fastening such as by adhesive, bonding, etc., however, additional fasteners can be used if desired. In addition, the upper surface of upper bracket <b>1690</b><i>c </i>further provides a material and surface that can assist in the connection of the emitter to tubing. With the configuration of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>17</b>A-B</figref>, cross linking between the emitter and the tugging could be enhanced by using the upper surface of upper bracket <b>1690</b><i>c </i>to ensure proper bonding between the emitter and the tubing.</p>
<p id="p-0181" num="0179">As with the embodiment of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>16</b>A-B</figref>, emitter body <b>1620</b> and carrier <b>1690</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>17</b>A-B</figref> are preferably made of an elastomeric material and a plastic polymer, respectively. In the form shown, the elastomeric body <b>1620</b> is made of TPO and the carrier <b>1690</b> is made of polyethylene. The tubing into which the emitter is inserted is also made of a plastic polymer, such as polyethylene. In a preferred form, the component is manufactured using a two-step molding process and a single mold wherein either the emitter body <b>1620</b> is made and then overmolded with the carrier <b>1690</b> or vice versa without the need to remove the structure from the mold before beginning the overmolding process. The component is then inserted into tubing and thermally bonded thereto during the extrusion of the tubing with the carrier <b>1690</b> providing for smooth passage of the emitter body <b>1620</b> through the insertion tool and into the tubing.</p>
<p id="p-0182" num="0180">It should be understood that although two carrier embodiments have been illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>16</b>A-<b>17</b>B</figref>, the carrier may be provided in a variety of different shapes and sizes.

For example, the carrier of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>17</b>A-B</figref> may be configured for use with the embodiment of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>1</b>A-J</figref>. Alternatively, a portion of the carrier of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>17</b>A-B</figref> may be used with one of the prior embodiments.

As with above embodiments, features of the emitter of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>18</b>A-B</figref> that are similar to those discussed above will use the same latter two-digit reference numeral but include the prefix &#x201c;17&#x201d; to distinguish this embodiment from others. Thus, the emitter will be referred to as emitter <b>1710</b>, which includes an inlet <b>1730</b>, outlet <b>1740</b> and tortuous flow passage extending therebetween including a pressure reduction passage <b>1750</b> and pressure compensating passage <b>1760</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0183" num="0181">In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>18</b>A-B</figref>, the emitter body <b>1720</b> defines a recess formed by horizontal wall <b>1720</b><i>a </i>and vertical wall or lip <b>1720</b><i>b </i>which are configured to receive bracket <b>1790</b>. The depth and width of recess <b>1720</b><i>a </i>and lip <b>1720</b><i>b </i>are such that bracket <b>1790</b> is positioned so that its side wall is flush with the side of emitter body <b>1720</b> and its upper surface is flush with the upper surfaces of lip <b>1720</b><i>b</i>. The depth and width of the recess formed by surface <b>1720</b><i>a </i>and lip <b>1720</b><i>b </i>will preferably allow for easy overmolding of the bracket <b>1790</b> over emitter body <b>1720</b> in a two-step molding process using the same mold. It should be understood, however, that the emitter could also be formed using two separately molded pieces that are later connected to one another. With such a configuration, the lip <b>1720</b><i>b </i>forms a shoulder that aligns and orientates the bracket <b>1790</b> into its position on emitter body <b>1720</b>. In the form illustrated, the bracket <b>1790</b> could be positioned in two orientations with one being illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>18</b>A-B</figref> and the other consisting of the bracket pivoted one hundred and eighty degrees (180&#xb0;). In alternate forms, the bracket <b>1790</b> and body <b>1720</b> could be configured to only allow assembly in one orientation, such as by adding mating structures that need to be aligned or by using shapes that only correspond with one another in one orientation. As mentioned above, however, in a preferred form, the bracket <b>1790</b> is simply molded over the emitter body <b>1720</b> using a two-step molding process and a single mold and, thus, orientation of the bracket <b>1790</b> is irrelevant as it is not assembled as a separately molded, two piece component.</p>
<p id="p-0184" num="0182">With this configuration, the upper surface of bracket <b>1790</b> will be flush with or maintain the same radius of curvature as the upper surfaces of the remaining emitter body parts (e.g., uppers surfaces of outlet walls <b>1741</b><i>a</i>-<i>c</i>, flow passage walls <b>1752</b><i>g</i>-<i>m</i>, etc.) so that the emitter body <b>1720</b> and bracket <b>1790</b> will mount cleanly to the inner surface of the tubing within which the emitter is mounted and that fluid will properly flow through the inlet <b>1730</b>, flow passage and outlet <b>1740</b>. The bracket <b>1790</b> may further be made of a material that bonds well with the tubing to enhance cross-linking or bonding problems between the emitter and tubing.</p>
<p id="p-0185" num="0183"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>19</b>A-C</figref> illustrate yet another embodiment of an emitter in accordance with the invention disclosed herein. In keeping with prior practice, items of this embodiment that are similar to those discussed previously will be identified using the same latter two-digit reference numeral, but adding the prefix &#x201c;18&#x201d; in order to distinguish this embodiment from others. Thus, the emitter will be referred to as emitter <b>1810</b>, which includes an inlet <b>1830</b>, outlet <b>1840</b> and tortuous flow passage extending therebetween or located intermediate the inlet <b>1830</b> and outlet <b>1840</b>. In a preferred form, the tortuous flow passage includes a pressure reduction passage <b>1850</b> and pressure compensating passage <b>1860</b>, and the emitter is configured in an in-line non-cylindrical emitter construction for attachment to only a portion of an inner circumference or surface of the drip line tube within which the emitter is installed (e.g., attachment to an inner circumference of one hundred eighty degrees (180&#xb0;) or less, and preferably less than ninety degrees)) (90&#xb0;)).</p>
<p id="p-0186" num="0184">As with prior embodiments, the emitter <b>1810</b> is formed of an integral or unitary elastomeric material that defines the inlet <b>1830</b>, outlet <b>1840</b> and passages located therebetween. The emitter also includes an inlet protrusion or projection <b>1832</b> like the embodiment discussed in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>10</b>A-E</figref> above. The elongated inlet protrusion <b>1832</b> forms a sleeve which extends the inlet opening <b>1830</b> more towards the center or middle of the tube into which the emitter <b>1810</b> is mounted (in a manner similar to that shown if <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>10</b>E</figref>). This allows the inlet <b>1830</b> to draw fluid from the center region of the tubing rather than at a circumferential periphery of the tubing to which the emitter is mounted. Since larger grit or other particulates or particles found in the fluid traveling through the drip line tubing tend to stay near the inner wall of the tube (near the circumferential periphery), having the sleeve <b>1832</b> project the inlet <b>1830</b> further into or toward the center of the tube helps reduce the potential that grit or other particulates will enter into and/or clog emitter <b>1810</b> or prevent it from performing as desired (and particularly the larger pieces of grit or other particulates which are more likely to cause a problem with the operation of the emitter <b>1810</b>).</p>
<p id="p-0187" num="0185">In the form illustrated, the sleeve or inlet protrusion <b>1832</b> has a rounded or beveled distal end and defines an inlet channel opening <b>1831</b> that is generally rectangular in cross-section and connects in fluid communication the outermost inlet opening located at the distal end of the inlet sleeve <b>1832</b> to the tortuous flow passage <b>1850</b> and, in particular, the pressure reducing flow section <b>1850</b> of the flow channel. The inlet sleeve <b>1832</b> extends from the longitudinal center of one end of emitter body <b>1820</b>; however, it should be understood that in alternate forms, the inlet sleeve <b>1832</b> may extend from another location on the emitter body <b>1820</b>, such as from a corner or side of the emitter body (as discussed with prior embodiments). It also should be understood that although the inlet sleeve <b>1832</b> is illustrated as a generally oval or rounded rectangular sleeve in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>19</b>A-C</figref>, the inlet sleeve <b>1832</b> may be provided in a variety of different shapes and sizes (including without limitation length and cross-section). One advantage to the rounded edges of the inlet sleeve <b>1832</b>, however, is that it reduces the number of flat surfaces located on the emitter <b>1810</b> which are typically prone to collecting grit and other particulates (e.g., grit build-up). For example, over time a film may build up on flat surfaces of the emitter due to prolonged exposure to fluid and this film can attract grit or particles that build-up over time which can interfere with fluid flow through the tubing or drip line and/or the individual emitters installed in the tubing or drip line.</p>
<p id="p-0188" num="0186">Emitter <b>1810</b> includes a pressure compensating section or portion <b>1860</b> that includes at least one stepped moveable baffle, such as a flipper or tooth member, that has an upper surface spaced apart from adjacent upper surfaces (or the uppermost bonding surfaces of the emitter <b>1810</b>) and/or from the inner surface of the tubing once the emitter <b>1810</b> is inserted in same. In a preferred form, the pressure compensation portion <b>1860</b> will included at least a pair of stepped flippers <b>1847</b><i>a</i>, <b>1847</b><i>b </i>(also referred to herein as baffles, baffle teeth or tooth members, flippers, etc.) and, in the form illustrated, the emitter <b>1810</b> contains a series of alternating stepped and moveable flippers <b>1847</b><i>a</i>, <b>1847</b><i>b </i>positioned on a trampoline portion <b>1861</b> of the emitter <b>1810</b> to form a pressure compensating moveable baffle section <b>1862</b> with steps <b>1865</b> being located at the upper surface of the base or root of each baffle flipper/tooth and the tooth tapering toward the tip or distal end of each tooth. The pressure compensating section <b>1860</b> changes volume based on the pressure change of the fluid in the tube. As the pressure in the tube increases, it raises the trampoline portion <b>1861</b> which moves the stepped baffles <b>1847</b><i>a</i>, <b>1847</b><i>b </i>toward the inner surface of the tube. This reduces the volume of the pressure compensating section <b>1860</b> (e.g., reduces the cross-sectional area of the flow passage at this portion of the emitter), which in turn, restricts the flow of fluid through the pressure compensating section <b>1860</b>. The change reduces the flow in coordination with an increase of pressure within the system (e.g., within the irrigation tubing and/or drip line network).</p>
<p id="p-0189" num="0187">By lowering the upper surface of flippers <b>1847</b><i>a</i>, <b>1847</b><i>b </i>to create steps <b>1865</b> (or creating a stepped configuration for these alternating teeth), emitter <b>1810</b> is capable of providing improved pressure compensation because bonding (e.g., partial bonding) of the upper surface of the stepped tooth is no longer a concern, and thus, the operation of the pressure compensation portion <b>1860</b> of the emitter <b>1810</b> will not be impacted based on how much of the upper surface of the tooth is bonded to the inner surface of the irrigation tubing. Without this step or lowered surface at the base thereof, it has been discovered that some pressure compensation teeth (particularly at the base of those teeth) bond to the inner surface of the irrigation tubing more than other pressure compensating teeth (from one tooth to another tooth in the same emitter and/or from one emitter to another emitter) or in a non-uniform way amongst the pressure compensating teeth (from one tooth to another tooth in the same emitter and/or from one emitter to another emitter) making it harder to form an emitter, emitters and/or drip line that operates consistently. As illustrated by the data in the following chart, the stepped flipper configuration illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>19</b>A-C</figref> provides a more consistent and repeatable pressure compensation characteristic from emitter to emitter and drip line to drip line, which is important if such items are to be mass produced.</p>
<p id="p-0190" num="0188">To illustrate this point, an emitter having a length (L) of nine hundred and one thousandths of an inch (0.901&#x2033;), width (W) of two hundred thirty two thousandths of an inch (0.232&#x2033;) and height (H) of ninety six thousandths of an inch (0.096&#x2033;) with a pressure reduction section <b>1850</b> having a flow passage with a height or floor height (FH) of twenty-five thousandths of an inch (0.025&#x2033;) and flow passage width (FW) of twenty thousandths of an inch (0.020&#x2033;) and a pressure compensation trampoline area of two hundred thousandths of an inch (0.200&#x2033;) long by two hundred thirty two thousandths of an inch (0.232&#x2033;) wide and stepped flippers <b>1847</b><i>a</i>, <b>1847</b><i>b </i>with a gusset step of five thousandths of an inch (0.005&#x2033;) down from the upper bonding surface of the adjacent or proximate emitter bonding surfaces and a floor thickness of fifteen thousandths of an inch (0.015&#x2033;) was tested under various fluid line pressures and showed remarkably steady pressure compensation (e.g., flowing steadily from seven pounds per square inch (7 psi) up to sixty pounds per square inch (60 psi)). The floor thickness of the flow passages <b>1850</b>, <b>1860</b> of the emitter <b>1810</b> is fifteen thousandths of an inch (0.015&#x2033;), and it should be understood that floor height refers to the distance from the upper surface of the floor to the top or bonding surface of the emitter <b>1810</b> (or effectively the height of the flow passage formed between the floor of the emitter and the inner surface of the tubing once the emitter is inserted therein). The inlet protrusion <b>1832</b> has a length and width of one hundred four thousandths of an inch (0.104&#x2033;) and a height of one hundred thousandths of an inch (0.100&#x2033;).

<p id="p-0192" num="0189">In the embodiment illustrated, the stepped flippers or teeth taper from a height and width of twenty thousandths of an inch (0.020&#x2033;) by forty-four thousandths of an inch (0.044&#x2033;), respectively, at the base or root of each tooth, all the way down to the floor of the flow passage of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>19</b>A-C</figref> (what also is referred to as a zero end taper or zero taper because the distal end of the tooth tapers to zero or merges into the floor surface rather than truncating in a step). It should be understood, however, that in alternate embodiments, different shapes and sizes of teeth <b>1847</b><i>a</i>, <b>1847</b><i>b </i>may be used. For example, in another form, the pressure compensation portion <b>1860</b> may alternatively include stepped flippers or teeth <b>1847</b><i>a</i>, <b>1847</b><i>b </i>that taper down to a truncated tip at the distal end of the tooth or flipper having a height of five thousandths of an inch (0.005&#x2033;) and a width of five thousandths of an inch (0.005&#x2033;), similar to that shown with respect to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>18</b>A-B</figref>. The truncation of the tip of the flippers or teeth may be in height (e.g., leaving another step down in height to the flow passage floor surface) and/or in width. In the form illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>19</b>A-C</figref>, the flippers or teeth have a zero taper, but the tips do not come to a point but rather are truncated before reaching a pointed tip. In alternate forms, however, the tapering may taper both in height and width to a zero taper. In practice, it has been found easier to mold a tip that is truncated in width than it is to mold a tip that tapers in width to zero or toward zero. However, as mentioned herein, sharper surfaces form more turbulence within the emitter and, thus, the geometry of the emitter may be altered to provide sharper or duller surfaces in order to get the emitter to perform in a desired manner (e.g., using sharper surfaces to add turbulence and create more pressure reduction throughout the emitter, use duller surfaces to reduce turbulence and create less pressure reduction throughout the emitter). The rate of taper of the flippers or teeth may also be adjusted in order to get the emitter to perform as desired. Using a slower rate of taper to obtain an emitter with a first performance characteristic and a greater rate of taper to obtain an emitter with a second performance characteristic different than the first. Any one of these modifications may be used with any number of the other modifications discussed herein in order to produce emitters with desired performance characteristics.</p>
<p id="p-0193" num="0190">In addition to having an alternate pressure compensating portion <b>1860</b>, emitter <b>1810</b> illustrates alternate outlet configuration <b>1840</b>, which includes alternate outlet protrusions or stops <b>1841</b>. In the form illustrated, the outlet protrusions <b>1841</b> are free floating or free standing walls <b>1841</b><i>a</i>, <b>1841</b><i>b</i>, <b>1841</b><i>c </i>capable of performing the function of preventing or hindering the outlet <b>1840</b> from collapsing when the fluid pressure of supply line raises to a level sufficient for deflecting the elastic floor of the emitter <b>1810</b>, similar to the outlet obstructions discussed above (e.g., <b>41</b>, <b>941</b>, etc.). Since the protrusions <b>1841</b><i>a</i>, <b>1841</b><i>b </i>and <b>1841</b><i>c </i>are freestanding, they do not connect to the outer sidewalls of the outlet <b>1840</b> and operate more similar to the post protrusions <b>41</b> in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>1</b>A-H</figref> in that they allow fluid to flow all the way around the protrusion <b>1841</b>, which helps in preventing or hindering grit/particulate buildup that could otherwise form in the corners or ends of passages (also referred to as dead ends) like those illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>10</b>A-<b>12</b>B</figref>. Thus, in the form illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>19</b>A-C</figref>, the protrusions or walls <b>1841</b><i>a</i>, <b>1841</b><i>b</i>, <b>1841</b><i>c </i>do not form dead ends in the outlet <b>1840</b> where debris can collect and build-up over time and ultimately negatively affect the operation or performance of the emitter <b>1810</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0194" num="0191">Emitter <b>1810</b> further includes an alternate fastener <b>1849</b> for securing the root growth inhibitor <b>1880</b> to the emitter <b>1810</b>. In the form illustrated, fastener <b>1849</b> comprises a protrusion, such as a shoulder, lip or rib <b>1849</b>, extending from at least one side wall of outlet <b>1840</b> for securing a copper insert <b>1880</b> into position within outlet <b>1840</b>. In a preferred form, the fastener <b>1849</b> includes at least two protrusions <b>1849</b><i>a</i>, <b>1849</b><i>b </i>(<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>19</b>C</figref>) for securing separate sides of the copper insert <b>1880</b> to securely position the insert <b>1880</b> into a desired spot within the outlet <b>1840</b>. More particularly, protrusions <b>1849</b><i>a</i>, <b>1849</b><i>b </i>are positioned on opposite sides of the outlet <b>1840</b> in order to secure opposite sides of the insert <b>1880</b> and are spaced above the floor of the outlet <b>1840</b> an amount sufficient to secure the insert <b>1880</b> flush against the floor of the outlet <b>1840</b> so that debris or particulates cannot collect under the insert <b>1880</b> or between the insert <b>1880</b> and the floor of outlet <b>1840</b>. The insert <b>1880</b> will preferably be curved or arched to track the radius of curvature of the floor of outlet <b>1840</b> to allow for such a flush mounting of the insert <b>1880</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0195" num="0192">During manufacture or assembly of emitter <b>1810</b>, the insert <b>1880</b> will preferably be press fit into the outlet <b>1840</b> by having the plate like insert <b>1880</b> inserted or disposed in the outlet <b>1840</b> and pressed passed the protruding fastener <b>1849</b> to securely mount the insert <b>1880</b> into position within the outlet <b>1840</b>. This may be accomplished manually if desired, however, in a preferred form, the insert <b>1880</b> will be automatically inserted in this way via machinery such as a press. In some embodiments, it may be desirable to apply another fastener such as an adhesive to either the floor of the outlet <b>1840</b> or the bottom surface of the insert <b>1880</b> to further bond or secure the insert to outlet <b>1840</b>. In still other forms, another fastener may be used to connect the insert <b>1880</b> to the outlet <b>1840</b> (either in lieu of or in addition to the shoulder protrusion <b>1849</b>) such as a friction fit between the insert defined openings <b>1880</b><i>a</i>, <b>1880</b><i>b</i>, <b>1880</b><i>c </i>and their respective outlet wall members <b>1841</b><i>a</i>, <b>1841</b><i>b</i>, <b>1841</b><i>c. </i></p>
<p id="p-0196" num="0193">One advantage of mechanical fasteners, such as shoulder protrusions <b>1849</b> and/or the friction fit between the insert <b>1880</b> and outlet wall members <b>1841</b>, is that no chemicals are involved in the assembly of the emitter components, and thus, there is no need for concern as to how those chemicals might react to materials, such as pesticides and fertilizers, that may be flushed through the emitter and drip line containing the emitter from time-to-time (e.g., no need for concern as to whether such pesticides, fertilizers or other such chemicals could cause the adhesive to become undone). Another advantage of such mechanical fasteners is that there is no cure time involved in getting the insert <b>1880</b> fastened to the outlet <b>1840</b> like there might otherwise be with adhesives and the like or additional cost associated with the purchase and/or application of such adhesives. A mechanical fastener can be quickly and easily fastened so that the emitter <b>1810</b> may immediately be inserted into tubing rather than requiring it to be allowed to cure or requiring additional steps such as UV treatments to facilitate bonding, etc. Insertion machinery and methods of transporting and/or inserting emitters such as those described herein are disclosed in pending U.S. Provisional Patent Application No. 61/894,296, filed Oct. 22, 2013, which is incorporated herein by reference in its entirety.</p>
<p id="p-0197" num="0194">In the form illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>19</b>A-C</figref>, the floor of the outlet <b>1840</b> and the flow passage of the pressure compensating portion <b>1860</b> and the pressure reduction portion <b>1850</b> are of a common depth (e.g., a common floor height as described above). Thus, when the insert <b>1880</b> is installed in the outlet <b>1840</b>, the insert <b>1880</b> forms a step that raises the effective floor level of the outlet <b>1840</b> and, thus, reduces the floor height in this portion of emitter <b>1810</b>. However, in alternate embodiments, it may be understood that the floor of outlet <b>1840</b> could be set at a different level or position from that of the remainder of the flow passage, if desired. For example, the floor of outlet <b>1840</b> could be sunken so that when the insert <b>1880</b> is installed in the outlet <b>1840</b> the upper surface of insert <b>1880</b> is level with the remainder of the flow passage of the emitter so that a common floor height is provided throughout the emitter <b>1810</b>. This configuration may be desired in order to prevent having a step in the flow passage where debris or particulates could collect.</p>
<p id="p-0198" num="0195">In yet other embodiments, different types of root growth inhibiting structures may be desired. For example, as discussed above with respect to earlier embodiments, different positions may be desired for the root growth inhibitor <b>1880</b>. In some forms, it may be desired to position the insert <b>1880</b> at the top of the emitter outlet <b>1840</b>, just below the inner surface of the tubing to which the emitter is mounted and/or to have the insert define an opening to the outlet of the tubing. In other forms, it may be desirable to have the insert positioned intermediate the floor of outlet <b>1840</b> and inner surface of the tubing to which the emitter is mounted, such as midway between the two and only taking up a portion of the outlet so that fluid can flow around the insert and through to the outlet of the tubing. In such configurations, the insert may have one or more passages (e.g., perforations, holes, vias, etc.) or be sized to allow fluid to pass through the emitter and out the emitter outlet. In some forms, a plurality of protruding shoulders may be positioned parallel to one another and spaced sufficiently apart from one another to allow for the insert <b>1880</b> to be sandwiched or retained between the parallel protrusions to retain the insert <b>1880</b> in the desired position. In addition and/or alternatively, the walls <b>1841</b> could be designed so that they hold the insert <b>1880</b> at the desired position. For example, walls containing a wider base than respective insert openings could be used (e.g., a wall could gradually widen toward the base to provide a point at which the insert cannot be further pressed into the outlet <b>1840</b>, a wall could be designed with a step or shoulder in an exterior surface thereof in order to place the insert at a desired position, etc.). In this way, the shoulder protrusion <b>1849</b> could alternatively be located on the inner free-standing walls <b>1841</b><i>a</i>, <b>1841</b><i>b </i>and/or <b>1841</b><i>c </i>instead of being formed in the outer upstanding walls of the outlet <b>1840</b> as illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>19</b>A-C</figref>. In yet other forms, it may be desirable to have an insert that takes up less space within outlet <b>1840</b>, such as a narrower or shorter plate that only extends about one of the outlet protrusion walls <b>1841</b><i>a</i>, <b>1841</b><i>b</i>, <b>1841</b><i>c</i>. Similarly, a structure other than a plate could be used, such as a frame that surrounds a portion of the outer upstanding walls or inner upstanding walls of the outlet <b>1840</b>. Although a solid plate type insert has been shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>19</b>A-C</figref>, it should be understood that in alternate forms the insert may be formed of a mesh or screen type structure, or a matrix type structure that allows fluid to flow through the emitter, the insert and out the emitter outlet.</p>
<p id="p-0199" num="0196">In yet other forms, it may be desirable to have the root growth inhibitor <b>1880</b> positioned elsewhere in the emitter or drip line besides the emitter outlet <b>1840</b>. For example, in some forms, it may be desirable to have the root growth inhibitor <b>1880</b> connected to the drip line outlet opening rather than the emitter <b>1810</b>. As mentioned above, the root growth inhibitor could be connected to the drip line tubing like a copper sleeve or rivet positioned at the outlet opening of the tubing. Pending International Patent Application No. PCT/US2013/046603, filed Jun. 19, 2013, illustrates an alternate outlet tube that could be connected to the drip line at the outlet and communicates with the emitter to control where fluid ultimately egresses from the emitter/drip line (e.g., at a location spaced from an outside surface of the drip line or supply tube so that the fluid does not simply run along the outer surface of the drip line/supply tube). In some forms, this outlet tube and the root growth inhibitor could be combined into one structure to perform both tasks. For example, the outlet tube could be made out of copper so that it both directs fluid flowing from the emitter away from the outer surface of the drip line and inhibits roots from growing toward the drip line and/or emitter. Thus, the disclosure of International Patent Application No. PCT/US2013/046603 filed Jun. 19, 2013 is incorporated herein by reference in its entirety, and it should be understood that the outlet tube disclosed therein could be integrated with root growth inhibitor <b>1880</b>. It should be understood that any of the features of the above embodiments may be used with one another to form a variety of different emitter embodiments. For example, in some forms, an emitter in accordance with the invention may include one or more of the inlet protrusion feature, root growth inhibitor feature, root growth inhibitor fastener feature, stepped baffle tooth or teeth feature, etc.</p>
<p id="p-0200" num="0197">Additional emitter embodiments and features are illustrated in two sheets attached hereto as an Addendum. These sheets will not be described in further detail herein due to their similarity to the embodiment of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>19</b>A-C</figref>, other than to mention that the first sheet illustrates exemplary dimensions and a design for a non-zero end tapper stepped flipper (e.g., the tip of the flipper is truncated in height and width) and the second sheet illustrates exemplary dimensions and a design for a zero end tapper stepped flipper (e.g., the flipper tapers to zero at its tip or distal end). In these embodiments, the outlet portion has walls that are not freestanding, but rather connect to one end of the outlet (e.g., one portion of the outer or peripheral wall that forms the outlet).</p>
<p id="p-0201" num="0198">Thus, it should be understood that various embodiments are contemplated in accordance with the invention disclosed herein. For example, in one form, an irrigation drip emitter for attachment to only a circumferential portion of an inner surface of an irrigation drip line tube carrying pressurized fluid is disclosed having a unitary elastomeric body defining an inlet or inlet area, an outlet or outlet area and a flow channel connecting in fluid communication the inlet and outlet or inlet area and outlet area. The flow channel defining a pressure reduction portion and a pressure compensating portion having a first volume at lower fluid pressure and a second volume smaller than the first volume at a higher fluid pressure to restrict flow through the channel. Wherein the pressure compensating portion includes one or more stepped baffle teeth having a base, a tip, an upper surface extending between the base and tip and a step along the upper surface, the step spacing at least a portion of the upper surface of the one or more stepped baffle teeth from an inner surface of the irrigation drip line tube to facilitate movement of the one or more stepped baffle teeth.</p>
<p id="p-0202" num="0199">In a preferred form, the one or more stepped baffle teeth will comprise a plurality of stepped tapered baffle teeth that alternate with one another and have a first set of stepped baffle teeth extending from a first wall and tapering in a first direction and a second set of stepped baffle teeth extending from a second wall located opposite the first wall and tapering in a second direction opposite the first direction. In some forms, the one or more stepped baffle teeth taper down to a truncated tip spaced slightly above the floor of the pressure compensating portion of the emitter. In other forms, the one or more stepped baffle teeth are tapered down to a floor of the pressure compensating portion of the emitter.</p>
<p id="p-0203" num="0200">In a preferred form, the drip emitter will include at least one freestanding wall positioned within the outlet or outlet area of the emitter such that fluid may flow entirely around exposed sides of the at least one freestanding outlet wall. In addition, the emitter may also include a root growth inhibitor positioned in or proximate the outlet or outlet area to deter roots from obstructing the flow of fluid from the emitter. In some forms, the emitter includes a fastener for securing the root growth inhibitor in the outlet area of the emitter. In the form illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>19</b>A-C</figref>, the fastener comprises at least one protrusion extending from at least one wall side surface located within the outlet or outlet area to secure the root growth inhibitor at the outlet area. Emitters such as any of those described above may be positioned within an irrigation drip line tube at predetermined intervals and, preferably, regular or equally spaced intervals to form a drip line.</p>
<p id="p-0204" num="0201">In other embodiments, irrigation drip emitters for attachment to only a circumferential portion of an inner surface of an irrigation drip line tube carrying pressurized fluid are disclosed having a unitary elastomeric body defining an inlet area, outlet area and a flow channel connecting in fluid communication the inlet and outlet areas. The flow channel defining a pressure reduction portion and a pressure compensating portion having a first volume or cross-sectional area at lower fluid pressure and a second volume or cross-sectional area smaller than the first volume or cross-sectional area at higher fluid pressure to restrict flow through the channel. In a preferred form, the emitter will have at least one freestanding outlet wall member positioned within the outlet area of the emitter such that fluid may flow entirely around exposed sides of the at least one freestanding outlet wall member.</p>
<p id="p-0205" num="0202">In yet other forms, irrigation drip emitters for attachment to only a circumferential portion of an inner surface of an irrigation drip line tube carrying pressurized fluid are disclosed herein having a unitary elastomeric body defining an inlet area, outlet area and a flow channel connecting in fluid communication the inlet and outlet areas, with the flow channel defining a pressure reduction portion and a pressure compensating portion having a first volume or cross-sectional area at lower fluid pressure and a second volume or cross-sectional area smaller than the first volume at higher fluid pressure to restrict flow through the channel. The emitter further having a root growth inhibitor positioned in or proximate the outlet area to deter roots from obstructing the flow of fluid from the emitter and having a fastener for securing the root growth inhibitor in or proximate the outlet area of the emitter.</p>
<p id="p-0206" num="0203">In still other forms, a non-cylindrical irrigation drip emitter for attachment to only a circumferential portion of an inner surface of an irrigation drip line tube carrying pressurized fluid is disclosed herein having a unitary elastomeric body defining an inlet area, outlet area and a flow channel therebetween connecting the inlet and outlet areas, with the flow channel defining a pressure reduction portion and a pressure compensating portion having a first volume or cross-sectional area at lower fluid pressure and a volume or cross-sectional area smaller than the first volume or cross-sectional area at higher fluid pressure to restrict flow through the channel. The pressure compensating portion including at least one baffle tooth having a base, a tip and an upper surface extending between the base and tip, with the at least one baffle tooth further having a stepped configuration wherein the base of the tooth is positioned at a height different from a proximate upper bonding surface of the emitter.</p>
<p id="p-0207" num="0204">In one form, the at least one baffle tooth is tapered downward from the base toward the tip and is moveable between a first lower pressure position wherein the upper surface of the at least one baffle tooth is spaced apart from an inner surface of the irrigation drip line tube by a first distance and which coincides with the first volume of the pressure compensating portion and a second higher pressure position wherein the upper surface of the at least one baffle tooth is spaced apart from the inner surface of the irrigation drip line tube by a second distance less than the first distance and coincides with the second volume of the pressure compensating portion. In a preferred form, the at least one baffle tooth is tapered down so that the tip of the tooth is flush with a floor of the pressure compensating portion of the emitter (e.g., a zero-taper configuration). As with prior embodiments, the at least one baffle tooth may comprise a plurality of stepped tapered baffle teeth each being moveable between the first lower pressure position and the second higher pressure position. Similarly, the plurality of stepped tapered baffle teeth may alternate with one another with a first set of stepped baffle teeth extending from a first wall and tapering in a first direction and a second set of stepped baffle teeth extending from a second wall located opposite the first wall and tapering in a second direction opposite the first direction.</p>
<p id="p-0208" num="0205">In some forms, the non-cylindrical irrigation drip emitter may include at least one freestanding outlet wall member positioned within the outlet area of the emitter such that fluid may flow entirely around exposed sides of the at least one freestanding outlet wall member, and may include a root growth inhibitor positioned in or proximate the outlet area to deter roots from obstructing the flow of fluid from the emitter. A fastener for securing the root growth inhibitor in or proximate to the outlet area of the emitter may also be provided and/or used. For example, in the form illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>19</b>A-C</figref>, the fastener comprises at least one protruding shoulder extending from at least one wall side surface located within the outlet area that secures the root growth inhibitor into the outlet area.</p>
<p id="p-0209" num="0206">Although most of the embodiments discuss herein have specified a unitary emitter body constructed of elastomeric material, it should be understood that any of the above embodiments may be provided in other materials if desired for particular applications. For example, in some forms it may be desired to provide non-pressure compensating versions of the above emitters. In such instances, the emitter bodies may be made of more rigid material, such as polyethylene or any material with a higher durometer number, since movement of emitter body portions in response to increases and decreases in fluid pressure in the drip line is not required in non-pressure compensating versions of the emitters.</p>
<p id="p-0210" num="0207">It should also be understood that in alternate embodiments, the geometry or design of the emitter may be changed in order to get the emitter to perform in a desired manner for a particular application. For example, in some instances, an emitter with a higher flow rate may be desired, e.g., 1 gallon/hour (1 gph), instead of one with a lower flow rate, e.g., 0.2 gallon/hour (0.2 gph). In such cases, the emitter may be designed with fewer teeth in the pressure reduction (PR) region or portion of the emitter, fewer teeth in the pressure compensating (PC) region or portion of the emitter, with a flow channel with a greater depth (or greater floor height), with teeth and flow channel geometries that present less pressure reduction or greater fluid flow through the emitter (e.g., more rounded edges, less flat surfaces, softer angles, etc.), and the like. In addition, the entire emitter or just a portion of the emitter, such as the PC portion, could be made of a stiffer material with a higher durometer value so that the emitter chokes up or constricts less to allow for a higher flow rate. Alternatively or in addition, the emitter body or portions thereof (e.g., the trampoline of the PC portion) could be made thicker so that it is less flexible and chokes up or constricts less. As mentioned herein, the shape of structures may be made sharper or duller/more dull to alter performance, the rate of taper of the teeth in the PC or PR section may be altered to change performance, etc.</p>
<p id="p-0211" num="0208">In still other embodiments, the emitter could be designed to have one or more receptacles for receiving different emitter portions (e.g., portions with different geometries, such as different shapes, sizes, patterns, designs, etc., and/or portions that are made of different materials so that the emitter may be provided in different flow rates or with different optional features intended for a particular application). For example, in one form, the emitter may be designed with a receptacle for receiving different PR portions to provide emitters with different flow rates (e.g., 0.2 gph, 0.5 gph, 1.0 gph, 2.0 gph, 5.0 gph, 7.0 gph, 10.0 gph, 12.0 gph, 18.0 gph, 24.0 gph, etc.). In one form, a lower flow rate PR portion insert may be provided with additional teeth, teeth with more turbulence-inducing features or shapes, a smaller flow passage cross-section, etc. In another form, a higher flow rate PR portion insert may be provided with fewer teeth, teeth with smoother features or shapes, a larger flow passage cross-section, etc. The different PR portion inserts may be inserted into the receptacle and optionally secured thereto via any form of fastener, such as a friction fit, an adhesive, overmolding (e.g., having the insert molded over the remainder of the emitter body or having the emitter body molded over the insert, etc.). In a preferred form, the inserts will be friction fit into the emitter and emitters with common inserts placed into a vibratory drum feeder for manufacturing drip line with common emitter flow rates as disclosed in pending U.S. Provisional Patent Application No. 61/894,296, filed Oct. 22, 2013, which has been incorporated herein by reference in its entirety above.</p>
<p id="p-0212" num="0209">In alternate forms, the emitter may be designed with a receptacle for receiving different PC portions to provide emitters with different properties (e.g., flow rates, reaction times to variances in supply line fluid pressure, etc.). In one form, a lower flow rate PC portion and/or a faster reacting PC portion insert may be provided with additional teeth, teeth with more turbulence-inducing features or shapes, smaller flow passage cross-section, made of a material or structure with a higher durometer (e.g., with a higher durometer value), etc. In another form, a higher flow rate PC portion insert may be provided with fewer teeth, teeth with smoother features or shapes, a larger flow passage cross-section, made of a material or structure with a lower durometer value, etc.</p>
<p id="p-0213" num="0210">In still other forms, the emitter may be designed with a plurality of receptacles for receiving different emitter portions (e.g., emitter inlet portions, PR portions, PC portions and/or outlet portions, etc.). For example, in some forms the emitter may be provided with first and second receptacles for receiving PR portion and PC portion inserts, respectively. In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>20</b>A-B</figref> an exemplary embodiment of an emitter with removable, replaceable, or swappable PR and PC inserts is shown. In keeping with the above practice, items that are similar to those discussed above with respect to other embodiments are identified using similar latter two-digit reference numerals, but having the prefix <b>19</b> to distinguish one embodiment from the others. Thus, in this embodiment, the emitter is referenced generally by reference numeral <b>1910</b> and includes an emitter body <b>1920</b> made of a uniform elastomeric material and defining an emitter inlet <b>1930</b> and outlet <b>1940</b> integral to the emitter body <b>1920</b> with a flow passage extending between the inlet <b>1930</b> and outlet <b>1940</b>. In a preferred form, the flow passage includes a pressure reduction portion <b>1950</b> and a pressure compensating portion <b>1960</b>. Unlike prior embodiments, however, the emitter includes a pressure reduction (&#x201c;PR&#x201d;) insert <b>1950</b><i>a </i>and a pressure compensating (&#x201c;PC&#x201d;) inset <b>1960</b><i>a </i>which are disposed within mating recesses defined by the emitter body <b>1920</b>. The mating recesses form sockets within which the PR insert <b>1950</b><i>a </i>and PC insert <b>1960</b><i>a </i>may be inserted or disposed prior to the emitter being connected to tubing.</p>
<p id="p-0214" num="0211">Thus, with this configuration, emitter <b>1910</b> defines an open-face non-cylindrical irrigation drip emitter for attachment to only a circumferential portion of an inner surface of an irrigation drip line tube carrying pressurized fluid. The emitter <b>1910</b> includes an emitter body made of elastomeric material and defining at least one recess for receiving an insert (e.g., at least one of the recess for receiving insert <b>1950</b>, the recess for receiving insert <b>1960</b>, etc.). The emitter <b>1910</b> further includes the insert (e.g., <b>1950</b><i>a</i>, <b>1950</b><i>b</i>, <b>1960</b><i>a</i>, <b>1960</b><i>b</i>, etc.) disposed within the recess defined by the emitter body <b>1920</b>, together the emitter body and insert defining a flow passage between an inlet and outlet through which fluid may travel. In a preferred form, the recess defined by the emitter body <b>1920</b> is an open-faced socket having a first wall that extends about a majority of a side periphery of the insert and a second wall that traverses an opening defined by the first wall to close an end of the recess and define the open-faced socket within which the insert is disposed, the insert being disposed within the open-faced socket by a sufficient amount to allow an upper surface of the insert and an adjacent upper surface of the emitter body to be flush with one another so that the emitter assembly may be bonded to an inner surface of conduit without gaps forming between the upper surfaces of the emitter body and insert and the inner surface of conduit.</p>
<p id="p-0215" num="0212">In this way, the emitter <b>1910</b> can be customized for a particular purpose (e.g., application, environment, flow rate, etc.) by allowing different types of inserts to be installed for the various pressure reduction and pressure compensating portions. For example, the inserts <b>1950</b><i>a</i>, <b>1960</b><i>a </i>may be desired and used to form an emitter having a first fluid flow rate (e.g., 0.195 gallons per hour (GPH) or approximately 0.2 GPH). Whereas, alternate inserts <b>1950</b><i>b</i>, <b>1960</b><i>b </i>shown in broken line in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>20</b>B</figref> may be desired and used to form an emitter having a second fluid flow rate different from the first fluid flow rate (e.g., 1 GPH). The inserts <b>1950</b><i>a</i>-<i>b</i>, <b>1960</b><i>a</i>-<i>b </i>can do this by defining flow passages of different size, shape, pattern, or characteristic, by using materials with different durometers (whether that be from the material chosen itself or from differences in the thickness or shape of the material, etc.), by using baffle teeth of different geometries (e.g., shapes, sizes, etc.) or with a different number of baffle teeth, etc. For example, one set of PC inserts <b>1860</b><i>a</i>, <b>1860</b><i>b </i>may be provided with stepped flippers or moveable baffle teeth that taper down to zero at their distal end, whereas in other forms another set of PC inserts <b>1860</b><i>b</i>, <b>1860</b><i>a </i>may be provided with flippers or moveable baffle teeth that are not stepped at their base and that are truncated at their end rather than tapering down flush to the floor of the flow passage. In other forms, one set of PR inserts <b>1850</b><i>a</i>, <b>1850</b><i>b </i>may be provided with a first flow passage pattern and/or a first number of baffle teeth to achieve an emitter with a first characteristic, whereas in other forms another set of PR inserts <b>1850</b><i>b</i>, <b>1850</b><i>a </i>may be provided with a second flow passage pattern and/or a second number of baffle teeth (both different than the respective first flow passage pattern and number of baffle teeth) to achieve an emitter with a second characteristic different than the first characteristic.</p>
<p id="p-0216" num="0213">In a preferred form, the PR and PC inserts <b>1950</b>, <b>1960</b> are made of the same elastomeric material as the remainder of the emitter body <b>1920</b> and the upper surfaces of the inserts <b>1950</b>, <b>1960</b> have the same radius of curvature as the upper surfaces of the remainder of the emitter body <b>1920</b> so that the assembled emitter <b>1910</b> (including the body <b>1920</b> and inserts <b>1950</b>, <b>1960</b>) can be bonded to the inner surface of tubing or conduit to produce a properly working emitter and drip line that does not leak and that drips fluid at the intended or desired flow rate. By having a common radius of curvature, the upper surfaces of the emitter body <b>1920</b> and inserts <b>1950</b>, <b>1960</b> will remain flush with one another so that the emitter <b>1910</b> can be bonded to the inside surface of tubing or conduit without gaps that could result in leaks.</p>
<p id="p-0217" num="0214">In other examples, the emitter may be provided with inlet and/or outlet receptacles for receiving inlet and/or outlet portion inserts (either in addition to or in lieu of the PR and PC portion inserts). In yet other forms, the inlet may be formed integral to the PR portion and thus removable and insertable with the PR portion. It should be understood that the emitter may be provided with any one or more of such receptacles and inserts and that any of the insert or insert portions discussed herein may optionally be secured to the emitter via a fastener or the like as discussed above.</p>
<p id="p-0218" num="0215">In addition to different geometries, different inserts may be used to allow a consumer to customize the emitter for a particular application or to provide options that can be added to or removed from the emitter. For example, in some applications such as steeply inclined or declined landscape (e.g., hilly or mountainous regions, etc.) inserts may be provided with optional check valve designs used to prevent fluid from flowing out of the emitters or drip line when not intended. In other applications, a protruding inlet that draws fluid from an inner portion of the supply or drip line (e.g., like that illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>10</b>A-<b>14</b>B and <b>16</b>A-<b>19</b>C</figref>) may be desired; whereas, in still other applications a non-protruding inlet may be desired to draw fluid from an outer periphery or circumference of the supply line or dip line may be desired (e.g., like that shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>1</b>A-<b>9</b>B and <b>15</b>A</figref>-B). Thus, with this configuration, emitters in accordance with the invention may be customized for various applications, such as specific applications and/or based on specific attributes with respect to the environment the emitters will be used in.</p>
<p id="p-0219" num="0216">Several different patterns for flow passages have been disclosed herein and it should be understood that numerous other designs are contemplated under this disclosure and can be configured to get the emitters to operate at the desired flow rate and/or with the desired grit tolerance or performance. In other forms, a different flow path may be utilized to reduce fluid pressure and/or compensate for fluctuations in fluid line pressure within the tube an emitter is mounted. An example of one such alternate design is illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>21</b>A-F</figref> and, in keeping with prior practice, will use the same latter two-digit reference numeral for items similar to those discussed previously, but add the prefix <b>20</b> to distinguish this embodiment from others. Thus, in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>21</b>A-F</figref>, the emitter is referenced generally as reference numeral <b>2010</b> and includes a unitary body of elastomeric material <b>2020</b> that forms an inlet <b>2030</b>, an outlet <b>2040</b> and a flow path extending between the inlet and the outlet including a pressure reduction (&#x201c;PR&#x201d;) portion <b>2050</b> and a pressure compensating (&#x201c;PC&#x201d;) portion <b>2060</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0220" num="0217">In a preferred form, emitter <b>2010</b> is a discrete, single piece elastomeric emitter intended to be attached to only a portion of an inner circumference of an inner surface of an irrigation drip line tube like tube <b>70</b> in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b>A</figref> and tube <b>970</b> in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>10</b>E</figref>. The discrete elastomeric emitter body <b>2020</b> integrally defines the inlet <b>2030</b> on a first side of the body for receiving pressurized fluid from a fluid supply source, the outlet <b>2040</b> on a second side of the body for discharging the fluid from the body, with a flow channel extending between the inlet <b>2030</b> and outlet <b>2040</b> and including the above-mentioned PR portion <b>2050</b> and PC portion <b>2060</b>. The emitter further defines at least one internal wall that is movable to adjust the pressure and/or flow rate of the fluid received at the inlet and discharged through the outlet and a perimeter wall forming at least a portion of an exterior of the emitter body and forming at least a portion of a curved upper surface of the emitter body <b>2020</b> that is shaped to correspond to an interior radius of curvature of the portion of the inner circumference of the inner surface of the irrigation drip line tube to which the emitter body is to be mounted. In some forms, the internal wall is located in the PC portion <b>2060</b> of the emitter <b>2010</b> and moves along with other portions of the PC portion <b>2060</b> of the emitter (e.g., the floor of the PC portion) in response to a change in pressure of the pressurized fluid traveling through the tube from the fluid supply source. A preferred dripline is then formed by bonding the emitter <b>2010</b> at regular intervals to the inner surface of the tube and then forming an outlet opening through the tube over or aligned with the outlet <b>2040</b> so that fluid can flow from the tube.</p>
<p id="p-0221" num="0218">As with prior embodiments discussed above, at least a portion of the emitter body <b>2010</b> further defines a generally planar floor in the outlet <b>2040</b> and an obstruction, such as posts or walls <b>2041</b><i>a</i>, <b>2041</b><i>b </i>and <b>2041</b><i>c</i>, that extends upward from the floor for preventing the outlet <b>2040</b> from collapsing in response to increases in pressure of the pressurized fluid within the tube. The obstructions <b>2041</b><i>a</i>-<i>c </i>could be any shape, but preferably will be posts or walls and will include a curved upper surface that corresponds in height and shape to the curved upper surface of the emitter body <b>2020</b>. In the form illustrated, emitter <b>2010</b> further includes an inlet protrusion <b>2032</b> that extends from the emitter body and away from the emitter proximate the inlet <b>2030</b> to draw fluid from a location closer to the center of the tube which tends to have fluid with less debris than the fluid traveling near the inner surface of the tube.</p>
<p id="p-0222" num="0219">Unlike prior embodiments, however, emitter <b>2010</b> has a multi-stage PR portion <b>2050</b> including a serpentine shaped tortuous flow passage having a first portion <b>2050</b><i>a </i>containing baffles and a second portion <b>2050</b><i>b </i>without baffles. The portion with baffles <b>2050</b><i>a </i>is positioned proximate the inlet <b>2030</b> and, in particular, downstream of the inlet <b>2030</b>. The flow path then transitions from the portion with baffles <b>2050</b><i>a </i>to the PR portion without baffles <b>2050</b><i>b</i>, which in the form illustrated comprises smooth walls or a buffer zone devoid of baffles as the flow path transitions from the portion with baffles to the PC portion <b>2060</b>. The upper surfaces of both PR portions <b>2050</b><i>a </i>and <b>2050</b><i>b </i>are of the same height (or of equal or constant height) and preferably track the radius of curvature of the upper surfaces of the emitter <b>2010</b>, which corresponds to the radius of curvature of the inner tube surface to which the emitter <b>2010</b> is ultimately bonded in order to provide a sealed flow passage between the emitter <b>2010</b> and tube.</p>
<p id="p-0223" num="0220">As illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>20</b>A-E</figref>, the tortuous flow passage of emitter <b>2010</b> is defined by a plurality of baffles and is laid out in a winding serpentine path. The plurality of baffles comprise baffles of constant height (e.g., those in PR portion <b>2050</b><i>a</i>) and baffles of tapering height (e.g., baffles <b>2067</b><i>a</i>, <b>2067</b><i>b </i>in PC portion <b>2060</b>). The baffles of constant height are positioned in the first portion <b>2050</b><i>a </i>of pressure reduction portion <b>2050</b> of the flow passage and the baffles of tapering height <b>2067</b><i>a</i>, <b>2067</b><i>b </i>are positioned in the pressure compensation portion <b>2060</b> of the flow passage. More particularly, the baffles of constant height are positioned downstream of the inlet <b>2030</b> and the baffles of tapering height <b>2067</b><i>a</i>, <b>2067</b><i>b </i>are positioned downstream of the baffles of constant height in PR portion <b>2050</b><i>a </i>and upstream of the outlet <b>2040</b>. The second portion <b>2050</b><i>b </i>of PR portion <b>2050</b> forms a serpentine flow passage and buffer zone between the baffles of constant height and the baffles of tapering height free or devoid of any baffles.</p>
<p id="p-0224" num="0221">The flow passage of emitter <b>2010</b> transitions from the PR portion without baffles <b>2050</b><i>b </i>to the PC portion <b>2060</b>. The PC portion <b>2060</b> further includes one or more movable baffles, such as tapered baffles <b>2067</b><i>a </i>and <b>2067</b><i>b</i>. In a preferred form and as best illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>21</b>D and <b>21</b>E</figref>, the tapered baffles <b>2067</b><i>a</i>, <b>2067</b><i>b </i>are stepped baffles with the upper baffle surface being stepped down from the upper surface of the adjacent wall structure from which the baffle extends. The steps <b>2065</b><i>a </i>and <b>2065</b><i>b </i>are located at the base of the baffles and the baffles taper toward the distal end of the baffles and toward the floor of the flow passage. In some forms, the baffles taper all the way down to the floor of the flow passage (also known as a zero taper), while in other forms they have less of a taper such that the distal end still protrudes up from or forms a step with the floor of the PC portion <b>2060</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0225" num="0222">Thus, emitter <b>2010</b> forms an irrigation drip emitter for attachment to only a portion of an inner circumference of an inner surface of an irrigation drip line tube having a discrete elastomeric emitter body <b>2020</b> integrally defining an inlet <b>2030</b> on a first side of the body <b>2020</b> for receiving pressurized fluid from a fluid supply source, an outlet <b>2040</b> on a second side of the body for discharging the fluid from the body, a flow channel extending between the inlet <b>2020</b> and outlet <b>2030</b> for reducing a pressure and flow of fluid received at the inlet <b>2030</b> and discharged through the outlet <b>2040</b>. The flow channel defined by at least one inner wall and further including a pressure compensating portion <b>2060</b> having a plurality of baffles <b>2067</b><i>a</i>, <b>2067</b><i>b </i>extending from one or more side walls that border the pressure compensating portion <b>2060</b>, with at least two baffles extending from the one or more side walls that border the pressure compensating portion <b>2060</b> and separating the pressure compensating portion <b>2060</b> into an upstream portion <b>2060</b><i>a </i>and a downstream portion <b>2060</b><i>b </i>with the upstream portion <b>2060</b><i>a </i>having a larger area and volume than the downstream portion <b>2060</b><i>b </i>to ensure greater pressure is exerted on the upstream portion than the downstream portion to assist in flushing the emitter <b>2010</b> of grit, as explained further below.</p>
<p id="p-0226" num="0223">More particularly, when the emitter <b>2010</b> is bonded to the inside of a drip tube and fluid pressure within the drip tube increases, pressure is exerted on the exterior of the floor <b>2061</b> of the pressure compensating portion <b>2060</b> thereby causing the floor <b>2061</b> and at least two baffles <b>2067</b><i>a</i>, <b>2067</b><i>b </i>to move toward the tube surface to which the emitter <b>2010</b> is bonded. This reduces the cross-section of the flow channel <b>2050</b>, <b>2060</b> (or flow passage opening) defined by the emitter <b>2010</b> and tube to which it is bonded and allows the emitter <b>2010</b> to compensate for the fluid pressure increase by making a corresponding decrease in flow passage cross-section to control the amount of fluid flowing therethrough. Also, the distal ends of the at least two baffles <b>2067</b><i>a</i>, <b>2067</b><i>b </i>form a pinch point or constriction <b>2060</b><i>c </i>through which the fluid must travel in order to pass through the flow passage and on to the outlet <b>2040</b> of the emitter. In the form illustrated, baffles <b>2067</b><i>a</i>, <b>2067</b><i>b </i>extend out from separate side walls that border the pressure compensating portion <b>2060</b> toward one another and in an upstream direction, with one of the at least two baffles <b>2067</b><i>a</i>, <b>2067</b><i>b </i>extending further than the other in order to create another pressure reducing turn for fluid traveling through the flow passage. In the form illustrated, the baffles <b>2067</b><i>a</i>, <b>2067</b><i>b </i>angle upstream and baffle <b>2067</b><i>a </i>extends further upstream than baffle <b>2067</b><i>b </i>in order to create an additional turn for the fluid traveling through the pinch point <b>2060</b><i>c </i>created by the ends of the baffles <b>2067</b><i>a</i>, <b>2067</b><i>b. </i></p>
<p id="p-0227" num="0224">Emitter <b>2010</b> includes a perimeter wall forming at least a portion of an exterior of the emitter body <b>2020</b> and forms a curved upper surface of the emitter body that is shaped to correspond to the inner radius of curvature of the tube to which the emitter is bonded (e.g., to an interior radius of curvature of the portion of the inner circumference of the inner surface of the irrigation drip line tube to which the emitter body is to be mounted). The step <b>2065</b><i>a</i>, <b>2065</b><i>b </i>in the at least two baffles <b>2067</b><i>a</i>, <b>2067</b><i>b </i>positions the upper surface of the baffles <b>2067</b><i>a</i>, <b>2067</b><i>b </i>below the upper surface of the remainder of the emitter or at least the perimeter wall of the emitter <b>2010</b>. The steps <b>2065</b><i>a</i>, <b>2065</b><i>b </i>allow fluid to flow over at least some portions of the baffles <b>2067</b><i>a</i>, <b>2067</b><i>b </i>at all times, but primarily allow the baffles <b>2067</b><i>a</i>, <b>2067</b><i>b </i>to move more consistently from emitter to emitter and, thus, allow the emitters to be manufactured with more repeatable accuracy (again emitter to emitter). In turn, this means that emitters with more consistent performance from emitter to emitter will yield dripline with more consistent performance (dripline to dripline). In a preferred process, a plurality of emitters of the type disclosed herein (both above and below) will be bonded to the inner surface of drip line tubing, at regular intervals, as the tubing is extruded and then an opening (e.g., hole, slit, etc.) will be formed in the tubing over the emitter outlet <b>2040</b> in order to form operational drip line tubing that allows fluid flowing through the tubing to flow into the emitter inlet <b>2030</b>, through the flow passage <b>2050</b>, <b>2060</b> to the emitter outlet <b>2040</b> and then out through the opening (e.g., hole, slit, etc.) formed in the drip line tubing.</p>
<p id="p-0228" num="0225">The emitter <b>2010</b> preferably defines a generally planar floor in the outlet <b>2040</b> and an obstruction, such as walls <b>2041</b><i>a</i>-<i>c</i>, extending upward from the floor for preventing the outlet <b>2040</b> from collapsing in response to increases in pressure of the pressurized fluid traveling through the drip line tubing. In the form illustrated, the obstruction comprises a first wall <b>2041</b><i>b </i>extending from a side wall defining a portion of the outlet <b>2040</b> and extending into a center of the outlet <b>2040</b>, and two additional free standing walls <b>2041</b><i>a</i>, <b>2041</b><i>c </i>positioned on opposite sides of the first wall <b>2040</b><i>b </i>and spaced from any side walls defining the outlet <b>2040</b> so as to prevent creating dead ends or zones where grit/debris can become trapped within the emitter. The upstanding edges of the walls can be curved. These features help the emitter <b>2010</b> flush grit that may be encountered during use of the emitter <b>2010</b> in normal applications or uses.</p>
<p id="p-0229" num="0226">An inlet protrusion <b>2032</b> that extends away from the emitter body <b>2020</b> to draw fluid from a position closer to the center of the irrigation drip line tube instead of from an outer periphery of the tube is also illustrated and helps reduce the amount of grit introduced into the emitter <b>2010</b>. In some forms, the inlet protrusion <b>2032</b> may define a channel or channels on a distal end thereof, such as the channels <b>1332</b><i>a</i>-<i>f </i>illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>14</b>A-B</figref> above, which are sized to deflect foreign material (e.g., grit/debris) from obstructing the inlet or entering the emitter body <b>2010</b> with the channel being defined by an exterior surface of the inlet protrusion, as has been discussed in alternate embodiments disclosed herein. However, in the form illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>21</b>A-E</figref>, such an inlet protrusion channel or filter is not needed in all forms of the emitter given the grit flushing ability of emitter <b>2010</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0230" num="0227">Thus, when inserted into tubing, the emitter <b>2010</b> and tubing form irrigation dripline having a tube with an inside surface, at least one discrete elastomeric emitter body <b>2010</b> attached to the inside surface of the tube and integrally defining: an inlet on a first side of the body <b>2020</b> for receiving pressurized fluid from the tube; a pressure reducing flow channel <b>2050</b> extending from the inlet <b>2030</b> for reducing a pressure and flow of fluid received at the inlet <b>2030</b>; and a pressure compensating chamber <b>2060</b> configured to receive fluid from the pressure reducing flow channel <b>2050</b>. The PC chamber <b>2060</b> is defined by moveable floor <b>2061</b> and at least two opposing side walls and the inside surface of the tubing to which the emitter is connected. The chamber <b>2060</b> preferably includes at least two teeth or baffles <b>2067</b><i>a</i>, <b>2067</b><i>b</i>, with one extending from each of the at least two opposing side walls toward a center region of the chamber <b>2060</b>. The at least two teeth <b>2067</b><i>a</i>, <b>2067</b><i>b </i>dividing the chamber <b>2060</b> into at least an upstream portion <b>2060</b><i>a </i>and a downstream portion <b>2060</b><i>b</i>, the upstream portion <b>2060</b><i>a </i>being larger than the downstream portion <b>2060</b><i>b</i>, and the two teeth <b>2067</b><i>a</i>, <b>2067</b><i>b </i>being moveable toward and away from the inside surface of the tube an amount depending on the pressure of the fluid in the tube to adjust the pressure and flow of the fluid received from the pressure reducing flow channel <b>2050</b>. In the form illustrated, the teeth <b>2067</b><i>a</i>, <b>2067</b><i>b </i>originate from a position in the chamber closer to the outlet <b>2040</b> than the PR flow passage <b>2050</b> and angle upstream toward the center region of the PC chamber <b>2060</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0231" num="0228">In a preferred form, the pressure reducing flow channel <b>2050</b> has a floor or bottom with a first thickness and the moveable floor <b>2061</b> of pressure compensation chamber <b>2060</b> has a second thickness, the second thickness being less than the first thickness to allow sufficient movement of the moveable floor <b>2061</b> relative to the remainder of the emitter and/or the tubing for providing a predetermined range of movement for the moveable floor. More particular, in the form illustrated, the exterior of emitter body <b>2020</b> is recessed (e.g., into the side from which inlet protrusion <b>2132</b> extends) to reduce thickness of the movable floor <b>2061</b> as compared to the remainder of the emitter <b>2010</b> (and in particular the floor of the pressure reduction flow channel <b>2050</b> and outlet <b>2040</b>). This allows the moveable floor <b>2061</b> to operate like a trampoline and more easily move teeth or baffles <b>2067</b><i>a</i>, <b>2067</b><i>b </i>and/or makes the emitter <b>2010</b> more easily reproducible with consistent performance characteristics. A cross-sectional view exemplifying this floor thickness is shown and will be discussed further with respect to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>24</b>E</figref>. Although the floor of the remainder of the flow passage (e.g., pressure reduction portion) and the outlet illustrated in that cross-sectional view is illustrated as rather thick, in alternate embodiments moveable floors of different thickness may be used, such as thinner floors like the one illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>19</b>B</figref> (see floor <b>1861</b>).</p>
<p id="p-0232" num="0229">In operation, the teeth <b>2067</b><i>a</i>, <b>2067</b><i>b </i>move toward the wall of the drip line tube to which the emitter is connected as pressure of the supply fluid in the tube increases. This causes the passage over the teeth <b>2067</b><i>a</i>, <b>2067</b><i>b </i>to become smaller and, therefore, restricts flow past the teeth <b>2067</b><i>a</i>, <b>2067</b><i>b</i>. As pressure of the supply fluid in the tube decreases, the teeth <b>2067</b><i>a</i>, <b>2067</b><i>b </i>move away from the wall of the drip line tube to which the emitter is connected (e.g., away from the inner tube surface) to allow more fluid to flow through the emitter (e.g., over teeth <b>2067</b><i>a</i>, <b>2067</b><i>b</i>). In addition, one tooth extends slightly further upstream than the other in order to introduce yet another turn in the flow passage as the teeth are constricted for further pressure reduction. In a preferred form, the emitter <b>2010</b> is configured to produce drips of fluid at a 0.4 gallon per hour (0.4 gph) flow rate.</p>
<p id="p-0233" num="0230">As mentioned, there is potential for obstructions, such as grit, to affect or even clog the emitter <b>2010</b>, especially at the teeth <b>2067</b><i>a</i>, <b>2067</b><i>b </i>in the pressure compensation portion or chamber <b>2060</b>. For instance, as the supply line fluid pressure increases, the teeth <b>2067</b><i>a</i>, <b>2067</b><i>b </i>move toward the inner surface of the tube creating a constriction along the top of the teeth <b>2067</b><i>a</i>, <b>2067</b><i>b </i>(as described above). There also is a constriction between the distal ends of the teeth <b>2067</b><i>a</i>, <b>2067</b><i>b</i>. As these constrictions form, the risk of grit clogging the edges of teeth <b>2067</b><i>a</i>, <b>2067</b><i>b </i>increases as does the risk for complete blockage or clogging of the emitter <b>2010</b>. Once the blockage or clogging affects the flow too much, pressure will build up on the upstream side <b>2060</b><i>a </i>of teeth <b>2067</b><i>a</i>, <b>2067</b><i>b</i>. Since the area of the floor <b>2061</b> on the upstream side <b>2060</b><i>a </i>of the teeth and the volume of that upstream portion of the PC chamber is greater than the area of the floor on the downstream side <b>2060</b><i>b </i>and the volume of that downstream portion of the PCT chamber, the pressure will cause the floor <b>2061</b> to move away from the inside surface of the tube. This will cause the teeth <b>2067</b><i>a</i>, <b>2067</b><i>b </i>to also move away from the inner surface of the tube, which permits the debris forming the clog or blockage to be flushed from the pressure regulating chamber <b>2060</b> over the teeth <b>2067</b><i>a</i>, <b>2067</b><i>b</i>. Once the blockage or clog is flushed sufficiently, the pressure build-up on the upstream side <b>2060</b><i>a </i>of the teeth <b>2067</b><i>a</i>, <b>2067</b><i>b </i>will drop and the pressure compensating chamber <b>2060</b> will resume its normal pressure compensating function.</p>
<p id="p-0234" num="0231">In a preferred form, the walls or teeth <b>2067</b><i>a</i>, <b>2067</b><i>b </i>are angled or pointed upstream on an intersecting course from the walls from which they extend within the pressure compensating chamber <b>2060</b> in order to prevent the teeth <b>2067</b><i>a</i>, <b>2067</b><i>b </i>from forming a funnel that could get clogged more easily and frequently. This is counter-intuitive as one would normally think to have the baffles aligned or funnel downstream in order to assist with fluid flow and, in particular, the flushing of grit/debris. It also is counter-intuitive in that the design used appears to form dead ends or zones at the upstream side of the base of each tooth where the tooth connects to the side wall from which it extends. However, applicant has found that by using this configuration the volume and area of the upstream side <b>2060</b><i>a </i>of the pressure compensation portion <b>2060</b> is capable of being made larger than the volume and area of the downstream side <b>2060</b><i>b </i>and allows the emitter <b>2010</b> to flush grit, debris or obstructions more effectively in the manner discussed above. In the form shown, the tips of teeth <b>2067</b><i>a</i>, <b>2067</b><i>b </i>do not overlap with one another and include a gap (e.g., 0.005&#xb1;0.002) at the pinch point <b>2060</b><i>c </i>in order to help flush grit/debris. Further dimensions regarding an exemplary PC chamber will be discussed in more detail below with respect to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>24</b>A-F</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0235" num="0232">Another embodiment of an emitter in accordance with the invention is illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>22</b>A-E</figref> and in keeping with prior practice, the following will use the same latter two-digit reference numeral to describe similar items, but use the prefix <b>21</b> to distinguish this embodiment from others. Thus, in these illustrations, the emitter is referred to general as <b>2110</b> and integrally defines an inlet <b>2130</b>, an outlet <b>2140</b> and a passage made up of a pressure reduction (PR) portion <b>2150</b> and a pressure compensation portion (PC) portion <b>2160</b> all formed from a uniform elastomeric material. Unlike the embodiment of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>21</b>A-E</figref>, emitter <b>2110</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>22</b>A-E</figref> has a consistent pressure reduction passage <b>2150</b> that serpentines back and forth, but in a less aggressive manner as that used with emitter <b>2010</b>. The emitter <b>2110</b> further includes in inlet protrusion <b>2132</b> defined by an elongated protrusion or projection extending from one end of the emitter body <b>2120</b> and outlet obstructions, such as walls <b>2141</b><i>a</i>-<i>c</i>, for preventing the outlet <b>2140</b> from collapsing under pressure when pressure increases in the lumen of the tubing to which the emitter <b>2110</b> is mounted.</p>
<p id="p-0236" num="0233">The PC portion <b>2160</b> is similar to that of the PC portion <b>2060</b> of emitter <b>2010</b>. The PC portion <b>2160</b> includes moveable floor <b>2161</b> and tapered baffles <b>2167</b><i>a</i>, <b>2167</b><i>b </i>which extend from side walls that define the PC portion <b>2160</b>. The baffles <b>2167</b><i>a</i>, <b>2167</b><i>b </i>are preferably angled upstream toward one another and the center of the PC portion <b>2160</b>, with one baffle <b>2167</b><i>a </i>extending further upstream than the other baffle <b>2167</b><i>b </i>in order to provide an additional pressure reducing turn that fluid has to make when the movable floor <b>2161</b> is moved toward the inner surface of the tube to which the emitter <b>2110</b> is mounted as fluid pressure conditions within the tube increase. Like emitter <b>2010</b>, the distal ends of baffles or teeth <b>2167</b><i>a</i>, <b>2167</b><i>b </i>form a pinch point or constriction <b>2160</b><i>c </i>through which fluid traveling through the emitter <b>2110</b> has to pass. The baffles or teeth <b>2167</b><i>a</i>, <b>2167</b><i>b </i>further separate the PC portion <b>2160</b> into an upstream portion <b>2160</b><i>a </i>and a downstream portion <b>2160</b><i>b</i>, and the upstream portion <b>2160</b><i>a </i>has an area and volume greater than the area and volume of the downstream portion <b>2160</b><i>b </i>so that more pressure is exerted on the upstream portion <b>2160</b><i>a </i>of the PC portion <b>2160</b> so as to assist with flushing grit through emitter <b>2110</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0237" num="0234">In operation, the teeth <b>2167</b><i>a</i>, <b>2167</b><i>b </i>move toward the wall of the drip line tube to which the emitter <b>2110</b> is connected as pressure of the supply fluid in the tube increases. This causes the passage over the teeth <b>2167</b><i>a</i>, <b>2167</b><i>b </i>to become smaller and, therefore, restricts flow past the teeth <b>2167</b><i>a</i>, <b>2167</b><i>b</i>. As pressure of the supply fluid in the tube decreases, the teeth <b>2167</b><i>a</i>, <b>2167</b><i>b </i>move away from the wall of the drip line tube to which the emitter is connected (e.g., away from the inner tube surface) to allow more fluid to flow through the emitter (e.g., over teeth <b>2167</b><i>a</i>, <b>2167</b><i>b</i>). In addition, one tooth extends slightly further upstream than the other in order to introduce yet another turn in the flow passage as the teeth are constricted for further pressure reduction. In the form illustrated, the emitter <b>2110</b> is configured to drip fluid at a flow rate of approximately 0.6 gallons per hour (0.6 gph).</p>
<p id="p-0238" num="0235">As mentioned previously, there is potential for obstructions, such as grit, to affect or even clog the emitter <b>2110</b>, especially at the teeth <b>2167</b><i>a</i>, <b>2167</b><i>b </i>in the pressure compensation portion or chamber <b>2160</b>. For instance, as the supply line fluid pressure increases, the teeth <b>2167</b><i>a</i>, <b>2167</b><i>b </i>move toward the inner surface of the tube creating a constriction along the top of the teeth <b>2167</b><i>a</i>, <b>2167</b><i>b </i>(as described above). There also is a constriction <b>2160</b><i>c </i>between the distal ends of the teeth <b>2167</b><i>a</i>, <b>2167</b><i>b</i>. As these constrictions form, the risk of grit clogging at the teeth <b>2167</b><i>a</i>, <b>2167</b><i>b </i>increases as does the risk for complete blockage or clogging of the emitter <b>2110</b>. Once the blockage or clogging affects the flow too much, pressure will build up on the upstream side <b>2160</b><i>a </i>of teeth <b>2167</b><i>a</i>, <b>2167</b><i>b</i>. Since the area of the floor <b>2161</b> and corresponding volume on the upstream side <b>2160</b><i>a </i>of the teeth is greater than that of the downstream side <b>2160</b><i>b</i>, the pressure will cause the floor <b>2161</b> to move away from the inside surface of the tube. This will cause the teeth <b>2167</b><i>a</i>, <b>2167</b><i>b </i>to also move away, which permits the debris forming the clog or blockage to be flushed from the pressure regulating chamber <b>2160</b>. Once the blockage or clog is flushed sufficiently, the pressure build-up on the upstream side <b>2160</b><i>a </i>of the teeth <b>2167</b><i>a</i>, <b>2167</b><i>b </i>will drop and the pressure compensating chamber <b>2160</b> will resume its normal pressure compensating function.</p>
<p id="p-0239" num="0236">In a preferred form, the walls or teeth <b>2167</b><i>a</i>, <b>2167</b><i>b </i>are angled or pointed upstream on an intersecting course from the walls from which they extend within the pressure compensating chamber <b>2160</b> in order to prevent the teeth <b>2167</b><i>a</i>, <b>2167</b><i>b </i>from forming a funnel that could get clogged more easily and frequently. This is counter-intuitive as one would normally have the teeth extend directly toward one another, or staggered but extending in opposing directions, or angled downstream to create a pressure reduction, but not a clogging point. It also is counter-intuitive in that the design used appears to form dead ends or zones at the upstream side of the base of each tooth where the tooth connects to the side wall from which it extends and could collect debris that ultimately could clog the emitter. However, applicant has found that by using this configuration the areas at the base of the teeth flush better. Further, this configuration assists to make the area and volume of the upstream side <b>2160</b><i>a </i>of the pressure compensation portion <b>2160</b> larger than the area and volume of the downstream side <b>2160</b><i>b </i>and allows the emitter <b>2110</b> to flush grit, debris or obstructions in the manner discussed above. In the form shown, the tips of teeth <b>2167</b><i>a</i>, <b>2167</b><i>b </i>do not overlap with one another and include a gap (e.g., 0.005&#xb1;0.002) at pinch point <b>2160</b><i>c </i>in order to help flush grit.</p>
<p id="p-0240" num="0237">Yet another emitter design in accordance with the invention is illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>23</b>A-E</figref> and, in keeping with prior practice regarding use of similar numbering on similar items, is referenced generally by reference numeral <b>2210</b>. In the form illustrated, emitter <b>2210</b> forms a discrete, single piece, elastomeric emitter body <b>2220</b> intended to be bonded to a portion of an inner surface of a drip line tube and integrally forming an inlet <b>2230</b>, an outlet <b>2240</b> and a flow passage extending between the inlet <b>2230</b> and outlet <b>2240</b> made up of a pressure reduction (PR) portion <b>2250</b> and a pressure compensation (PC) portion <b>2260</b>. PR portion <b>2250</b> travels in a less aggressive serpentine manner (even less aggressively than the PR portion <b>2150</b> of emitter <b>2110</b>) and has smooth walls over a portion of its distance (rather than teeth extending from the walls over the length of the PR portion). In comparison, the PR portion <b>2050</b> causes the most pressure reduction, the PR portion <b>2150</b> causes the second most pressure reduction, and this PR portion <b>2250</b> causes the least pressure reduction of the three PR portions disclosed in the embodiments of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>21</b>A-<b>23</b>F</figref>. The emitter <b>2210</b> further includes an inlet protrusion <b>2232</b> to draw cleaner (or less gritty) water from the center of the drip line and includes outlet obstructions or supports, such as walls <b>2241</b><i>a</i>-<i>c</i>, to prevent the outlet <b>2240</b> from collapsing under increased fluid line pressure.</p>
<p id="p-0241" num="0238">Like the emitter embodiments of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>21</b>A-E</figref> and <b>22</b>A-E, emitter <b>2210</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>23</b>A-E</figref> further includes a moveable floor <b>2261</b>. The exterior of the emitter body <b>2220</b> is recessed to reduce the thickness of the floor <b>2261</b> and allow the floor <b>2261</b> to move more easily and responsively to changes in fluid pressure within the tube to which the emitter is mounted. Thus, floor <b>2261</b> operates in a trampoline-like manner to move tapered baffles or walls <b>2267</b><i>a</i>, <b>2267</b><i>b </i>between a first, low fluid pressure position and a second, high fluid pressure position. The low and high fluid pressure referring to the fluid pressure of the fluid within the lumen of the drip line tube in which the emitter <b>2210</b> is mounted or affixed. The tapered baffles or walls <b>2267</b><i>a</i>, <b>2267</b><i>b </i>form a pinch point or constriction <b>2260</b><i>c </i>through which fluid must travel. The constriction further forms when the baffles <b>2267</b><i>a</i>, <b>2267</b><i>b </i>move toward their high fluid pressure position. That is, as they move toward the inner surface of the tube that the emitter is connected to as fluid pressure increases in the tube (i.e., when the floor <b>2161</b> elevates), which translates to a flow passage having a smaller cross-sectional area than the flow passage cross-sectional area when the baffles <b>2267</b><i>a</i>, <b>2267</b><i>b </i>are in their low fluid pressure position (i.e., when the floor <b>2161</b> is in its normally biased position). Baffle walls <b>2267</b><i>a</i>, <b>2267</b><i>b </i>extend from side walls defining PC portion <b>2260</b> and are angled upstream so as to divide the PC portion into a PC portion having an upstream portion <b>2260</b><i>a </i>and a downstream portion <b>2260</b><i>b</i>, with the upstream portion <b>2260</b><i>a </i>having a greater area and volume than the downstream portion <b>2260</b><i>b </i>so that more pressure is exerted against the upstream portion <b>2260</b><i>a </i>to help flush the emitter <b>2210</b> of grit.</p>
<p id="p-0242" num="0239">In operation, the teeth <b>2267</b><i>a</i>, <b>2267</b><i>b </i>move toward the wall of the drip line tube to which the emitter <b>2210</b> is connected as pressure of the supply fluid in the tube increases. This causes the passage over the teeth <b>2267</b><i>a</i>, <b>2267</b><i>b </i>to become smaller and, therefore, restricts flow past the teeth <b>2267</b><i>a</i>, <b>2267</b><i>b</i>. As pressure of the supply fluid in the tube decreases, the teeth <b>2267</b><i>a</i>, <b>2267</b><i>b </i>move away from the wall of the drip line tube to which the emitter is connected (e.g., away from the inner tube surface) to allow more fluid to flow through the emitter (e.g., over teeth <b>2267</b><i>a</i>, <b>2267</b><i>b</i>). In addition, one tooth extends slightly further upstream than the other in order to introduce yet another turn in the flow passage as the teeth are constricted for further pressure reduction. In the form illustrated, the emitter <b>2210</b> is configured to drip fluid at a flow rate of approximately 0.9 gallons per hour (0.9 gph).</p>
<p id="p-0243" num="0240">As mentioned previously, there is potential for obstructions, such as grit, to affect or even clog the emitter <b>2210</b>, especially at the teeth <b>2267</b><i>a</i>, <b>2267</b><i>b </i>in the pressure compensation portion or chamber <b>2260</b>. For instance, as the supply line fluid pressure increases, the teeth <b>2267</b><i>a</i>, <b>2267</b><i>b </i>move toward the inner surface of the tube creating a constriction along the top of the teeth <b>2267</b><i>a</i>, <b>2267</b><i>b </i>(as described above). There also is a constriction between the distal ends of the teeth <b>2267</b><i>a</i>, <b>2267</b><i>b</i>. As these constrictions form, the risk of grit clogging the edges of teeth <b>2267</b><i>a</i>, <b>2267</b><i>b </i>increases as does the risk for complete blockage or clogging of the emitter <b>2210</b>. Once the blockage or clogging affects the flow too much, pressure will build up on the upstream side <b>2260</b><i>a </i>of teeth <b>2267</b><i>a</i>, <b>2267</b><i>b</i>. Since the area of the floor <b>2261</b> on the upstream side <b>2260</b><i>a </i>of the teeth is greater than the area of the floor on the downstream side <b>2260</b><i>b</i>, the volume of the upstream portion is larger than the volume of the downstream portion and pressure will cause the floor <b>2261</b> to move away from the inside surface of the tube. This will cause the teeth <b>2267</b><i>a</i>, <b>2267</b><i>b </i>to also move away, which permits the debris forming the clog or blockage to be flushed from the pressure regulating chamber <b>2260</b>. Once the blockage or clog is flushed sufficiently, the pressure build-up on the upstream side <b>2260</b><i>a </i>of the teeth <b>2267</b><i>a</i>, <b>2267</b><i>b </i>will drop and the pressure compensating chamber <b>2260</b> will resume its normal pressure compensating function.</p>
<p id="p-0244" num="0241">In a preferred form, the walls or teeth <b>2267</b><i>a</i>, <b>2267</b><i>b </i>are angled or pointed upstream on an intersecting course from the walls from which they extend within the pressure compensating chamber <b>2260</b> in order to prevent the teeth <b>2267</b><i>a</i>, <b>2267</b><i>b </i>from forming a funnel that could get clogged more easily and frequently. This is counter-intuitive as one would normally think to have the baffles aligned or funnel downstream to assist operation of the emitter and the emitter's ability to process or handle debris/grit. It also is counter-intuitive in that the design used appears to form dead ends or zones at the upstream side of the base of each tooth where the tooth connects to the side wall from which it extends. However, applicant has found that by using this configuration the area and volume of the upstream side <b>2260</b><i>a </i>of the pressure compensation portion <b>2260</b> is capable of being made larger than that of the downstream side <b>2260</b><i>b </i>and allows the emitter <b>2210</b> to flush grit or obstructions in the manner discussed above. In the form shown, the tips of teeth <b>2267</b><i>a</i>, <b>2267</b><i>b </i>do not overlap with one another and include a gap (e.g., 0.005&#xb1;0.002) in order to help flush grit, and the teeth <b>2267</b><i>a</i>, <b>2267</b><i>b </i>form an acute angle with the respective walls they extend from on their upstream side and an obtuse angle with the respective walls they extend from on their downstream side.</p>
<p id="p-0245" num="0242">Yet another elastomeric emitter embodiment is illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>24</b>A-F</figref>. In keeping with prior practice, items that are similar to those discussed above will use the same latter two digit reference numeral but add the prefix &#x201c;23&#x201d;. Thus, the emitter is referred to generally by reference numeral <b>2310</b> and includes an emitter body <b>2320</b> made of a single piece construction and integrally forming an inlet <b>2330</b>, outlet <b>2340</b> and an internal flow passage having a pressure reduction (PR) portion <b>2350</b> and a pressure compensating (PC) portion <b>2360</b>. Like the emitter of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>21</b>, <b>22</b> and <b>23</b></figref>, the emitter of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>24</b>A-F</figref> includes an inlet protrusion <b>2332</b> that forms a perimeter wall extending about the inlet opening <b>2330</b> and helps draw fluid from a position closer to the center of the conduit or tubing within which the emitter is mounted. The PC portion <b>2360</b> has two tapered baffle teeth <b>2367</b><i>a</i>, <b>2367</b><i>b </i>that divides the PC portion <b>2360</b> into an upstream portion <b>2361</b><i>a </i>and a downstream portion <b>2361</b><i>b. </i></p>
<p id="p-0246" num="0243">In the form illustrated, the outer boundary or side walls that define the PC portion <b>2360</b> have a length of two hundred thousandths of an inch plus or minus five thousandths of an inch (0.200&#x2033;&#xb1;0.005&#x2033;) and a width of two hundred thirty two thousandths of an inch plus or minus five thousandths of an inch (0.232&#x2033;&#xb1;0.005&#x2033;), with the height of the PC portion (floor height) being twenty five thousandths of an inch plus or minus five thousandths of an inch (0.025&#x2033;&#xb1;0.005&#x2033;). The height of the PC portion is slightly smaller than the height of the PR portion which is thirty hundredths of an inch plus or minus fifteen thousandths of an inch (0.32&#x2033;&#xb1;0.015&#x2033;). This further reduces the cross-section of the flow passage from inlet <b>2330</b> to outlet <b>2340</b> and helps with pressure reduction. The teeth <b>2367</b><i>a</i>, <b>2367</b><i>b </i>have a step (e.g., gusset step) of five thousandths of an inch plus or minus two thousandths of an inch (0.005&#x2033;&#xb1;0.002&#x2033;) and taper down to a distal end height of fifteen thousandths of an inch plus or minus two thousandths of an inch (0.015&#x2033;&#xb1;0.002&#x2033;). In order to ensure the PC portion <b>2360</b> provides enough movement to compensate for fluid line pressure increases in the inner lumen of the conduit containing the emitter <b>2310</b>, the floor of the PC portion has a thickness or height of thirty thousandths of an inch plus or minus two thousandths of an inch (0.030&#x2033;&#xb1;0.002&#x2033;). Thus, the teeth <b>2367</b><i>a</i>, <b>2367</b><i>b </i>act as stepped flipper teeth that move up and down with changes in fluid line pressure to compensate for such changes.</p>
<p id="p-0247" num="0244">In the form illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>24</b>A-F</figref>, the teeth <b>2367</b><i>a</i>, <b>2367</b><i>b </i>extend from their respective side walls at an angle &#x3b1; and an angle &#x3b2;, respectively. In a preferred form, angle &#x3b1; of tooth or stepped flipper <b>2367</b><i>a </i>is fifty-two degrees (&#x3b1;=52&#xb0;), however, in alternate forms this angle may range between forty-seven degrees to fifty-seven degrees (&#x3b1;: 47&#xb0;-57&#xb0; (which is 52&#xb0;&#xb1;5&#xb0;). In still other forms, angle &#x3b1; may range between forty-two degrees and sixty-two degrees (&#x3b1;: 42&#xb0;-62&#xb0; (or 52&#xb0;&#xb1;10&#xb0;). In the form illustrated, the angle &#x3b2; that tooth or stepped flipper <b>2367</b><i>b </i>extends from the side wall of the PC portion is fifty-two degrees (&#x3b1;=60&#xb0;), however, in alternate forms this angle may range between fifty-five degrees to sixty-five degrees (&#x3b2;: 55&#xb0;-65&#xb0; (which is 60&#xb0;&#xb1;5&#xb0;). In still other forms, angle &#x3b2; may range between fifty degrees and seventy degrees (&#x3b2;: 50&#xb0;-70&#xb0; (or 60&#xb0;&#xb1;) 10&#xb0;. These angles, combined with the length of the teeth or flippers <b>2367</b><i>a</i>, <b>2367</b><i>b</i>, allow the first tooth or stepped flipper <b>2367</b><i>a </i>to extend further upstream than second tooth or stepped flipper <b>2367</b><i>b </i>in order to position the opening or pinch point <b>2360</b><i>c </i>in the middle of the PC portion <b>2360</b>. In the form illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>24</b>A-F</figref>, the opening between the teeth <b>2367</b><i>a</i>, <b>2367</b><i>b </i>is positioned in the middle of the PC pocket <b>2360</b> to obtain maximum deflection of the teeth <b>2367</b><i>a</i>, <b>2367</b><i>b</i>, which allows maximum pressure compensation.</p>
<p id="p-0248" num="0245">In the form illustrated, the upstream PC portion <b>2361</b><i>a </i>on one side of teeth <b>2367</b><i>a</i>, <b>2367</b><i>b </i>defines a first volume (e.g., a PC entrance volume or upstream volume) and the downstream PC portion on the other side of teeth <b>2367</b><i>a</i>, <b>2367</b><i>b </i>defines a second volume (e.g., the PC exit volume or downstream volume). In a preferred form, the ratio of the PC entrance volume to exit volume is within the range of twenty hundredths to fifty hundredths (0.20 to 0.50), which may also be referred to as the grit resistance ratio. In a preferred form, the ratio of the PC entrance volume to PC exit volume is between thirty five hundredths and thirty-nine hundredths (0.35 to 0.39). In the form illustrated, the ratio between the PC entrance volume to PC exit volume is thirty-seven hundredths plus or minus fifteen thousandths (0.37&#xb1;0.015). While these dimensions and ratios have only been discussed with respect to the embodiment of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>24</b>A-F</figref>, it should be understood that they may apply to any of the emitters discussed herein and, without limitation, specifically the emitters of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>21</b>-<b>24</b></figref>. Furthermore and as with earlier embodiments, it should be understood that the end views of the emitter of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>24</b>A-F</figref> have not been illustrated because these look like the end views already illustrated in prior embodiments (e.g., <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>10</b>E, <b>11</b>E</figref>, etc.).</p>
<p id="p-0249" num="0246">In the emitter of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>24</b>A-F</figref>, the outlet <b>2340</b> includes an alternate set of outlet protrusions <b>2341</b><i>a</i>, <b>2341</b><i>b </i>and <b>2341</b><i>c </i>that are used to prevent the outlet from collapsing completing under increased fluid pressure in the main tubing or conduit the emitter is mounted to or in. In prior embodiments, these outlet protrusions were either walls extending from one side wall of the outlet or free standing posts or walls, however, in the embodiment of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>24</b>A-F</figref>, the outlet protrusions <b>2341</b><i>a</i>, <b>2341</b><i>b </i>and <b>2341</b><i>c </i>are walls that extend from a first wall of the outlet <b>2340</b> to a second wall of the outlet <b>2340</b> opposite the first wall. By extending one end of the outlet to the other opposite end of the outlet, the protrusions <b>2341</b><i>a</i>, <b>2341</b><i>b </i>and <b>2341</b><i>c </i>strengthen the outlet construction and, thereby, further prevent the outlet <b>2340</b> from collapsing under high fluid pressure (which would negatively impact the emitters ability to drip fluid from the outlet as is intended for this structure).</p>
<p id="p-0250" num="0247">A prior shortcoming noted with outlet protrusions that connect directly to a side wall of the outlet <b>2340</b> is that they can form dead ends or zones that grit or debris collects in, which can ultimately prevent the emitter from operating in a preferred way (e.g., due to clogging, hindering movement, etc.). In the form illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>24</b>A-F</figref>, however, the emitter <b>2310</b> is capable of avoiding such dead end shortcomings by using an outlet wall that is shorter than the height of the outlet <b>2340</b> and, in a preferred form that has a truncated triangular cross-section (e.g., a triangular shape with the tip or top of the triangular structure removed). This structure allows the outlet protrusions <b>2341</b><i>a</i>, <b>2341</b><i>b </i>and <b>2341</b><i>c </i>to assist in strengthening the structural integrity of the outlet bath <b>2340</b> and preventing it from collapsing fully under increased fluid pressure in the inner lumen of the drip line or tubing, while still allowing grit to be flushed through the outlet bath <b>2340</b> so that the grit is not allowed to collect and interfere with the operation of the emitter <b>2310</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0251" num="0248">In the form illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>24</b>A-F</figref>, the emitter <b>2310</b> is injection molded and, thus, has a gate <b>2341</b><i>d </i>where the molten material enters the cavity of the mold. As can be seen in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>24</b>A</figref>, B, D and E, in a preferred form the gate <b>2341</b><i>d </i>is slightly higher than the height of the outlet protrusions <b>2341</b><i>a</i>, <b>2341</b><i>b </i>and <b>2341</b><i>c</i>, but lower than the height of the nearby perimeter walls of emitter <b>2310</b>. In instances where the outlet floor is movable enough to fully collapse shut against the inside surface of the tube (or collapse fully under pressure to have the floor contact the inside surface of the tube at least enough to block the outlet opening in the tube), having the gate <b>2341</b><i>d </i>be taller than the nearby outlet protrusions <b>2341</b><i>a</i>-<i>c</i>, prevents the outlet floor from being capable of such a total collapse so that the emitter continues to operate as desired. In the form shown, however, the outlet protrusions <b>2341</b><i>a</i>-<i>c </i>structurally strengthen the outlet <b>2340</b> so that such a total collapse of the outlet is not possible.</p>
<p id="p-0252" num="0249">In addition, by having the gate <b>2341</b><i>d </i>be slightly lower than the nearby perimeter walls of the outlet <b>2340</b>, this prevents the gate <b>2341</b><i>d </i>from interfering with the insertion tooling's ability to form an outlet in the outer drip line tube aligned with the outlet bath <b>2340</b> and/or prevents the gate <b>2341</b><i>d </i>from potentially blocking (partially or totally) the outlet formed in the outer drip line tubing which would prevent the emitter <b>2310</b> from operating in the intended way. For example, in some forms where the gate <b>2341</b><i>d </i>is generally equal in height with the height of the nearby perimeter walls and the outlet opening in the outer drip line tubing is aligned at least partially with the gate <b>2341</b><i>d</i>, the gate <b>2341</b><i>d </i>can at least partially obstruct the outlet opening as the floor of the outlet <b>2340</b> moves due to increased fluid pressure in the inner lumen of the drip line tube. This obstruction can be enough to cause the emitter <b>2310</b> to interfere with the normal flow of fluid from the emitter <b>2310</b>. In some examples, rather than having fluid drip from the emitter <b>2310</b> and out of the outlet formed in the outer drip line tubing as is normally desired, the obstruction caused by the gate <b>2341</b><i>d </i>can cause the fluid to squirt from the outlet opening of the outer drip line tube in an undesirable fashion. Although the outer drip line tube is not illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>24</b>A-F</figref>, it is similar to the outer drip line tube illustrated in prior embodiments (e.g., tube <b>70</b> in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b>F-H</figref>, tube <b>170</b> in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>2</b>E-F</figref>, tube <b>270</b> in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b>A</figref>, tube <b>970</b> in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>10</b>E</figref>, etc.).</p>
<p id="p-0253" num="0250">While a cross-section of the emitter of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>24</b>A-F</figref> taken along the longitudinal axis of same has been illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>24</b>E</figref>, it should be understood that the cross-sections of the emitters of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>21</b>A-<b>23</b>D</figref> would look similar at least with respect to floor thickness, and PR, PC and outlet size. Although the floor of the remainder of the flow passage (e.g., pressure reduction portion) and the outlet illustrated in that cross-sectional view is illustrated as rather thick, in alternate embodiments moveable floors of different thickness may be used to achieve the amount of floor deformation under pressure that is desired to compensate for fluid pressure increases in the supply line or main lumen of the tube. For example, in some forms, a thinner floor may be desired like that illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>19</b>B</figref> (see floor <b>1861</b>).</p>
<p id="p-0254" num="0251">In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>25</b>A-B</figref> and <b>26</b>, elastomeric emitters like any of those discussed herein are illustrated. In keeping with prior practice, items that are similar to those discussed above will use the same latter two-digit reference numeral and including the prefix &#x201c;24&#x201d; for the embodiment of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>25</b>A-B</figref> and &#x201c;25&#x201d; for the embodiment of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>26</b></figref>. Thus, the emitters of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>25</b>A-B</figref> and <b>26</b> are referred to generally by reference numerals <b>2410</b> and <b>2510</b>, respectively, and respectively have bodies <b>2420</b>, <b>2520</b> that integrally form inlets <b>2430</b>, <b>2530</b>, outlets <b>2440</b>, <b>2540</b>, pressure reduction flow passages <b>2450</b>, <b>2550</b> and pressure compensating flow passages <b>2460</b>, <b>2560</b>. Unlike prior embodiments, however, emitters <b>2410</b> and <b>2510</b> further include at least one protrusion extending from an exterior surface of the emitter <b>2410</b>, <b>2510</b> which assists in the removal of the emitter from the injection molding mold and/or the transport of the emitter through emitter insertion tooling.</p>
<p id="p-0255" num="0252">In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>25</b>A-B</figref>, the emitter <b>2410</b> includes a plurality of such protrusions and the protrusions, are spaced apart from the inlet <b>2430</b> of the emitter <b>2410</b> on the bottom surface of the emitter body <b>2420</b> on the emitter body side opposite the side containing the flow passages <b>2450</b> and <b>2460</b> and outlet <b>2440</b>. In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>25</b>A-B</figref> the plurality of protrusions are illustrated as convex nubs or round (or rounded) protrusions <b>2421</b><i>a</i>, <b>2421</b><i>b</i>, <b>2421</b><i>c</i>, <b>2421</b><i>d</i>, <b>2421</b><i>e</i>, <b>2421</b><i>f</i>, <b>2421</b><i>g </i>and <b>2421</b><i>h</i>. The protrusions are aligned with four on one side of the bottom surface of the emitter and the other four on the opposite side of the bottom surface of the emitter such that the protrusion pattern is laid out in a symmetrical orientation. In a preferred form, four protrusions are spaced around the perimeter of each ejector location <b>2420</b><i>c </i>and <b>2420</b><i>d </i>for the emitter <b>2410</b>. The ejector locations <b>2420</b><i>c</i>, <b>2420</b><i>d </i>are the area where the injection mold tooling will press on to eject the emitter from the mold.</p>
<p id="p-0256" num="0253">In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>26</b></figref>, an alternate protrusion construction is illustrated. More particularly, in this embodiment, a plurality of protrusions is again used, however, in this form, only two protrusions are illustrated and they are aligned with the ejection areas of the emitter. In this form, the ejector locations are identical to those identified in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>25</b>A-B</figref> (e.g., <b>2420</b><i>c</i>, <b>2420</b><i>d</i>) and the protrusions <b>2521</b><i>a</i>, <b>2521</b><i>b </i>correspond in shape to the ejector locations (meaning the diameters of the protrusions <b>2521</b><i>a</i>, <b>2521</b><i>b </i>are the same size as the circles <b>2420</b><i>c</i>, <b>2420</b><i>d </i>illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>25</b>B</figref>). Thus, in this form the protrusions <b>2521</b><i>a</i>, <b>2521</b><i>b </i>are round convex (preferably semi-spherical) dimples protruding from the bottom surface of emitter body <b>2520</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0257" num="0254">The protrusions <b>2421</b><i>a</i>-<i>h </i>and <b>2521</b><i>a</i>-<i>b </i>may assist in removing the emitter from the injection tooling mold, but a primary benefit of these protrusions is to help reduce the frictional surface area of the emitter <b>2410</b>, <b>2510</b> so that the emitter is easier to transport through the insertion tooling. For example, such protrusions reduce the frictional surface area of the emitter as it is moved from a feeder bowl to an inserter via a conveyor of some form (e.g., conveyor belt, conveyor chain, etc.).</p>
<p id="p-0258" num="0255">While many of the above-mentioned embodiments illustrate the tapered baffles of the PC portion extending from separate side walls and angled toward one another or on a path to intersect one another, it should be understood that in alternate embodiments the tapered baffles could extend from the same side wall of the PC portion and/or could extend out from a wall or walls parallel to one another in non-intersecting paths. It should also be understood that one or more features from any one of the above mentioned embodiments may be combined with one or more features from any other embodiment to come up with still other embodiments. For example, a root growth inhibitor, such as a copper plate, and associated retaining structure could be added to any of the emitters of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>21</b>A-<b>26</b></figref>. Similarly, although specific layouts have been illustrated, it is to be understood that in further alternate embodiments the layouts may be changed while still following the teachings of the illustrated embodiments to achieve new embodiments (such as to reach a desired flow rate, pressure reduction, pressure compensation or grit tolerance).</p>
<p id="p-0259" num="0256">Yet another embodiment in accordance with the invention is illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>27</b>A-J</figref> and, in keeping with prior numbering practice, is referred generally by reference numeral <b>2610</b>. Like prior embodiments, the emitter <b>2610</b> is made of an elastomeric body <b>2620</b> and integrally defines an inlet <b>2630</b>, outlet bath <b>2640</b> and a flow channel extending between the inlet <b>2620</b> and outlet bath <b>2640</b> having a pressure reduction portion <b>2650</b> and a pressure compensating portion <b>2660</b>. In a preferred form, the inlet <b>2630</b> includes an inlet protrusion <b>2632</b> comprising a perimeter inlet wall that defines an inlet channel terminating at the pressure reduction flow channel <b>2650</b>, and the outlet bath <b>2640</b> includes a plurality of shortened outlet walls <b>2641</b><i>a</i>, <b>2641</b><i>b </i>and <b>2641</b><i>c </i>which strengthen the outlet and help flush grit and/or hinder grit buildup as discussed in prior embodiments (e.g., <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>24</b>A-F</figref>). In the form illustrated, the outlet bath <b>2640</b> also includes a reduced height gate <b>2641</b><i>d </i>which is lower than the surrounding outlet perimeter walls to prevent the above-mentioned complications when the outlet is formed in the outer tubing of the assembled drip line and emitter.</p>
<p id="p-0260" num="0257">Unlike prior embodiments, however, the emitter <b>2610</b> includes a pressure reduction passage <b>2650</b>, pressure compensating passage <b>2660</b> and outlet bath <b>2640</b> that are all at different depths (e.g., have passage floor surfaces of different depths) or on different planes (e.g., not coplanar with one another). As best seen in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>27</b>C and <b>27</b>E</figref>, the pressure reduction passage <b>2650</b> has a first depth, the pressure compensating passage <b>2660</b> has a second depth different than the first depth and the outlet bath has a third depth different than either the first or second depths. In a preferred form, the first depth is smaller than the second depth and third depth and the third depth is smaller than the second depth. Another way of stating this is that the surface of the pressure reduction passage <b>2650</b> floor is in a first plane, the surface of the pressure compensating passage <b>2660</b> floor is in a second plane and the surface of the outlet bath <b>2640</b> is in a third plane and none of the first, second and third planes are coplanar with one another. Rather, the first plane and third plane are located on one side of the second plane, but neither the first plane nor the third plane are coplanar with one another.</p>
<p id="p-0261" num="0258">In the form illustrated in the figures (and as best seen in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>27</b>F</figref>), the pressure compensating portion <b>2660</b> is capable of having the largest depth to its floor passage surface because no recess is formed in the bottom of the emitter body <b>2620</b> (as has been shown in prior embodiments). Thus, the first side of the emitter body <b>2620</b> defines the open face of the emitter and the side defining at least a portion of the inlet <b>2630</b>, outlet bath <b>2640</b> and flow passage extending therebetween, and the second side of the emitter body <b>2620</b> (located opposite the first side) forms a generally flat opposite side of the emitter body <b>2620</b> with the exception of the perimeter wall of the inlet protrusion <b>2632</b> extending therefrom (if and when such a structure is present). In a preferred form, the inlet protrusion <b>2632</b> is centrally located on a distal end of the emitter body <b>2620</b> and formed of a rounded perimeter wall that solely defines the inlet protrusion <b>2632</b> of the emitter <b>2610</b> and no other part of the emitter, however, as has been mentioned above, the protrusion <b>2632</b> can be positioned elsewhere on the body <b>2620</b> and/or may not even be included (in which case the entire bottom or second side of the emitter body will be generally flat and/or coplanar). However, in the embodiment illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>27</b>F</figref>, the inlet <b>2630</b> is located on a first side of the emitter body <b>2620</b> and the outlet bath <b>2640</b> is located on a second side of the emitter body and the emitter body <b>2620</b> further defines an inlet protrusion <b>2632</b> extending from the first side of the emitter body <b>2620</b> and forming a perimeter wall <b>2632</b> about the inlet that defines an inlet channel <b>2631</b> and the remainder of the first side of the emitter body <b>2620</b> is devoid of further protrusions or recesses.</p>
<p id="p-0262" num="0259">Another difference in emitter <b>2610</b> as compared to prior embodiments is the at least one baffle <b>2667</b> positioned on the movable floor <b>2661</b> of the pressure compensation portion <b>2660</b>. The pressure compensating chamber <b>2660</b> is positioned between the pressure reducing flow channel <b>2650</b> and the outlet bath <b>2640</b> to receive fluid from the pressure reducing flow channel <b>2650</b>. The chamber <b>2660</b> being defined by moveable floor <b>2661</b> and at least one tapered baffle <b>2667</b> that separates the pressure compensating chamber into an upstream portion <b>2660</b><i>a </i>and a downstream portion <b>2660</b><i>b</i>. In the form illustrated, the downstream portion <b>2660</b><i>b </i>is defined by an inner flow passage formed by the at least one tapered baffle <b>2667</b> through which the fluid travels through when transitioning from the upstream portion <b>2660</b><i>a </i>to the outlet bath <b>2640</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0263" num="0260">Thus, in the form illustrated, the irrigation drip emitter <b>2610</b> forms an emitter for attachment to only a portion of an inner circumference of an inner surface of an irrigation drip line tube and includes a discrete elastomeric emitter body <b>2620</b> integrally defining: an inlet <b>2630</b> for receiving pressurized fluid from the tube; an outlet bath <b>2640</b> for discharging the fluid from the body <b>2620</b>; a pressure reducing flow channel <b>2650</b> extending from the inlet <b>2630</b> for reducing a pressure and flow of fluid received at the inlet <b>2630</b>, and a pressure compensating chamber <b>2660</b> positioned between the pressure reducing flow channel <b>2650</b> and the outlet bath <b>2640</b> to receive fluid from the pressure reducing flow channel <b>2650</b>, the chamber <b>2660</b> being defined by a moveable floor <b>2661</b> and at least one tapered baffle <b>2667</b> that separates the pressure compensating chamber <b>2660</b> into an upstream portion <b>2660</b><i>a </i>and a downstream portion <b>2660</b><i>b </i>formed by an inner flow passage defined by the at least one tapered baffle <b>2667</b> through which the fluid travels from the upstream portion <b>2660</b><i>a </i>to the outlet bath <b>2640</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0264" num="0261">In one embodiment, the at least one tapered baffle <b>2667</b> has two tapering side portions <b>2667</b><i>a </i>and <b>2667</b><i>b </i>and defines a recess, such as metering groove <b>2667</b><i>c</i>, which forms the pinch point <b>2660</b><i>c </i>between the upstream portion <b>2660</b><i>a </i>and downstream portion <b>2660</b><i>b </i>(as discussed with prior embodiments herein). In a preferred form, the two tapering side portions <b>2667</b><i>a</i>, <b>2667</b><i>b </i>are connected to one another at a distal end thereof to form a generally U-shaped or V-shaped structure with a recess <b>2667</b><i>c </i>to allow fluid to flow from the upstream portion <b>2660</b><i>a </i>to the downstream portion <b>2660</b><i>b </i>formed by the inner flow passage defined by the at least one tapered baffle <b>2667</b>. In some forms, the upstream portion <b>2660</b><i>a </i>and downstream portion <b>2660</b><i>b </i>have respective volumes and the recess <b>2667</b><i>c </i>is generally located in the distal end of the at least one tapered baffle <b>2667</b> and the recess <b>2667</b><i>c </i>defines a recess volume (or pinch point volume) that is smaller than both the upstream portion volume and the downstream portion volume of the pressure compensation chamber <b>2660</b>. In the embodiment illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>27</b>A-J</figref>, the tapering walls <b>2667</b><i>a</i>, <b>2667</b><i>b </i>terminate in the distal end that has a generally circular diameter of constant height with the exception of the recess <b>2667</b><i>c </i>and internal flow passage <b>2660</b><i>b</i>.

<p id="p-0265" num="0262">Another way of stating the above is that the pressure reducing flow channel <b>2650</b> has a first volume and/or cross-sectional area, and the pressure compensating chamber <b>2660</b> has a second volume and/or cross-sectional area that is larger than the first volume and/or cross-sectional area of the pressure reducing flow channel <b>2650</b>. Alternatively, it can be stated with respect to the passage depths as mentioned above. In some forms, the pressure reducing flow channel <b>2650</b> has first and second side walls connected to one another via a first transverse wall (e.g., floor <b>2650</b><i>a</i>) and the pressure compensating chamber <b>2660</b> has side walls or one or more perimeter walls <b>2660</b><i>d </i>connected via a second transverse wall or floor <b>2661</b> and the second transverse wall <b>2661</b> is positioned at a depth from the top of the emitter <b>2610</b> different than the first transverse wall <b>2650</b><i>a </i>so that the second volume and/or cross-sectional area of the pressure compensation chamber <b>2660</b> is larger than the first volume and/or cross-sectional area of the pressure reduction passage <b>2650</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0266" num="0263">In some embodiments, the first and second perimeter walls are separated by the egress defined by the pressure compensation chamber <b>2660</b> (and specifically the perimeter wall <b>2660</b><i>d</i>) where fluid flows from the pressure compensation chamber <b>2660</b> to the outlet bath <b>2640</b>. Thus, the pressure reducing flow channel <b>2650</b> has a pressure reducing flow channel floor <b>2650</b><i>a </i>of a first depth and the pressure compensation chamber <b>2660</b> has a moveable floor <b>2661</b> of a second depth that is deeper than the first depth. In a preferred form, the emitter body <b>2620</b> has an emitter body height and the first depth associated with the pressure reducing flow channel <b>2650</b> is less than fifty percent the emitter body height at the pressure reducing flow channel <b>2650</b> and the second depth of the pressure compensation chamber <b>2660</b> is greater than fifty percent the emitter body height at the pressure compensation chamber <b>2660</b>. For example, in one form, the first depth of the pressure reduction portion <b>2650</b> is less than twenty-five percent the emitter body height at the pressure reducing flow channel <b>2650</b> and the second depth of the pressure compensating chamber <b>2660</b> is greater than seventy-five percent the emitter body height at the pressure compensation chamber <b>2660</b>.</p>

<p id="p-0269" num="0266">As with prior embodiments discussed above, the emitter of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>27</b>A-J</figref> is intended to be mounted inside of a drip line tube at regular intervals therein in order to form irrigation drip line or drip line tubing. Thus, in addition to emitter <b>2610</b>, there is contemplated herein an irrigation drip line tube including a tube having an inner surface and an outer surface with the inner surface defining an inner circumference of the tube, and a plurality of discrete elastomeric emitters <b>2610</b> connected to only a portion of the inner circumference of the inner surface of the tube and at regular intervals therein. In a preferred form, each elastomeric emitter body <b>2620</b> integrally defining: an inlet <b>2630</b> for receiving pressurized fluid from the tube; an outlet bath <b>2640</b> for discharging the fluid from the body <b>2620</b>; a pressure reducing flow channel <b>2650</b> extending from the inlet <b>2630</b> for reducing a pressure and flow of fluid received at the inlet, and a pressure compensating chamber <b>2660</b> positioned between the pressure reducing flow channel <b>2650</b> and the outlet bath <b>2640</b> to receive fluid from the pressure reducing flow channel <b>2650</b>, the chamber <b>2660</b> being defined by a moveable floor <b>2661</b> and at least one tapered baffle <b>2667</b> that separates the pressure compensating chamber <b>2660</b> into an upstream portion <b>2660</b><i>a </i>and a downstream portion <b>2660</b><i>b </i>formed by an inner flow passage defined by the at least one tapered baffle <b>2667</b> through which the fluid travels from the upstream portion to the outlet bath <b>2640</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0270" num="0267">In yet other embodiments of the invention and as has been discussed herein with respect to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>16</b>A-B</figref> and <b>17</b>A-B, it may be desirable to form an emitter out of two different materials to assist with transporting the emitter during the drip line manufacturing process and/or the bonding of the emitter to the extruded tubing to form the desired irrigation drip line. For example, another embodiment of the invention is the poly-material emitter illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>28</b>A-J</figref>. In keeping with prior practice, similar latter two digit reference numerals will be used for items that are similar to those discussed in prior embodiments, but adding a prefix of &#x201c;27&#x201d; to the two-digit reference numeral to distinguish one embodiment from others. Thus, in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>28</b>A-J</figref>, the emitter is referred to generally as emitter <b>2710</b> and includes a body <b>2720</b> defining an inlet <b>2730</b>, outlet bath <b>2740</b> and flow path extending therebetween. However, unlike prior embodiments, in the form illustrated, the body only defines the pressure reduction portion <b>2750</b> of the flow passage and is made of a polyethylene instead of a thermoplastic elastomeric component (e.g., TPO). In this embodiment, only the pressure compensating chamber <b>2760</b> is made of a thermoplastic elastomeric component (e.g., TPO). In this way, the majority of the emitter <b>2710</b> is made of a more rigid and easily transportable and bondable polyethylene material and only a small portion is made of an elastomeric material (which tends to be harder to transport throughout insertion tooling or machinery and which tends to be harder to bond repeatedly to extruded tubing.</p>
<p id="p-0271" num="0268">In a preferred form the polyethylene body <b>2720</b> and thermoplastic elastomeric chamber <b>2760</b> are formed in a two-shot molding process and in a way that the thermoplastic elastomeric chamber <b>2760</b> chemically bonds to the rigid polyethylene material without the need for interlocking features or cross-linking between the two distinct materials. In other forms, the emitter <b>2710</b> may be formed in separate steps, such as by having the elastomeric pressure compensating portion or chamber <b>2760</b> formed separately and inserted or disposed into a socket or seat <b>2720</b><i>c </i>defined by the rigid polyethylene body <b>2720</b>. In some forms, the rigid body <b>2720</b> may further be formed with an inlet protrusion <b>2732</b> similar to those discussed in prior embodiments that defines an inlet channel <b>2731</b> terminating in and in fluid communication with the pressure reduction portion <b>2750</b> of emitter <b>2710</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0272" num="0269">Regardless of the manufacturing process used, the body <b>2720</b> will preferably define a seat <b>2720</b><i>c </i>having at least one supporting surface upon which the pressure compensating portion <b>2760</b> will be nested or supported.

The seat <b>2720</b><i>c </i>will further define an inner opening that allows at least a portion of the bottom surface of the movable floor <b>2761</b> of the pressure compensation member <b>2760</b> to be exposed to fluid traveling through the drip line so that the fluid traveling in the drip line can move the movable floor <b>2761</b> and cause the pressure compensating member <b>2760</b> to compensate for increases or decreased in the fluid supply line pressure. In the form illustrated, the seat <b>2720</b><i>c </i>is formed such that it only overlaps with a minimal portion of the pressure compensating member <b>2760</b> and the opening defined by the seat <b>2720</b><i>c </i>is centrally located within the body <b>2720</b> and leaves exposed a majority of the bottom surface of the pressure compensating member <b>2760</b> (e.g., greater than 90% of the bottom surface of the pressure compensating member <b>2760</b> remains exposed).</p>

The elastomeric pressure compensating member <b>2860</b> integrally defines a flexible floor <b>2861</b> and side walls <b>2860</b><i>d </i>extending substantially about a perimeter of the flexible floor <b>2861</b> and including an ingress opening or portion <b>2860</b><i>e </i>and an egress opening or portion <b>2860</b><i>f</i>, and at least one tapering baffle that separates the flexible floor <b>2861</b> and pressure compensating member <b>2860</b> into an upstream portion <b>2860</b><i>a </i>and a downstream portion <b>2860</b><i>b</i>. In the preferred form illustrated, the at least one tapering baffle includes first tapering baffle <b>2867</b><i>a </i>and second tapering baffle <b>2867</b><i>b</i>, with the first tapering baffle <b>2867</b><i>a </i>extending further toward the center of the movable floor <b>2861</b> than the second tapering baffle <b>2867</b><i>b </i>(e.g., the first tapering baffle <b>2867</b><i>a </i>extending further upstream than the second tapering baffle <b>2867</b><i>b</i>). Both the upstream portion <b>2860</b><i>a </i>and downstream portion <b>2860</b><i>b </i>have respective volumes or cross-sectional areas and the volume or cross-sectional area of the upstream portion is preferably made larger than the volume or cross-sectional area of the downstream portion to assist the pressure compensating member <b>2860</b> in flushing grit through the emitter <b>2810</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0279" num="0276">In the form illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>29</b>A-H</figref>, the seat <b>2820</b><i>c </i>of the rigid emitter body <b>2820</b> is defined by a step or shelf formed in the rigid emitter body and at least a portion of the pressure compensating member is rested on the step or shelf <b>2820</b>. As with at least one prior embodiment the side walls of the pressure compensating member <b>2860</b> will rest above the seat <b>2820</b><i>c </i>and include first, second, third and fourth side walls positioned in a generally rectangular orientation, with the first and second side walls positioned parallel to one another and having a generally flat upper surface, and the third and fourth side walls positioned parallel to one another and being generally transverse to the first and second side walls, with the third and fourth side walls having a curved upper surface with a first radius of curvature that corresponds to an interior surface of an irrigation drip tube. The flexible floor <b>2861</b> has a first side upon which the at least one tapering baffle is connected (e.g., first baffle <b>2867</b><i>a </i>and second baffle <b>2867</b><i>b</i>), and a second side located opposite the first side, and wherein the flexible floor <b>2861</b> is shaped so as to be concave on the second side and convex on the first side. The first side of flexible floor <b>2861</b> having a second radius of curvature that corresponds in shape to the first radius of curvature of the upper surfaces of the third and fourth side walls so as to give the flow passages of the emitter a generally uniform cross-section despite the curvature of the inner tube surface to which the emitter <b>2810</b> is connected.</p>
<p id="p-0280" num="0277">Again, as best illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>29</b>B and <b>29</b>H</figref>, the first, second, third and fourth side walls of pressure compensating member <b>2860</b> extend above the first side of the flexible floor <b>2861</b> and terminate in the generally flat upper surfaces of the first and second side walls and the generally curved upper surfaces of the third and fourth side walls. In addition, the first, second, third and fourth side walls of pressure compensating member <b>2860</b> further extend below the second side of the flexible floor <b>2861</b> and terminate in generally flat and coplanar bottom surfaces designed to rest at least partially on seat <b>2820</b><i>c </i>of rigid emitter body <b>2820</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0281" num="0278">The pressure compensating member <b>2860</b> further defines a protruding portion proximate at least one of the ingress opening and/or the egress opening. In the form illustrated, the pressure compensating member <b>2860</b> has a first ingress protruding portion <b>2860</b><i>e </i>proximate the ingress opening of the pressure compensating member <b>2860</b> and a second egress protruding portion <b>2860</b><i>f </i>proximate the egress opening of the pressure compensating member <b>2860</b>. In the illustrated form, the ingress and egress protrusions <b>2860</b><i>e</i>, <b>2860</b><i>f </i>protrude or extend out beyond a boundary defined by the perimeter or side walls <b>2860</b><i>d </i>of pressure compensating member <b>2860</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0282" num="0279">As with the prior embodiment of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>28</b>A-J</figref>, pressure compensation member <b>2860</b> includes side walls <b>2860</b><i>d </i>having at least a first side wall and a second side wall and the at least one tapering baffle comprises a first tapering baffle <b>2867</b><i>a </i>extending from the first side wall and a second tapering baffle <b>2867</b><i>b </i>extending from the second side wall, with the first and second tapering baffles <b>2867</b><i>a</i>, <b>2867</b><i>b </i>extending toward a center of the flexible floor and toward one another to define the upstream portion <b>2860</b><i>a </i>and downstream portion <b>2860</b><i>b </i>of the pressure compensating member. As mentioned, the first tapering baffle <b>2867</b><i>a </i>extends further toward the center of the flexible floor <b>2861</b> than the second tapering baffle <b>2867</b><i>b</i>. The first tapering baffle <b>2867</b><i>a </i>extends upstream than the second tapering baffle <b>2867</b><i>b</i>. In this form, the baffles <b>2867</b><i>a</i>, <b>2867</b><i>b </i>extend generally from corner regions of the pressure compensation member <b>2860</b> and on opposite sides of the pressure compensation member, however, it should be understood that in alternate embodiments the baffles could extend from a common wall or from corners that are not only on opposite sides of the pressure compensation member <b>2860</b>, but also that are kitty or catty corner to one another (e.g., diagonal from one another).</p>
<p id="p-0283" num="0280">Turning now to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>30</b>A-H</figref>, an improved emitter outlet and emitter with such outlet are disclosed. In keeping with prior practice, items in this embodiment that are similar to those discussed above, will use the same latter two-digit reference numeral but add the prefix <b>29</b> to distinguish one embodiment from the other. Thus, the emitter is referred to generally by reference number <b>2910</b> and includes a body <b>2920</b> having an inlet <b>2930</b> and an outlet (or outlet bath) <b>2940</b> interconnected via a pressure reduction flow passage portion <b>2950</b> and a pressure compensating flow passage portion <b>2960</b>. Fluid enters the emitter through inlet <b>2930</b> (specifically inlet protrusion <b>2932</b>), flows through pressure reduction flow passage portion <b>2950</b>, then into pressure compensation flow passage portion <b>2960</b> and finally into outlet <b>2940</b>. As has been mentioned above, in some instances, fluid flowing through the emitter can cause an undesirable squirting fluid pattern from the emitter (particularly when the outlet opening formed in the drip line adjacent the outlet <b>2940</b> is not positioned correctly). Squirting means that the emitter is not operating with the desired drip or flow pattern egressing from the emitter and/or drip line outlet.</p>
<p id="p-0284" num="0281">This problem has been addressed at least in part by designing outlet <b>2940</b> to create additional reductions in fluid velocity at outlet <b>2940</b>. More particularly, in the form illustrated, an emitter outlet body defines an ingress channel <b>2940</b><i>a </i>having a first volume and area, and having a first portion <b>2940</b><i>aa </i>that is substantially perpendicular to a second portion <b>2940</b><i>ab </i>located downstream of the first portion <b>2940</b><i>aa </i>which causes fluid flowing through the ingress channel <b>2940</b><i>a </i>to make a first fluid velocity reducing turn. The outlet <b>2940</b> further defines a first opening <b>2940</b><i>b </i>located off of the second portion <b>2940</b><i>ab </i>that causes at least a portion of the fluid flowing through the ingress channel to make a second fluid velocity reducing turn. In the form illustrated, the outlet bath <b>2940</b><i>d </i>has a second volume and area that is larger than the first volume and area of the ingress channel <b>2940</b><i>a </i>so as to cause further pressure and/or velocity reduction of the fluid entering into the outlet bath <b>2940</b><i>d. </i></p>
<p id="p-0285" num="0282">In a preferred form, the irrigation drip emitter outlet <b>2940</b> of emitter <b>29410</b> further includes a second opening <b>2940</b><i>c </i>located off of the second portion <b>2940</b><i>ab </i>of the ingress channel <b>29440</b><i>a </i>further downstream than the first opening <b>2940</b><i>b </i>that causes at least a portion of the fluid flowing through the ingress channel <b>2940</b><i>a </i>to make a third fluid velocity reducing turn. The outlet bath <b>2940</b><i>d </i>is defined by at least three side walls <b>2940</b><i>e</i>, <b>2940</b><i>f </i>and <b>2940</b><i>g </i>and the outlet bath further includes a protrusion, such as rib <b>2941</b>, having first and second ends <b>2941</b><i>a</i>, <b>2941</b><i>b</i>, with the first end of the rib <b>2941</b><i>a </i>connected to one of the sidewalls <b>2940</b><i>e</i>-<i>g </i>defining at least a portion of the outlet bath <b>2940</b><i>d </i>and the second end of the rib <b>2941</b><i>b </i>separating the first opening <b>2940</b><i>b </i>and second opening <b>2940</b><i>c </i>off of the ingress channel <b>2940</b><i>a</i>. The rib <b>2941</b> has an intermediate portion <b>2941</b><i>c </i>located between the first and second ends <b>2941</b><i>a</i>, <b>2941</b><i>b </i>of the rib <b>2941</b> which is recessed to allow the fluid flowing through the outlet bath <b>2940</b><i>d </i>from the first and second openings <b>2940</b><i>b</i>, <b>2940</b><i>c </i>to flow over the rib <b>2941</b>. The recess in the intermediate portion of the rib <b>2941</b><i>c </i>is formed by a plurality of steps <b>2941</b><i>d</i>, <b>2941</b><i>e </i>located proximate the second end of the rib <b>2941</b><i>b</i>. In the form shown, the recess formed by intermediate portion <b>2941</b><i>c </i>is 0.125&#x2033; to 0.135&#x2033; lower than a remaining higher portion of the rib <b>2941</b> (particularly ends <b>2941</b><i>a</i>, <b>2941</b><i>b</i>). This configuration allows the outlet opening to be made over a very broad area of the drip line tube and with the velocity reducing features of the outlet shown the outlet opening can be made over this broad area of the drip line tube proximate the emitter outlet <b>2940</b> without negatively impacting the desired fluid flow pattern of the emitter <b>2910</b>. The configuration show may even allow for larger emitter outlet openings to be formed in the drip line without negatively impacting the operation of the emitter or drip line.</p>
<p id="p-0286" num="0283">As best seen in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>30</b>A and <b>30</b>E</figref>, the outlet bath <b>2940</b><i>d </i>includes a floor <b>2940</b><i>h </i>and side walls <b>2940</b><i>e</i>-<i>g </i>and the floor <b>2940</b><i>h </i>is recessed into the bath <b>2940</b><i>d </i>as compared to the floor of the pressure compensation portion <b>2961</b> and at the start of the ingress channel <b>2940</b><i>a</i>. The recessed floor <b>2940</b><i>h </i>helps ensure the second volume and area of the bath <b>2940</b><i>d </i>is larger than the first volume and area of ingress channel <b>2940</b><i>a</i>. In the form shown, the second portion <b>2940</b><i>ab </i>of ingress channel <b>2940</b><i>a </i>is actually recessed as compared to the first portion <b>2940</b><i>aa </i>of ingress channel <b>2940</b><i>a </i>and this too is to assist with velocity reductions and/or pressure drops with respect to the fluid flowing through the ingress channel <b>2940</b><i>a</i>. In a preferred form, this transition to a more sunken ingress passageway will occur between the first portion <b>2940</b><i>aa </i>and second portion <b>2940</b><i>ab. </i></p>
<p id="p-0287" num="0284">In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>30</b>A-G</figref>, the first fluid velocity reducing turn that occurs at the transition from the first portion <b>4940</b><i>aa </i>of ingress channel <b>4940</b><i>a </i>to the second portion <b>4940</b><i>ab </i>and the second fluid velocity reducing turns that occurs at first opening <b>2940</b><i>b </i>are in different directions. More particularly, the first fluid velocity reducing turn and second fluid velocity reducing turns are in opposite directions (e.g., the first turns right as you look from downstream and above and the second turns left as looking from downstream and above). In the form shown, the second and third fluid velocity reducing turns are in a common direction (e.g., both left as viewed from downstream and above) and the first fluid velocity reducing turn is in a different direction than the second and third fluid velocity reducing turns (e.g., the first fluid velocity reducing turn is to the right as viewed from downstream and above).</p>
<p id="p-0288" num="0285">In addition to disclosing an emitter outlet herein, it should also be understood than entire emitters are disclosed herein that may use such an outlet. For example, any one of the emitters illustrated herein from <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>1</b>A-<b>29</b>H</figref> could also be configured with the outlet of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>30</b>A-H</figref>. The irrigation drip emitter <b>2910</b> would include an inlet <b>2930</b>, a pressure reducing flow passage portion <b>2950</b>, and an outlet <b>2940</b> as discussed above. In a preferred form, the emitter <b>2910</b> would also include a pressure compensating flow passage portion <b>2960</b>. In some forms, the emitter may be an in-line emitter and in others it may be an on-line emitter. In a preferred form, the emitter will be a discrete in-line emitter (e.g., cylindrical, flat, etc.), and in some forms will actually be a discrete elastomeric emitter made out of a unitary piece of elastomer. It should be understood, however, that the fluid velocity reducing outlet disclosed herein could be used in a variety of emitter types as may be desired.</p>
<p id="p-0289" num="0286">In operation, the inlet <b>2930</b>, pressure reduction flow passage portion <b>2950</b>, pressure compensation flow passage portion <b>2960</b> and outlet <b>2940</b> are all in fluid communication with one another and the outlet <b>2940</b> further reduces the fluid velocity by going through the turns of ingress channel <b>2940</b><i>a </i>and through openings <b>2940</b><i>b </i>and <b>2940</b><i>c</i>, as well as the movement from smaller volume and area structures (e.g., like the PC portion <b>2960</b>) to larger volume and area structures (e.g., like bath <b>2940</b><i>d</i>). In a preferred form, the inlet <b>2930</b> will be upstream of all other emitter components, followed by the pressure reduction portion <b>2950</b>, then the pressure compensating portion <b>2960</b> and eventually the outlet <b>2940</b>. In the form shown, the ingress channel <b>2940</b><i>a </i>is located upstream of the bath <b>2940</b><i>d </i>and feeds fluid to the first and second openings <b>2940</b><i>b</i>, <b>2940</b><i>c </i>which are located downstream from the first portion <b>2940</b><i>aa </i>of the ingress channel <b>2940</b><i>a. </i></p>
<p id="p-0290" num="0287">In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>30</b>A-H</figref>, the emitter <b>2910</b> is made entirely of elastomeric material comprising a unitary discrete elastomeric emitter body <b>2920</b> integrally defining the inlet <b>2930</b>, pressure reducing flow passage portion <b>2950</b>, pressure compensating flow passage portion <b>2960</b> and outlet <b>2940</b>. In a preferred form, a plurality of such emitters <b>2910</b> will be bonded at regularly spaced intervals to the inner surface of a drip line tube, with each irrigation drip emitter having a corresponding outlet opening in the drip line tube proximate the outlet of each irrigation drip emitter to allow fluid to flow from the drip line, into the emitter inlet <b>2930</b>, through passages <b>2950</b>, <b>2960</b> and outlet <b>2940</b> and eventually through the opening made in the drip line tubing to allow fluid to drip out of the emitter and drip line as desired.</p>
<p id="p-0291" num="0288"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>31</b>A-B</figref> are illustrated graphs showing actual fluid velocity data for an emitter with an outlet configured as in the embodiment of outlet <b>2340</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>24</b>A-F</figref> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>31</b>A</figref>) and fluid velocity data for an emitter with an outlet configured as in the embodiment of outlet <b>2940</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>29</b>A-H</figref> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>31</b>B</figref>). As is illustrated, the outlet <b>2940</b> in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>31</b>B</figref> has an initially higher fluid velocity at the ingress channel <b>2940</b><i>a</i>, but a much more stable and consistently reduced fluid velocity in bath <b>2940</b><i>d</i>. Whereas, outlet <b>2340</b> shows less consistency in the fluid velocity within the bath of the emitter. In particular, the fluid velocity of outlet <b>2340</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>24</b>A-F</figref> allows for a maximum fluid velocity of 3.7 ft/s. Whereas, the fluid velocity of the outlet <b>2940</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>30</b>A-H</figref> allows for a maximum fluid velocity of only 2.1 ft/s (i.e., a 43% reduction in fluid velocity). The outlet illustrated is designed to reduce maximum fluid velocity below 3 ft/s and in a preferred form, below 2.5 ft/s.</p>
<p id="p-0292" num="0289">By reducing the fluid velocity and keeping the velocity of the fluid in bath <b>2940</b><i>d </i>more consistent, the emitter outlet <b>2940</b> is capable of reducing the instances where squirting would be caused by the emitter even in situations where the outlet hole formed in the drip line tubing to which the emitter is connected is not positioned perfectly with respect to bath <b>2940</b><i>d</i>. This allows the drip line manufacturing to be done with a more forgiving tolerance with respect to outlet opening formation in the drip line, which allows for the production of drip line to be done at a faster pace while still yielding good results (e.g., good drip line). As mentioned above, this configuration also allows for the drip line opening to be formed in the drip line tubing over a greater area because of the uninterrupted expense the emitter outlet provides for the drip line opening to be made over. It also allows for larger emitter drip line openings to be made if desired.</p>
<p id="p-0293" num="0290">In addition to the emitter outlet, emitter and dripline embodiments disclosed herein, it should also be understood that a plurality of methods are also disclosed. For example, a method of reducing fluid velocity in an emitter is disclosed comprising providing an emitter outlet according to the above (<b>2940</b>) and causing a first fluid velocity reduction at the first fluid velocity reducing turn (transition from <b>2940</b><i>aa </i>to <b>2940</b><i>ab</i>), and causing a second fluid velocity reduction at the second fluid velocity reducing turn (e.g., <b>2940</b><i>b </i>or <b>2940</b><i>c</i>). In the form shown, the ingress channel <b>2940</b><i>a </i>includes first and second openings <b>2940</b><i>b</i>, <b>2940</b><i>c</i>, so the method includes causing a second fluid velocity reduction at the second fluid velocity reducing turn <b>2940</b><i>b </i>and causing a third fluid velocity reduction at the third fluid velocity reducing turn <b>2940</b><i>c</i>. Methods of manufacturing an emitter are also disclosed herein. It should also be understood that features of any of the above-mentioned emitters may be combined with features of the emitter <b>2910</b> to come-up with yet other new embodiments and all of these embodiments are intended to be covered by this disclosure</p>
<p id="p-0294" num="0291">In addition to disclosing herein outlets, emitters and drip line with such outlets, pressure compensating members and emitters, it should also be understood that various forms of drip line are also disclosed herein using any of the above mentioned pressure compensating members or emitters. In addition, it is contemplated that components or features of one embodiment can be combined with one or more embodiments to come up with entire new embodiments in accordance with this disclosure. For example, an irrigation drip line is contemplated herein having a tube having an inner surface and an outer surface with the inner surface defining an inner circumference of the tube, and a plurality of discrete emitters (any disclosed herein) connected to only a portion of the inner circumference of the inner surface of the tube and at regular intervals therein. For example, in some forms, the discrete emitters may take the shape of the emitters depicted in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>21</b>A-<b>28</b>H</figref>. In other forms, the emitters may use features from any of the above emitters to form new emitters placed at regular intervals within the drip line tube. In some instances, this will mean emitters with uniform elastomeric emitter bodies will be used in the dripline, while in other instances poly-material emitters may be used in the dripline.</p>
<p id="p-0295" num="0292">In addition to the above-mentioned emitter embodiments, there has been disclosed herein numerous different methods. For example, methods of making grit tolerant emitters are disclosed herein. In some forms, such methods include providing an emitter having an inlet, an outlet and a flow passage extending between the inlet and outlet and in fluid communication with same, the flow passage having a pressure compensating portion with tapered baffles capable of moving between a first position having a flow passage opening of a first cross-section and a second position having a flow passage opening of a second cross-section smaller than the first cross-section to compensate for increases in fluid pressure traveling within a fluid line that the emitter is connected to, the tapering baffles separating the pressure compensating portion of the emitter into an upstream portion and a downstream portion; and configuring the tapering baffles such that the upstream portion of the compensating portion is larger in area and volume than the downstream portion in order to ensure greater pressure will be applied to the upstream portion of the pressure compensating portion to assist in flushing grit from the pressure compensating portion of the emitter. That is, as grit blockage reaches a point where the desired flow rate is not being provided, pressure will build-up on the upstream side of the teeth in the PC chamber. This will cause the floor to move away from the inner surface of the tube, thereby opening up the span between the teeth and the inner surface of the tube to allow the grit to pass over and downstream of the teeth. The size of the upstream floor and volume of the upstream portion is determined based on being able to provide the appropriate amount of flushing pressure. Thus, this area and volume can be changed to accommodate design parameters where larger or smaller pressure thresholds are desired. Further, a step is preferably formed in each tooth in order to ensure that the teeth cannot stop all fluid flow so that fluid flow continues downstream and can further assist with the flushing of grit out of the emitter. The step in the teeth also helps the desired movement to occur in the PC portion of the emitter on a more consistent and repeatable basis from emitter to emitter. Other methods include methods of reducing pressure of fluid flowing through an emitter, methods of compensating for fluid line pressure fluctuations and methods for preventing grit buildup.</p>
<p id="p-0296" num="0293">Again, the different emitter designs or layouts may be formed by a single, one-piece emitter, however, in other forms, they may be formed by interchanging various emitter portions to obtain the emitter properties desired for a particular application. In addition to having these interchangeable portions or in lieu of having these interchangeable portions, it should be understood that the mold for producing the emitter could be configured with different inserts to produce emitters of different types (e.g., emitters of different flow rates, emitters of different pressure compensation characteristics (if any pressure compensating), emitters with different flow channel shapes or sizes, etc.).</p>
<p id="p-0297" num="0294">Thus, disclosed herein is also an open-face non-cylindrical irrigation drip emitter for attachment to only a circumferential portion of an inner surface of an irrigation drip line tube carrying pressurized fluid comprising an emitter body having an inlet portion, flow passage portion and outlet portion, wherein at least one of the inlet portion, flow passage portion or outlet portion is formed from a first insert disposed in the emitter body that can be interchanged with a second insert in order to provide an emitter with a different performance characteristic. In one form, the flow passage portion of the open-face non-cylindrical irrigation drip emitter includes both a pressure reduction portion and a pressure compensation portion and at least one of the inlet portion, pressure reduction portion, pressure compensation portion and outlet portion is formed by the first insert disposed in the emitter body that can be interchanged with the second insert in order to provide an emitter with a different performance characteristic. an emitter body having an inlet portion, flow passage portion and outlet portion, wherein at least one of the inlet portion, flow passage portion or outlet portion is formed as an interchangeable or swappable insert that can be changed or replaced with a second emitter insert portion in order to provide an emitter with a different design or performance characteristic. Thus, the first insert disposed in the emitter body comprises an interchangeable or swappable insert that can be interchanged or swapped with a second insert having a different design or performance characteristic to alter how the emitter performs. This configuration provides yet another way in which emitters with different performance characteristics may be made or formed (e.g., emitters with different flow rates, reaction rates to changes in fluid line pressure, etc.).</p>
<p id="p-0298" num="0295">In addition to the above embodiments, it should be understood that various methods of manufacturing or assembling irrigation drip lines, methods of compensating for pressure in a supply line (e.g., increases or decreases in supply line fluid pressure), methods of manufacturing an emitter and methods of reducing fluid flow pressure are also disclosed herein. For example, a method of assembling an irrigation drip line is disclosed which comprises providing a drip emitter according to any of the above mentioned embodiments where at least one of the inner and outer baffle walls include a tapered baffle wall section, extruding a drip line tube and inserting the provided drip emitter into the drip line tube as it is extruded such that upper surfaces of the emitter other than the tapered baffle wall section are bonded with an inner surface of the extruded drip line tube to form a sealed engagement so that a pressure reduction flow channel is formed between the inlet and outlet area of the emitter. In a preferred form, the upper surfaces of the non-tapered baffle walls are bonded to the inner surface of the extruded drip line tube to form this sealed engagement so that an elongated tortuous passage is formed between the inlet and outlet of the emitter.</p>
<p id="p-0299" num="0296">In addition to this method, there are disclosed several methods of compensating for pressure in irrigation drip emitters. For example, a method of compensating for pressure in an irrigation drip emitter is disclosed comprising providing a drip emitter according to any of the above-mentioned embodiments wherein the baffle walls have upper surfaces with a first radius of curvature and the inner baffle wall has a first portion of constant height and a second portion of tapering height that is variably moveable between a first low pressure position wherein the upper surface of the second portion is not generally level with the upper surface of the first portion and fluid can flow over the upper surface of the second portion at low fluid pressures and a second high pressure position wherein the upper surface of the second portion is level with the upper surface of the first portion such that fluid is prevented from flowing over the upper surface of the second portion and the cross-section of the flow channel is reduced and the extent of the flow channel is effectively lengthened, and moving the second portion of the inner baffle wall between the first low pressure position wherein the upper surface of the second portion is not level with the upper surface of the first portion and fluid can flow over the upper surface of the second portion at low fluid pressures and the second high pressure position wherein the upper surface of the second portion moves toward a position that is level with the upper surface of the first portion so that fluid is prevented or at least hindered from flowing over the upper surface of the second portion to reduce the cross-section of the flow channel and effectively lengthen the extent of the flow channel the fluid has to pass through at high fluid pressure in order to compensate for an increase in fluid supply pressure, and moving variably the second portion of the inner baffle wall toward and/or to the second high pressure position to compensate for an increase in fluid pressure and toward and/or to the first low pressure position to compensate for a decrease in fluid supply pressure.</p>
<p id="p-0300" num="0297">Alternatively, a method of compensating for pressure in an irrigation drip emitter is disclosed which comprises providing a drip emitter according to any of the above-mentioned embodiments wherein the baffle walls have upper surfaces with a first radius of curvature and the inner baffle wall terminates in a first structure and the outer baffle wall includes a second structure that generally corresponds in shape and/or meshes with the first structure and is positioned proximate the first structure, with the first and second structures tapering in height toward one another and being variably moveable between a first low pressure position wherein the upper surfaces of the tapered structures are not level with the upper surfaces of the baffle walls and fluid can flow over the tapered structures at low fluid pressure and a second high pressure position wherein the upper surfaces of the tapered structures are level with the upper surfaces of the baffle walls and fluid is prevented from flowing over the tapered structures to reduce the cross-section of the flow channel proximate the first and second structures and effectively lengthen the extent or amount of the flow channel the fluid has to pass through at high fluid pressure, and moving variably the first and second structures toward and/or to the second high pressure position to compensate for an increase in fluid supply pressure and toward and/or to the first low pressure position to compensate for a decrease in fluid supply pressure.</p>
<p id="p-0301" num="0298">Alternatively, another method of compensating for pressure in an irrigation drip emitter is disclosed comprising providing an irrigation drip emitter according to any of the embodiments disclosed herein, wherein the baffle walls have upper surfaces with a first radius of curvature and the inlet includes a plurality of inlet openings or passages extending from a surface of the body exposed to the pressurized supply fluid to the pressure reducing flow channel, each inlet passage extending through a boss with a terminal end extending progressively further into the pressure reducing flow channel, each of the terminal ends moveable variably between an open position wherein the upper surface of the terminal end of the boss is not at the same general level as the baffle walls (or with the upper surfaces of the terminal end and baffle walls not being at a common radius of curvature) so that fluid can continue to flow through the boss and into the flow channel and a closed position wherein the terminal end of the boss is generally level with the upper surfaces of the baffle walls and has a generally common radius of curvature as the first radius of curvature of the baffle walls so that fluid is prevented from flowing through the boss or inlet sleeve and into the flow channel, and moving variably the inlet openings or terminal ends of the bosses toward and/or to the second high pressure closed positions to compensate for an increase in fluid supply pressure and toward and/or to the first low pressure open positions to compensate for a decrease in fluid supply pressure.</p>
<p id="p-0302" num="0299">In the above examples, it should be clear that movement of the moveable walls or structures to compensate for fluid pressure increases and decreases can either be complete movements from a first limit of travel to a second limit of travel (i.e., from a furthest most open position to a furthest most closed position and vice versa), or alternatively, may simply be movements toward one or more of those limits of travel without those limits actually having been reached (i.e., movement toward a furthest most open position to a furthest most closed position and vice versa). In addition, the material chosen for the emitter body (e.g., 20, 120, 220 above), may be selected such that such movement happens at a desired pace. For example, if a quick opening and closing is desired, a material that is more flexible or has a lower Durometer value may be selected. Whereas, if a slower or more gradual opening and closing (or transitioning from one or the other) is desired, a material that is less flexible or that has a higher Durometer value may be selected.</p>
<p id="p-0303" num="0300">There also are disclosed herein various methods for processing grit through an emitter or clearing emitters and/or drip lines of obstructions. For example, one method for processing grit comprises providing an emitter of the type discussed above, adjusting the fluid pressure that the emitter is subjected to in a supply line to alter the size or shape of the flow channel to expel any obstructions clogging the emitter (e.g., obstructions clogging an inlet, flow channel, outlet, etc.). In one form, this is done by decreasing the fluid pressure to maximize the cross-sectional area of the flow channel and/or create a central flow channel through which any obstructions such as grit or other particulates may be flushed. In another form, this is done by increasing the fluid pressure to cause the baffle walls of the flow channel to deflect, bend or tip so that obstructions can pass through the flow channel or be carried out of the emitter via the high pressure fluid passing therethrough.</p>
<p id="p-0304" num="0301">Other methods disclosed herein include methods for manufacturing an emitter comprising providing an emitter body made-up of a single material or unitary body construction defining an emitter inlet, at least part of the tortuous flow passage and an outlet bath and inserting a root inhibiting member in or proximate to the outlet bath of the emitter to inhibit roots from obstructing the emitter or operation thereof once the unitary body member is connected to tubing to form the finished emitter. In another form, a method of manufacturing an emitter comprises providing an emitter body made-up of a single material or unitary body construction defining the emitter inlet, at least part of the tortuous flow passage and an outlet bath and elongating the inlet opening to draw fluid from closer to the center of the inner lumen of the tube in an effort to draw fluid with less grit to inhibit grit from obstructing the emitter or operation thereof once the unitary body member is connected to tubing to form the finished emitter product. Another method disclosed relates to the manufacturing of an emitter comprising providing a unitary emitter body defining an emitter inlet, at least a portion of the tortuous flow passage and an outlet bath and both inserting a root inhibiting member in or proximate to the outlet bath and elongating the inlet opening to draw fluid from closer to the middle or center region of the inner lumen. Yet another method disclosed relates to a method of controlling a pressure compensation portion of an emitter by defining a trampoline area that allows the pressure compensation portion to move as desired. For example, such a method may include increasing the size of the trampoline area of the pressure compensation member on one side of the emitter to an area larger than the overall size of the pressure compensation member area located on the opposite side of the emitter (e.g., the area containing the moveable teeth or flippers) to make the emitter more responsive to fluid pressure increases and decreases. Conversely, the size of the trampoline area may be reduced in order to make the emitter less responsive to fluid pressure increases and decreases.</p>
<p id="p-0305" num="0302">Another method comprises a method of manufacturing and/or inserting an emitter into tubing which includes providing an emitter body having an inlet, outlet and tortuous flow passage connecting the inlet and outlet in fluid communication with one another, providing a carrier in which the emitter body is disposed or to which the emitter body is connected, and connecting the emitter body to the carrier so that the emitter body can more easily be transported through an insertion tool and into drip tubing. In a preferred form, the connection between emitter body and carrier is permanent such that the carrier remains with the emitter body after the emitter is installed into tubing. However, in alternate forms, the method may further include separating the carrier from the emitter body once the emitter body is installed into the tubing.</p>
<p id="p-0306" num="0303">In addition, a method for reducing problems associated with cross-linking and bonding between an emitter and tubing have also been disclosed herein. For example, such a method may include providing an emitter body having an inlet, outlet and fluid passage connected between the inlet and outlet, and connecting a bracket to the emitter body made of a material that easily bonds with tubing as the tubing is being extruded to ensure a good connection between the emitter body and tubing that is free of cross-linking or bonding defects.</p>
<p id="p-0307" num="0304">It should also be understood that methods of improving and/or controlling emitter pressure compensation are also disclosed herein. For example, methods of improving and/or controlling emitter pressure compensation by forming a step in at least one moveable baffle tooth or flipper of the pressure compensator of the emitter have been disclosed (or forming a step in one or more baffle teeth/flippers for this purpose). Similar such methods have been disclosed that include forming a plurality of steps in a plurality of moveable baffles to help improve and/or control emitter pressure compensation. Methods of securing a root growth inhibitor to an emitter and methods for preventing and/or hindering grit build-up in an emitter and, specifically, an emitter outlet also have been disclosed.</p>
<p id="p-0308" num="0305">In view of the above, it should be appreciated that a method of manufacturing an open face flat in-line emitter has been disclosed herein including one or more of the following additional features: a root growth inhibitor member, an inlet projection and/or a carrier for assisting with installation of the emitter into tubing and/or bonding of the emitter to tubing. In addition, methods of manufacturing or assembling non-pressure compensating components are disclosed as are methods of manufacturing or assembling pressure compensating and/or non-pressure compensating emitters with interchangeable parts. Similarly, methods of manufacturing or assembling customizable emitters and methods of customizing or configuring emitters are also disclosed herein. In addition to providing methods of customizing or configuring emitters with interchangeable inserts, there are also methods of customizing or configuring emitters using a mold. The different emitter designs or layouts may be formed by interchanging various emitter portions to obtain the emitter properties desired for a particular application. In addition to having these interchangeable portions, it should be understood that the mold for manufacturing or producing the emitter could alternatively be configured with different inserts to produce emitters of different types (e.g., emitters with different designs or layouts, emitters with different flow rates, emitters with different pressure compensation characteristics (if any pressure compensating), emitters with different flow channel shapes or sizes, etc.).</p>
<p id="p-0309" num="0306">In some exemplary forms, the method for manufacturing an open-face non-cylindrical irrigation drip emitter for attachment to only a circumferential portion of an inner surface of an irrigation drip line tube carrying pressurized fluid comprises providing an emitter body having an inlet portion, flow passage portion and outlet portion, wherein at least one of the inlet portion, flow passage portion or outlet portion is formed as an interchangeable or swappable insert, and interchanging or swapping the interchangeable or swappable insert with a second emitter insert in order to alter the design or performance of the emitter. In other exemplary forms, the method of manufacturing an open-face non-cylindrical irrigation drip emitter for attachment to only a circumferential portion of an inner surface of an irrigation drip line tube carrying pressurized fluid comprises providing a mold for forming an emitter body having an inlet portion, flow passage portion and outlet portion, wherein the mold includes at least one interchangeable or swappable insert for forming at least one of the inlet portion, flow passage portion and outlet portion, and interchanging or swapping the interchangeable or swappable insert with a second emitter insert in order to alter the design or performance characteristic of the emitter manufactured by the mold. In still other exemplary forms, the method for improving the pressure compensating performance of a non-cylindrical irrigation drip emitter for attachment to only a circumferential portion of an inner surface of an irrigation drip line tube carrying pressurized fluid comprises providing an emitter body defining an inlet area, outlet area and a flow channel therebetween connecting the inlet and outlet areas, the flow channel defining a pressure reduction portion and a pressure compensating portion having a first volume at lower fluid pressure and a second volume smaller than the first volume at higher fluid pressure to restrict flow through the channel, wherein the pressure compensating portion includes at least one baffle tooth having a base, a tip and an upper surface extending between the base and tip, and forming at least one step in the base of the at least one baffle tooth so the base of the tooth is positioned at a height different from a proximate upper bonding surface of the emitter in order to improve pressure compensating performance of the emitter.</p>
<p id="p-0310" num="0307">Another method disclosed herein is a method of manufacturing an irrigation drip emitter for attachment to only a portion of an inner circumference of an inner surface of an irrigation drip line tube like that depicted in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>27</b>A-J</figref>. For example, a method of manufacturing an emitter comprising providing an elastomeric material, and molding the elastomeric material into a discrete elastomeric emitter body integrally defining: an inlet for receiving pressurized fluid from the tube; an outlet bath for discharging the fluid from the body; a pressure reducing flow channel extending from the inlet for reducing a pressure and flow of fluid received at the inlet, and a pressure compensating chamber positioned between the pressure reducing flow channel and the outlet bath to receive fluid from the pressure reducing flow channel, the chamber being defined by a moveable floor and at least one tapered baffle that separates the pressure compensating chamber into an upstream portion and a downstream portion formed by an inner flow passage defined by the at least one tapered baffle through which the fluid travels from the upstream portion. Similarly, a method of manufacturing a drip line having emitters similar to those illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>27</b>A-J</figref> is also contemplated. More particularly, a method of manufacturing an irrigation drip line tube including: providing an elastomeric material; molding the elastomeric material into a plurality of discrete elastomeric emitter bodies, each emitter body integrally defining an inlet for receiving pressurized fluid from the tube, an outlet bath for discharging the fluid from the body, a pressure reducing flow channel extending from the inlet for reducing a pressure and flow of fluid received at the inlet, and a pressure compensating chamber positioned between the pressure reducing flow channel and the outlet bath to receive fluid from the pressure reducing flow channel, the chamber being defined by a moveable floor and at least one tapered baffle that separates the pressure compensating chamber into an upstream portion and a downstream portion formed by an inner flow passage defined by the at least one tapered baffle through which the fluid travels from the upstream portion; extruding a drip line tube having an inner surface and an outer surface with the inner surface defining an inner circumference of the tube; and connecting the plurality of discrete elastomeric emitter bodies to only a portion of the inner circumference of the inner surface of the tube and at regular intervals therein.</p>
<p id="p-0311" num="0308">Other methods contemplated herein relate to the emitters of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>28</b>A-J</figref> and <b>29</b>A-H and include methods for manufacturing a pressure compensating member solely, as well as methods for manufacturing poly-material emitters having pressure compensating members. For example, in one instance a method of manufacturing a pressure compensating member for a poly-material emitter comprising providing an elastomeric material, and molding the elastomeric material into an elastomeric pressure compensating member integrally defining: a flexible floor; side walls extending substantially about a perimeter of the flexible floor and including an ingress opening and an egress opening; and at least one tapering baffle that separates the flexible floor and pressure compensating member into an upstream portion and a downstream portion with both the upstream portion and downstream portion having respective volumes or cross-sectional areas and the volume or cross-sectional area of the upstream portion being larger than the volume or cross-sectional area of the downstream portion to assist the pressure compensating member in flushing grit therethrough. The method may further entail molding a rigid emitter body such that the elastomeric pressure compensating member is disposed within an opening defined by the rigid emitter body. In some forms, this method comprises molding the rigid emitter body to define a seat upon which the pressure compensating member is rested.</p>
<p id="p-0312" num="0309">In other forms, methods of manufacturing poly-material emitters are disclosed comprising providing a polyethylene and an elastomeric material, molding the polyethylene into a rigid emitter body integrally defining an inlet, an outlet and a pressure reducing flow passage extending from the inlet, the rigid emitter body further defining a seat for a pressure compensating member, molding the elastomeric material into a pressure compensating member integrally defining: a flexible floor; side walls extending substantially about a perimeter of the flexible floor and including an ingress opening and an egress opening; and at least one tapering baffle that separates the flexible floor and pressure compensating member into an upstream portion and a downstream portion with both the upstream portion and downstream portion having respective volumes or cross-sectional areas and the volume or cross-sectional area of the upstream portion being larger than the volume or cross-sectional area of the downstream portion to assist the pressure compensating member in flushing grit therethrough or through the emitter.
