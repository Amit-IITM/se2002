<heading id="h-0001" level="1">TECHNICAL FIELD</heading>
<p id="p-0002" num="0001">The present disclosure relates to the field of low-temperature baked smoking sets, and particularly, to a low-temperature baked vaporizer and a low-temperature baked smoking set having same.</p>
<heading id="h-0002" level="1">BACKGROUND ART</heading>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">The low-temperature baked smoking sets mainly use some solid vaporizable materials such as tobacco shreds or opium paste etc. to be baked at a low-temperature to generate smoking smog for inhaling. For this low-temperature baked smoking sets, their structure always has a hollow cylindrical vaporizer. In use, the solid vaporizable materials are disposed inside the cylindrical vaporizer, by the vaporizer, the solid vaporizable materials are heated to generate smoking smog.</p>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">In practice, to match up with the cylindrical shape of the solid vaporizable materials, the vaporizer is shaped like a cylinder. To let the vaporizer work well, normally electrode pins are welded on two ends of the vaporizer. In the process that the vaporizer is in use, the main shortage is uneven heating of the cylindrical vaporizer, which contributes to unevenly generated smoking smog. More specifically, the unfolded the cylindrical vaporizer shows the heating area and the heating element <b>1</b> in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>. Two longitudinal ends of the heating element <b>1</b> both have an electrode pin <b>2</b> for connecting the power supply. After giving the electricity, even though the heating element <b>1</b> as a whole is manufactured by the conductive materials, the current itself prefers the shortest itinerary with minimum resistance to form a current loop. For example, the two current loops A and B are shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>, the current loop A has a shorter itinerary than the current loop B between the two electrode pins <b>2</b>, then most current prefers the current loop A to form the current loop, so most heat generated by the heating element <b>1</b> is centralized on the main heating area <b>3</b> in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>, whereas, the remaining area has less heat, so the heating element <b>1</b> as a whole generates heat unevenly.</p>

<p id="p-0059" num="0058">In this embodiment, the vaporizer <b>10</b><i>a </i>includes the sleeve <b>11</b><i>a, </i>the heating element <b>12</b><i>a </i>and power supply module <b>13</b><i>a. </i>By relying on electrical connection between the power supply module <b>13</b><i>a </i>and the heating element <b>12</b><i>a, </i>the heating element <b>12</b><i>a </i>is sleeved outside the sleeve <b>11</b><i>a. </i>The heating element <b>12</b><i>a </i>has a plurality sets of through holes <b>120</b><i>a, </i>for adjusting the resistance of the heating element <b>12</b><i>a </i>that can evenly heat the whole sleeve <b>11</b><i>a. </i>The sleeve <b>11</b><i>a </i>and the heating element <b>12</b><i>a </i>made by metallic materials, which can improve the heating temperature, make the heating element <b>12</b><i>a </i>produce smoking smog faster and eventually improve the user experience.</p>
<p id="p-0060" num="0059">In these embodiments, the solid vaporizable materials <b>20</b><i>a </i>may be at least one or more selected from a group of tobacco slices and tobacco sauces, or a group of tobacco rods, tobacco paste or herbs etc.</p>
<p id="p-0061" num="0060">In these embodiments, the housing <b>30</b><i>a </i>is nearly a hollow cylinder, configured for receiving the vaporizer <b>10</b><i>a. </i>The housing <b>30</b><i>a </i>may be a plastic shell such as polycarbonate, polyurethane, polyimide and some plastic materials with good heat preservation effect.

<p id="p-0062" num="0061">In these embodiments, the low-temperature baked smoking set <b>100</b><i>a </i>includes a vaporizer <b>10</b><i>a </i>for improving the heating temperature, making the low-temperature baked smoking set <b>100</b><i>a </i>available for producing smoking smog faster, therefore the user experience is effectively improved.</p>
<p id="p-0063" num="0062">Beyond the above embodiments, the present disclosure relates to another vaporizer in accordance with another embodiment, as shown from <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>6</b></figref> to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>8</b></figref>. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>6</b></figref> illustrates the assembled vaporizer in the low-temperature baked smoking set. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>7</b></figref> illustrates the sleeve of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>6</b></figref>. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>8</b></figref> illustrates the heating element of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>6</b></figref>. The vaporizer include a hollow sleeve <b>10</b>, a heating element <b>20</b> surrounded around the hollow sleeve <b>10</b> and an electrode connector <b>30</b> carried on the heating element <b>20</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0064" num="0063">The sleeve <b>10</b> is made from thermal conductive materials, configured for receiving the solid vaporizable materials inside;</p>
<p id="p-0065" num="0064">The shape of the heating element <b>20</b> is matched with the cylindrical-shaped of the sleeve <b>10</b>, since the heating element <b>20</b> is sleeved outside the sleeve <b>10</b>, configured for heating the vaporizable materials.</p>
<p id="p-0066" num="0065">The electrode connector <b>30</b> is defined as an electrode pin as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>6</b></figref> to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>8</b></figref>, and configured for connecting with an output electrode of the power supply module, supplying power to the heating element <b>20</b> for generating heat. It makes sense that the electrode pins are the most common electrode connecting components in the prior arts; except for the electrode pins in the present disclosure, the electrode connectors <b>30</b> further may be electrode poles or terminals etc.</p>
<p id="p-0067" num="0066">Furthermore, in accordance with the above embodiments, the heating element <b>20</b> is made from electric materials in favor of heating the vaporizable materials, such as pure nickel alloys, nickel-chrome alloys, nickel-iron alloys, iron-chromium alloys, iron-chromium-aluminum alloys, titanium alloys and stainless steels etc. But the sleeve <b>10</b> is made from better thermal-conductive materials, like metallic materials, such as pure metals, alloys, metallic compounds or specialty materials etc., of which the alloys are composed of at least one of irons, coppers, aluminums, tins, gold, silver etc. Since the sleeve <b>10</b> adopts the metallic materials, electrical-conduction between the heating element <b>20</b> and the sleeve <b>10</b> is avoided, by an insulating layer <b>40</b> disposed between the sleeve <b>10</b> and outside surface of the heating element <b>20</b>. The insulating layer <b>40</b> is made by methods of sputtering, deposition, coating, or attaching films to the surface of the sleeve <b>10</b>. For a purpose of insulation, the insulating layer <b>40</b> itself is made from at least one selected from a group of synthetic resins, polyimide resins, polyurethane resins and metallic oxides etc. The sleeve <b>10</b> is configured for receiving the vaporizable materials, inner diameter of the sleeve <b>10</b> has to be matched up with the diameter of the vaporizable materials, 5-8 mm are chosen in the present invention, which ensures smooth insertion of the vaporizable materials and ensures the vaporizable materials to tightly abuts against the sleeve <b>10</b>, eventually improving the heating efficiency.</p>
<p id="p-0068" num="0067">Furthermore, the cylindrical-shaped heating element <b>20</b> is formed by wrapping a layer-shaped object around the sleeve <b>10</b> along its width direction. To more clearly see the shape of the heating element <b>20</b> itself and structure, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>8</b></figref> illustrates a heating element <b>20</b> in use according to embodiments of the present disclosure. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>14</b></figref> also illustrates the heating element unfolded circumferentially of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>8</b></figref>. The heating element <b>20</b> itself as a layer-shaped structure is wrapped around the outside surface of the sleeve <b>10</b> which forms a cylinder to match up with the sleeve <b>10</b>. The layer-shaped heating element <b>20</b> has an even thickness from a range of 0.03&#x2dc;0.1 mm.</p>
<p id="p-0069" num="0068">Further referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>8</b></figref> to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>14</b></figref>, two longitudinal ends of the heating element <b>20</b> include the electrode connecting parts <b>21</b>, the above electrode connectors <b>30</b> are electrically connected with the electrode connecting parts <b>21</b>. Of course, the number of the electrode connecting parts <b>21</b> is at least two. For example, the first electrode connecting part <b>211</b> and the second electrode connecting part <b>212</b> are respectively connected with a positive electrode and a negative electrode of the power supply to from current loops. The material of the electrode connecting parts <b>21</b> is the same as the electrode connector <b>30</b>. In embodiments of the present disclosure, the electrode connectors <b>30</b> are electrode pins, then the corresponding electrode connecting parts <b>21</b> are pin welding points. In some embodiments, the electrode connectors <b>30</b> are plug terminals, the electrode connecting parts <b>21</b> are plug points available for the plug terminals. Under the circumstance, based on the shape of the heating element <b>20</b>, it is best to adopt the way of pin welding. Of course, in other feasible situations, multiple other welding methods may be adopted.</p>
<p id="p-0070" num="0069">Furthermore, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>6</b></figref>, and from <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>9</b></figref> to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>13</b></figref>, the above heating element <b>20</b> has a first side edge <b>23</b> and a second side edge <b>24</b> along a breadth direction thereof. The above first electrode connecting part <b>211</b> and second electrode connecting part <b>212</b> both are disposed at a certain position, like, a central position between the first side edge <b>23</b> and the second side edge <b>24</b>. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>6</b></figref>, when the heating element <b>20</b> is wrapped around the sleeve <b>10</b>, the first side edge <b>23</b> and the second side edge <b>24</b> are closing but contactless with each other, remaining about 1&#x2dc;5 mm distance therebetween, which may basically cover the circumferential surface of the sleeve <b>10</b>, but also avoid overheating due to the contact of the first side edge <b>23</b> and the second side edge <b>24</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0071" num="0070">Furthermore, to make the current evenly passing through the heating element <b>20</b>, and ensure every area of the heating element <b>20</b> with a suitable resistance, the heating element <b>20</b> is bored with some through holes. For example, according to the power for heating in normal use, the whole resistance of the heating element <b>20</b> maintains at 04&#x2dc;1.0 ohms. As shown from <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>9</b></figref> to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>13</b></figref>, the heating element <b>20</b> is opened with a plurality sets of through holes <b>22</b> along a breadth direction or a circumferential direction of the heating element <b>20</b>. The plurality sets of through holes <b>22</b> are provided to increase resistance of an area of the heating element <b>20</b> near to the electrode connecting part <b>21</b> and also increase resistance of an area of the heating element <b>20</b> far away from the electrode connecting part <b>21</b>, as an aid to equal the resistances of the area near to the electrode connecting part <b>21</b> and the area far away from the electrode connecting part <b>21</b>, so the whole heating element <b>20</b> circumferentially generates heat evenly. For achieve an even resistance, the plurality sets of through holes <b>22</b> are arrayed unevenly, the array of sets of through holes is shown from <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>9</b></figref> to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>13</b></figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0072" num="0071">In terms of the heating element <b>20</b> in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>9</b></figref>, two longitudinal ends of the heating element <b>20</b> are the electrode connecting parts <b>21</b>, i.e. the first electrode connecting part <b>211</b> and the second electrode connecting part <b>212</b>, which are respectively connected with the positive and negative terminals of the power supply via the electrode connectors <b>30</b>. Each set of through holes <b>22</b> arrayed on the heating element <b>20</b> has at least one through hole <b>221</b> along a length direction, that is, an axial direction after the heating element <b>20</b> is wrapped. Along a breadth direction, adjacent sets of through holes <b>22</b> are staggered with each other, for example, the adjacent set of through holes <b>22</b>A and the adjacent set of through holes <b>22</b>B are arrayed in the staggered manner, not in the aligned manner, therefore, the current path and resistance would be more diffusive, to let the heating element <b>20</b> generate heat more evenly. For example, in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>9</b></figref>, two currents a and b are dispersed at two different areas, but the current density, current value and resistance of currents a and b come to the same, therefore, the heat generated by the heating element <b>20</b> is basically the same in different areas.</p>
<p id="p-0073" num="0072">According to the embodiment shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>9</b></figref>, the through holes <b>221</b> belonging to one same set of through holes <b>22</b> may be same in the shape, the size and the distance. Of course, the through holes <b>221</b> belonging to the same set of through holes <b>22</b> may be different in the shape, the size and the distance.</p>
<p id="p-0074" num="0073">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>10</b></figref>, which illustrates the heating element unfolded along a circumferential direction thereof in accordance with another embodiment of the present disclosure. In this embodiment, each set of through holes <b>22</b> has at least one through holes <b>221</b> along a length direction of the heating element <b>20</b>. When these sets of through holes <b>22</b> are arrayed along a breadth direction of the heating element <b>20</b>, the distance between adjacent sets of through holes <b>22</b> gets larger along a direction deviating from the electrode connecting part <b>21</b>, basically, to make smaller size of through holes closing to the first side edge <b>23</b> or the second side edge <b>24</b> compared with through holes closing to the electrode connecting part <b>211</b>. In this case, the resistances of different areas in the heating element <b>20</b> have been changed again, and the distance between adjacent sets of through holes <b>22</b> gets larger along a direction deviating from the electrode connecting part <b>21</b>, so the resistance of an area closing to the electrode connecting part <b>21</b> is increasing, and the resistance increase rate of the area near to the electrode connecting part <b>21</b> is larger than the resistance increase rate of the area far away from the electrode connecting part <b>21</b>, as an aid to adjust the resistance of the whole heating element <b>20</b> with consequently even current, so the whole heating element <b>20</b> circumferentially generates heat evenly. For example, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>10</b></figref> shows two current paths m and n, even through the current path m has longer itinerary then the current path n from the electrode connecting part <b>211</b> to the electrode connecting part <b>212</b>, since the adjusted resistances of the current path m and the current path n come to be same, finally, the current paths m and n have equal current value, therefore generating even heat.</p>
<p id="p-0075" num="0074">Meanwhile, other embodiments of the present disclosure relate to another method to achieve even resistance of the whole heating element <b>20</b> by designing sets of through holes <b>22</b> arrayed along a breadth direction. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>11</b></figref>, the adjacent sets of through holes <b>22</b> have the same distance along a breadth direction, but with deviating from the electrode connecting part <b>21</b> the size of each through hole <b>221</b> in each set of through holes <b>22</b> is decreasing, under the circumstance, the resistance of the area closing to the electrode connecting part <b>21</b>is increasing, the resistance increasing rate of the area near to the electrode connecting part <b>21</b> is larger than a resistance increasing rate of the area far away from the electrode connecting part <b>21</b>, as an aid to even the resistance of the whole heating element <b>20</b>, consequently, the heating element <b>20</b> generates even heat. Likewise, the through holes <b>221</b> in one set of through holes <b>22</b> have same size and are arrayed in same distance between adjacent through holes <b>221</b> along the length direction thereof, which contributes to even the resistance of the heating element <b>20</b> along the length direction thereof.</p>
<p id="p-0076" num="0075">Understandable, the above two arraying method in the aforementioned embodiments in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>10</b></figref> and <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>11</b></figref> may be combined in use, the sets of through holes <b>22</b> may be arrayed with that the sizes are gradually deceasing and the distances are gradually increasing simultaneously along a breadth direction of the heating element <b>20</b>, as another aid to even the resistance of the whole heating element <b>20</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0077" num="0076">Understandable, the embodiments as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>10</b></figref> and <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>11</b></figref>, the through holes <b>221</b> in the sets of through holes <b>22</b> have variable sizes and distances along a direction deviating from the electrode connecting part <b>21</b>. Since the electrode connecting parts <b>21</b> are respectively disposed at middle of two longitudinal ends of the heating element <b>20</b>, to make the main current paths as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>10</b></figref> and <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>11</b></figref> distributive around the shortest itinerary from the upper and lower electrode connecting parts <b>21</b>. Therefore, by relying on the electrode connecting parts <b>21</b> as a start of the variable through holes <b>221</b> to change the sizes and distances of the through holes <b>221</b>, these variable through holes <b>221</b> may make the resistances of different areas of the heating element <b>20</b> even. When the electrode connecting parts <b>21</b> are not at middle as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>10</b></figref> and <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>11</b></figref>, the through holes <b>221</b> in the sets of through holes <b>22</b> with variable sizes, distances and the start of the variable through holes <b>221</b> have to be in accordance with the position of the electrode connecting parts <b>21</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0078" num="0077">Further, referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>12</b></figref> and <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>13</b></figref>, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>12</b></figref> illustrates the heating element unfolded along a circumferential direction thereof in accordance with another embodiment of the present disclosure. Under the circumstance, through holes <b>221</b> in each set of through holes <b>22</b> are arrayed with decreasing sizes along the length direction. However, in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>13</b></figref>, which illustrates the heating element unfolded along a circumferential direction thereof in accordance with another embodiment of the present disclosure. All through holes <b>221</b> in each set of through holes <b>22</b> are arrayed with increasing distances along the length direction.</p>
<p id="p-0079" num="0078">With the aforementioned two kinds of arrays of through holes <b>221</b> in sets of through holes <b>22</b>in changing sizes and distances, because of the current paths dividing and combining manifolds along the length direction, the resistance of the whole heating element <b>20</b> has changed, that means the heating area on the original heating element <b>20</b> has been decentralized and restrained, so as to even the resistance of the heating areas on the heating element <b>20</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0080" num="0079">In some embodiments, the through holes <b>221</b> in sets of through holes <b>22</b> may have variety of shapes, such as round, rectangular or hexagon and so on.</p>
<p id="p-0081" num="0080">During the low-temperature smoking set is inhaled, since at beginning the vaporizable materials, like a brand new tobacco cigarette has a plenty of tobacco, a big amount of smoking smog may be generated, but with the increasing time for baking the tobacco cigarette, the amount of smoking smog will be decreased. So after the tobacco cigarette is baked for a while, to improve the amount of smoking smog and even the amount of smoking smog in a whole process of inhaling, a heating element <b>20</b> as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>14</b></figref> is adapted. In the embodiment, the heating element <b>20</b> has two heating area in serial connection along a length direction thereof, that is, a first heating area <b>210</b> and a second heating area <b>220</b>, which are both disposed between the first side edge <b>23</b> and the second side edge <b>24</b>. The first and second heating areas <b>210</b>, <b>220</b> are in serial connection via a connector <b>230</b>. The first and second heating areas <b>210</b>, <b>220</b> are both opened with sets of through holes <b>22</b>, nonetheless, the connector <b>230</b> is a region with no through holes. By relying on the first heating area <b>210</b> and a second heating area <b>220</b> in serial connection, they may adjust the length of the tobacco cigarette to improve the amount of smoking smog. More specifically, the longitudinal end of the first heating area <b>210</b> has a first connecting part <b>211</b>, an opposite end of the second heating area <b>220</b> has a second connecting part <b>213</b>. And the connector <b>230</b> in serial connection with the first heating area <b>210</b> and the second heating area <b>220</b> has a connecting part <b>212</b> shared by the first heating area <b>210</b> and the second heating area <b>220</b>. The first heating area <b>210</b> and the second heating area <b>220</b> are respectively electrically connected with the power supply via the first connecting part <b>211</b>, the second connecting part <b>213</b> and the shared connecting part <b>212</b>. During an initial heating process, the amount of the smoking smog when baking the tobacco cigarette is quite large, it is available to let the first electrode connecting part <b>212</b> and the shared connecting part <b>212</b> be electrically connected with the positive and negative ends of the power supply via the electrode connectors <b>30</b>, that are the electrode pins, so that the first heating area <b>210</b> works to heat the tobacco cigarette. As the heating time extends, the amount of the smoking smog is gradually reducing, so it needs to change electrode connecting methods: electrically connecting the first electrode connecting part <b>212</b> and the second electrode connecting part <b>213</b> respectively with positive and negative terminals of the power supply, therefore, the first heating area <b>210</b> and the second heating area <b>220</b> are both at the heating status then the heating zone and the amount of the smoking smog will be improved. Under the circumstances, the above segmented heating method is used to heat multiple heating areas of the heating element <b>20</b>, and the control method for controlling the heating process in different statuses, the smoking smog come to be even during different statuses of heating the tobacco cigarette.</p>
<p id="p-0082" num="0081">Of course, in the above embodiments of segmented heating, the first heating area <b>210</b> works first, then the first heating area <b>210</b> and the second heating area <b>220</b> work simultaneously. In another embodiment, the second electrode connecting part <b>213</b> and the shared electrode connecting part <b>212</b> are firstly connected with positive and negative terminals of the power supply to let the second heating area <b>220</b> work firstly, until the smoking smog reduces then replaced by that the first electrode connecting part <b>211</b>and the second electrode connecting part <b>213</b> are respectively connected with positive and negative terminals of the power supply, in this case, the first heating area <b>210</b> and the second heating area <b>220</b> both works to improve the smoking smog.</p>
<p id="p-0083" num="0082">In the above embodiment as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>14</b></figref>, the number of the heating areas are two, however, in some embodiments, the number is there, four or more, with correspondingly more electrode connecting parts needed. The segmented heating method may let partial heating area of the heating element work firstly, after a while, much more heating areas thereof work. The specific number of heating areas may be determined by the length of the tobacco cigarette and each heating area. When being controlled, the electrode connecting parts corresponding to the heating areas may be electrically connected.</p>
<p id="p-0084" num="0083">Based on the above embodiment in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>14</b></figref>, the heating element <b>20</b> includes multiple heating areas, such as the first heating area <b>210</b> and the second heating area <b>220</b>. Also, another embodiment of the present disclosure relates to another method to design the heating element <b>20</b>, each heating area has multiple heating zones. The first heating area <b>210</b> includes three heating zones, that is a first heating zone <b>2110</b>, a second heating zone <b>2120</b> and a third heating zone <b>2130</b>. Each heating zone has several through holes in array-arrangement. The through holes in different heating zones have different shapes and/or sizes, compared with other through holes in other heating zones, like the three heating zones in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>15</b></figref>, through holes with different sizes and shapes are arranged along the length direction, such as comparatively large holes, small holes and square-shaped holes, to further make the resistance of each heating zone come to be the same, so as to improve evenness of heating. Likewise, the second heating area <b>220</b> is similar with the first heating area <b>210</b>, which includes three different through holes with different sizes and shapes. In some embodiments, the number of the heating zones is four or more except from three heating zones in the embodiment, each heating zone has different dimensioned and/or shaped through holes, such as hexagonal or diamond-shaped through holes.</p>
<p id="p-0085" num="0084">From the aforementioned embodiments, the first heating area <b>210</b> includes three heating zones along the length or longitudinal direction of the heating element <b>20</b>. In some embodiments, the heating zones are arranged along the breadth direction or horizontal direction of the heating element <b>20</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0086" num="0085">Based on the sectional heating method, similar to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>14</b></figref>, it makes sense that the longitudinal end of the first heating area <b>210</b>, the opposite end of the first heating area <b>210</b> and the second heating area <b>220</b>, the serial connected area between the first heating area <b>210</b> and the second heating area <b>220</b> of the heating element <b>20</b> have the electrode connecting parts respectively, for connecting with the positive and negative terminals of the power supply, therefore sectional heating of the tobacco cigarette is realized to make the smoking smog even.</p>
<p id="p-0087" num="0086">Likewise, based on the above sectional heating method on the heating element <b>20</b>, another design of the heating element <b>20</b> is shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>16</b></figref> and <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>17</b></figref>, and referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>16</b></figref>, the heating element <b>20</b> also includes two heating areas <b>210</b> along a length direction. Each heating area <b>210</b> has sets of through holes <b>22</b> along a breadth direction of the heating element <b>20</b>, each set of through holes <b>22</b> includes several through holes <b>221</b> along the length direction. Meanwhile, through holes <b>22</b> in each set of through holes are dimensioned with gradually increasing sizes. The longitudinal end, the opposite end, and between two heating areas <b>210</b> respectively have the electrode connecting parts <b>21</b> for electrically connecting the power supply. The sectional heating method may be the same as the above embodiment, firstly one heating area <b>210</b> works to generate heat by electrically connecting corresponding electrode connecting parts <b>21</b>, after a while, the whole heating element <b>20</b> works to generate heat by electrically connecting the longitudinal end and opposite end of the whole heating element <b>20</b>, the controlling method realizes the sectional heating.</p>
<p id="p-0088" num="0087">According to the embodiment in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>17</b></figref>, the controlling method for controlling the heating element <b>20</b> to work is similar to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>16</b></figref>, two heating areas are configured for sectional heating, that is the first heating area <b>210</b> and the second heating area <b>220</b>; the differential is that the through holes <b>221</b> in each set of through holes <b>22</b> are dimensioned with gradually decreasing sizes. In terms of segmental heating, the first heating area <b>210</b> has same sets of through holes <b>22</b> with the second heating area <b>220</b> in same size and same array, such that the first heating area <b>210</b> has a same resistance with the second heating area <b>220</b>. Or the first heating area <b>210</b> has different sets of through holes <b>22</b> with the second heating area <b>220</b> in different size and different array, just to guarantee that the first heating area <b>210</b> has a same resistance with the second heating area <b>220</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0089" num="0088">In view of the above, the heating element <b>20</b> may work as a whole to heat simultaneously, or as the sectional heating in accordance with the aforementioned embodiments. At least two heating areas are arrayed along the axial direction. And each heating area owes corresponding electrode connecting parts for electrically connecting with the power supply, controlled independently. Part of the heating areas is chosen to work when demanded, to realize the effect of sectional heating the tobacco cigarette.</p>
<p id="p-0090" num="0089">With the above arrays of sets of through holes in changing sizes, changing distances or staggered with each other, the resistance of whole heating element has changed, and comes to even. Meanwhile, referring to the three heating zones in the embodiment of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>15</b></figref>, one heating area is divided into at least two heating zones, different heating zone has different sets of through holes in different shapes and sizes, the resistance of whole heating element has changed too, therefore realizing even heating of the heating element <b>20</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0091" num="0090">In the above embodiments, by changing the sets of through holes in the heating element <b>20</b>, the resistance of the heating element has reduced longitudinally, to assemble and contact with the tobacco cigarette. More specifically, for low-temperature baked smoking set, the tobacco cigarette has to be inserted into the sleeve of the vaporizer, then inhaled. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>18</b></figref> illustrates the low-temperature baked smoking set assembled with the tobacco cigarette. The tobacco cigarette includes a mouthpiece <b>100</b>, a cooling filler <b>200</b> and tobacco segments <b>300</b> disposed along the axial direction. In use, the tobacco segments <b>300</b> are inserted into the vaporizer <b>400</b> for being baked, which generates around 260 degree smoking smog, then smoking smog will be cooled by the cooling filler <b>200</b>, eventually inhaled via the mouthpiece <b>100</b>. The cooling filler <b>200</b> usually has polymer materials for cooling the smoking smog, avoiding overheated smoking smog to be inhaled to scald users. Therefore, when inserting the tobacco cigarette into the vaporizer <b>400</b>, a certain distance between the vaporizer <b>400</b> and the cooling filler <b>200</b> is remained, instead of the vaporizer <b>400</b> contacting the polymer materials in the cooling filler <b>200</b> to burn the polymer materials or produce noxious substances. If the low-temperature baked smoking set adopts the aforementioned vaporizer <b>400</b> as shown from <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>9</b></figref> to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>18</b></figref>, the through holes <b>221</b> are arranged on the heating element <b>20</b> to change the heating areas, the heating areas will be centralized in those areas bored with the through holes <b>221</b> while less heat will be generated at the two longitudinal opposite ends of the heating element <b>20</b>, even through the longitudinal ends of the heating element <b>20</b> contacts the cooling filler <b>200</b>, the temperature is not high enough to burn the polymer materials or let the polymer materials produce noxious substances. So in the process of inserting the tobacco cigarette into the vaporizer <b>400</b>, the tobacco cigarette may be deeply inserted to abut against the bottom of sleeve of the vaporizer <b>400</b>, no need for a distance therebetween, which is more convenient.</p>
<p id="p-0092" num="0091">To monitor the heating process of the heating element itself, based on the above embodiments, a temperature sensor <b>50</b> is mounted on the heating element <b>20</b>, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>6</b></figref>, according to structure characters of the heating element <b>20</b> itself, the temperature sensor <b>50</b> may be inserted into the through holes to keep the surface of the heating element <b>20</b> flat, which is in favor of sleeve the heating element <b>20</b> on the sleeve <b>10</b>. Of course, the temperature sensor <b>50</b> further needs to connect the power supply and the main board in the controlling circuit, configured for receiving and processing the temperature signals, so as to real-time monitor the heating element <b>20</b>. The number of the temperature sensors <b>50</b> is equal to the number of the heating areas in the heating element <b>20</b>, which may monitor each heating area in the heating element <b>20</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0093" num="0092">The present disclosure further relates to a low-temperature baked smoking set including the aforementioned vaporizer <b>400</b>. The smoking set includes a power supply module configured for supplying power to the vaporizer <b>400</b>. So the power supply module is electrically connected with the vaporizer <b>400</b> via a threaded connection.</p>
<p id="p-0094" num="0093">By relying on the low-temperature baked smoking set including the aforementioned heating element according to embodiments of the present disclosure, with all kinds of arrays of through holes, they make the whole resistance of the heating element even, with consequently making the current to be even during the vaporizer is working, therefore, the vaporizer generates heat evenly, ensures the solid vaporizable materials, that is the tobacco cigarette to be heated evenly, to improve efficiency and stability of vaporizing smoking smog.
