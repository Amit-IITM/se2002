<p id="p-0003" num="0002">Myriad implements and devices for maintaining oral health are known. For example, toothbrushes of both the manual and powered variety, floss, dentifrices, applicators, agents, and the like are all known to provide different benefits in the oral cavity. The main components used for cleaning of the teeth are the cleaning elements of a toothbrush, which may include filament bristles as well as rubber elements known in the art as lamella. Different toothbrush users desire different mouthfeels during toothbrushing. Specifically, some people prefer a harder brush that provides the users with confidence that the cleaning elements are removing debris from the teeth. However, other people find such hard brushes to cause discomfort and prefer softer cleaning elements and a softer mouthfeel during brushing. Thus, a need exists for a tooth cleaning implement that provides the desired mouthfeel while also adequately cleaning plaque and other debris from the teeth and gums.</p>

<p id="p-0028" num="0027">Referring first to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>1</b>-<b>3</b></figref>, an oral care implement <b>100</b> is illustrated in accordance with an embodiment of the present invention. In the exemplified embodiment, the oral care implement <b>100</b> is a manual toothbrush. However, the invention is not to be so limited in all embodiments and in other embodiments the oral care implement <b>100</b> could be a powered toothbrush that either vibrates the cleaning elements or moves them in a rotational or linear back-and-forth manner. The oral care implement <b>100</b> is generally intended for cleaning of a user&#x2019;s oral cavity, specifically the teeth and gums, although it could certainly have other uses as well such as general cleaning or the like.</p>
<p id="p-0029" num="0028">The oral care implement <b>100</b> generally comprises a handle <b>110</b> and a head <b>120</b>. The handle <b>110</b> and the head <b>120</b> may be formed as an integral, monolithic structure during an injection molding process. Thus, in some embodiments the handle <b>110</b> and the head <b>120</b> may be formed from a rigid plastic material, such as those mentioned below. Of course, the invention is not to be limited by this structure in all embodiments and in alternative embodiments the head <b>120</b> may be detachable from the handle <b>110</b> so that the head <b>120</b> is a refill head as that term is commonly known in the art. In such embodiments it may be possible to replace the head <b>120</b> with a new head while maintaining the same handle <b>110</b>. The general shape of the handle <b>110</b> and the head <b>120</b> is not to be limited to that which is depicted in the drawings in all embodiments, with the drawings merely depicting one exemplary and non-limiting embodiment.</p>
<p id="p-0030" num="0029">The handle <b>110</b> is an elongated structure that provides the mechanism by which the user can hold and manipulate the oral care implement <b>100</b> during use. In the exemplified embodiment, the handle <b>110</b> is generically depicted having various contours for user comfort. Of course, the invention is not to be so limited in all embodiments and in certain other embodiments the handle <b>110</b> can take on a wide variety of shapes, contours and configurations, none of which are limiting of the present invention unless so specified in the claims. In the exemplified embodiment, the handle <b>110</b> and the head <b>120</b> are formed of a rigid plastic material, such as, for example without limitation, polymers and copolymers of ethylene, propylene, butadiene, vinyl compounds, and polyesters such as polyethylene terephthalate. Of course, the handle <b>110</b> may include a resilient material, such as a thermoplastic elastomer, as a grip cover that is molded over portions of or the entirety of the handle <b>110</b> to enhance the gripability of the handle <b>110</b> during use. For example, portions of the handle <b>110</b> that are typically gripped by a user&#x2019;s palm during use may be overmolded with a thermoplastic elastomer or other resilient material to further increase comfort to a user. Moreover, the head <b>120</b> could also include a resilient material such as a thermoplastic elastomer on its rear surface to provide a tongue or cheek cleaning function.</p>
<p id="p-0031" num="0030">The head <b>120</b> extends from a proximal end <b>128</b> to a distal end <b>129</b> and comprises a longitudinal axis A-A that extends between the proximal and distal ends <b>128</b>, <b>129</b>. The head <b>120</b> also comprises a transverse axis B-B that is perpendicular to the longitudinal axis A-A and equidistant to the proximal and distal ends <b>128</b>, <b>129</b> of the head <b>120</b>. The head <b>120</b> further comprises a front surface <b>121</b> and a rear surface <b>122</b> opposite the front surface <b>121</b>. Furthermore, the head <b>120</b> comprises a lateral surface <b>123</b> that extends between the front and rear surfaces <b>121</b>, <b>122</b>. The transverse axis B-B of the head <b>120</b> is oriented so as to intersect the lateral surface <b>123</b> of the head <b>120</b> twice while being perpendicular to the longitudinal axis A-A.</p>
<p id="p-0032" num="0031">The front surface <b>121</b> of the head <b>120</b> comprises a perimeter portion <b>124</b> and a central portion <b>125</b>. The perimeter portion <b>124</b> of the front surface <b>121</b> of the head <b>120</b> surrounds the central portion <b>125</b> of the front surface <b>121</b> of the head <b>120</b>. The perimeter portion <b>124</b> is an annular portion of the front surface <b>121</b> of the head <b>120</b> that extends from the lateral surface <b>123</b> to the central portion <b>125</b>. In the exemplified embodiment, a dashed line marked RL is provided in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref> to represent the dividing line between the perimeter and central portions <b>124</b>, <b>125</b> of the front surface <b>121</b> of the head <b>120</b>. However, it should be appreciated that the perimeter and central portions <b>124</b>, <b>125</b> of the front surface <b>121</b> of the head <b>120</b> do not have predetermined surface areas, and thus the exact location of the line RL could be changed from that illustrated and still fall within the scope of the invention set forth herein. Thus, the surface area, width, diameter, etc. of the perimeter and central portions <b>124</b>, <b>125</b> are not to be particularly limited to the exemplified embodiment shown in the drawings. The perimeter portion <b>124</b> is described above as being an annular portion, but it is not limited to being circular in all embodiments and could take on other shapes. Similarly, the central portion <b>125</b> is illustrated in the drawings as being oval in shape, but it could be circular, square, triangular, or other shapes in other embodiments. Thus, various permutations are possible so long as the perimeter portion <b>124</b> is a portion of the front surface <b>121</b> of the head <b>120</b> that surrounds the central portion <b>125</b> of the front surface <b>121</b> of the head <b>120</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0033" num="0032">The oral care implement <b>100</b> further comprises a plurality of cleaning elements <b>115</b> coupled to and extending from the head <b>120</b>. The plurality of cleaning elements <b>130</b> could be coupled to the head using any technique now known or later discovered, including staples, anchor-free tufting (AFT), in-mold tufting (IMT), PTt technology, or the like. In staple technology, the bristle tufts are folded into a U shape and then a staple is used to secure the bristle tufts within a tuft hole. In AFT technology, the bristle tufts are inserted through holes in a head plate and the ends of the tufts that extend from the back of the head plate are melted together to form a layer of bristle material that lies adjacent to the rear surface of the head plate. This prevents the bristle tufts from being pulled back through the tuft holes. The head plate is then secured to the head. In PTt technology, the bristle filaments are arranged in tufts and then melted together to form tufts having a mushroom shaped end. The tufts with the mushroom shaped ends are then inserted in pre-cored holes of a toothbrush head. Then, pressure and heat is applied to the toothbrush head, which causes the surface of the toothbrush head to reshape itself to enclose the mushroom-shaped ends of the tufts, holding them firmly. Thus, the invention is not intended to be particularly limited by the manner in which the cleaning elements <b>130</b> are coupled to the head <b>120</b>. However, the cleaning elements <b>130</b> should be coupled to the head <b>120</b> in such a manner so that they extend from the front surface <b>121</b> of the head <b>120</b>. The cleaning elements <b>130</b> could extend perpendicularly from the front surface <b>121</b> of the head <b>120</b> or at an angle relative to the front surface <b>121</b> of the head <b>120</b>, or combinations thereof, as may be desired.</p>
<p id="p-0034" num="0033">In the exemplified embodiment, the plurality of cleaning elements <b>130</b> comprises a plurality of bristle tufts <b>131</b>, each of which comprises a plurality of filament bristles <b>132</b>. Such filament bristles <b>132</b> may be end-rounded, tapered, spiral, bi-core, core-sheath, or of any other type now known or later developed. The filament bristles <b>132</b> may be formed from nylon or other well-accepted materials commonly used for forming toothbrush bristles. For example, the filament bristles <b>132</b> may be made from animal hair or other natural materials, nylon-polyester blends, or other plastic materials. The filament bristles <b>132</b> may also have any desired thickness/diameter or different filament bristles <b>132</b> may have different thicknesses/diameters, ranging from 4 mils to 9 mils, and more specifically 5 mils to 7 mils. It may also be possible for some of the cleaning elements <b>130</b> to be formed from a resilient material, such as rubber, thermoplastic elastomer, or the like. However, in some preferred embodiments the cleaning elements <b>130</b> do not include any such resilient or rubber elements, but rather all of the cleaning elements <b>130</b> are bristle tufts <b>131</b> comprising (or consisting of) filament bristles <b>132</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0035" num="0034">The plurality of bristle tufts <b>131</b> comprises a plurality of first bristle tufts <b>140</b> coupled to the head <b>120</b> and extending from the front surface <b>121</b> of the head <b>120</b> and a plurality of second bristle tufts <b>160</b> coupled to the head <b>120</b> and extending from the front surface <b>121</b> of the head <b>120</b>. In the exemplified embodiment, the cleaning elements <b>130</b> of the oral care implement <b>100</b> consist entirely of the first bristle tufts <b>140</b> and the second bristle tufts <b>160</b>, there being no other types of bristle tufts or cleaning elements provided on the head <b>120</b>. Of course, in other embodiments the first and second bristle tufts <b>140</b> may be intermixed with other types of cleaning elements as noted herein. Although in the exemplified embodiment there are a plurality of each of the first and second bristle tufts <b>140</b>, <b>160</b>, the invention is not to be so limited and in other embodiments the oral care implement <b>100</b> may include one or more of the first bristle tufts <b>140</b> and one or more of the second bristle tufts <b>160</b>. In still other embodiments, the oral care implement <b>100</b> may include one or more of the first bristle tufts <b>140</b> and none of the second bristle tufts <b>160</b> and in yet other embodiments the oral care implement <b>100</b> may include one or more of the second bristle tufts <b>160</b> and none of the first bristle tufts <b>140</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0036" num="0035">In the exemplified embodiment, each of the first bristle tufts <b>140</b> is located or positioned along the perimeter portion <b>124</b> of the front surface <b>121</b> of the head <b>120</b>. Furthermore, in the exemplified embodiment each of the second bristle tufts <b>160</b> is located or positioned along the central portion <b>125</b> of the front surface <b>121</b> of the head <b>120</b>. In fact, in the exemplified embodiment there are only first bristle tufts <b>140</b> along the perimeter portion <b>124</b> and there are only second bristle tufts <b>160</b> along the central portion <b>125</b>. Thus, the first bristle tufts <b>140</b> are positioned in such a way so as to surround the second bristle tufts <b>160</b>. Specifically, the first bristle tufts <b>140</b> are positioned in a spaced apart manner along the perimeter portion <b>124</b> of the front surface <b>121</b> of the head <b>120</b> with the first bristle tufts <b>140</b> collectively surrounding the central portion <b>125</b>. The second bristle tufts <b>160</b> are positioned in a spaced apart manner along the central portion <b>125</b> of the front surface <b>121</b> of the head <b>120</b> and are thereby surrounded by the first bristle tufts <b>140</b>. Stated another way, the first bristle tufts <b>140</b> are arranged along a loop that surrounds the central portion <b>125</b> of the front surface <b>121</b> of the head <b>120</b> and surrounds the second bristle tufts <b>160</b> that are located along the central portion <b>125</b> of the front surface <b>121</b> of the head <b>120</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0037" num="0036">In the exemplified embodiment, some of the first bristle tufts <b>140</b> are directly adjacent to one of the second bristle tufts <b>160</b>. Thus, despite the first bristle tufts <b>140</b> being located in the perimeter portion <b>124</b> and the second bristle tufts <b>160</b> being located in the central portion <b>125</b>, the first and second bristle tufts <b>140</b>, <b>160</b> are still positioned adjacent to one another. In some embodiments, at least one of the first bristle tufts <b>140</b> is directly adjacent to one of the second bristle tufts <b>160</b> with there being no other bristle tufts located therebetween. In fact, in the exemplified embodiment every single one of the first bristle tufts <b>140</b> is directly adjacent to one of the second bristle tufts <b>160</b>, although this is not required in all embodiments and variations may be possible within the scope of the invention described herein.</p>
<p id="p-0038" num="0037">In other embodiments, the positioning of the first and second bristle tufts <b>140</b>, <b>160</b> may be flipped, as shown and described in greater detail below with reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>10</b>-<b>12</b></figref>.

<p id="p-0039" num="0038">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>2</b>-<b>5</b></figref>, the first bristle tufts <b>140</b> will be described. Each of the first bristle tufts <b>140</b> has a similar structure to one another, said structure being described herein below. Other features of the first bristle tufts <b>140</b>, such as their heights/lengths, diameters/thicknesses, the style or type of filament bristles included therein, the thickness or diameter of the filament bristles included therein, the specific angle of the distal end, or the like may differ from one another, but the description provided below is applicable to each of the first bristle tufts <b>140</b>. Thus, although the description below will be directed to one of the first bristle tufts <b>140</b>, it should be appreciated that it is applicable to each of the first bristle tufts <b>140</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0040" num="0039">The first bristle tufts <b>140</b> comprise a plurality of first outer filaments <b>141</b> and a plurality of first inner filaments <b>142</b>. The plurality of first outer filaments <b>141</b> collectively surround the plurality of first inner filaments <b>142</b>. Thus, the plurality of first outer filaments <b>141</b> collectively form a sheath portion <b>143</b> of the first bristle tufts <b>140</b> and the plurality of first inner filaments <b>142</b> collectively form a core portion <b>144</b> of the first bristle tufts <b>140</b>. In the exemplified embodiment, the sheath portion <b>143</b> of the first bristle tufts <b>140</b> has a rectangular ring-like shape and the core portion <b>144</b> of the first bristle tufts <b>140</b> has a rectangular cross-sectional shape. However, the invention is not to be so limited in all embodiments and the sheath portion <b>143</b> may have a circular ring-like shape, a triangular ring-like shape, or any other desired geometry with the core portion <b>144</b> having a similar cross-sectional shape that fits within the open area defined by the sheath portion <b>143</b>. Thus, the overall shape and transverse cross-sectional shape of the first bristle tufts <b>140</b> and the sheath and core portions <b>143</b>, <b>144</b> thereof is not to be limiting of the present invention for all embodiments.</p>
<p id="p-0041" num="0040">In the exemplified embodiment, there is no gap or spacing between the first outer filaments <b>141</b> and the first inner filaments <b>142</b> (or between an inner surface of the sheath portion <b>143</b> and an outer surface of the core portion <b>144</b>), other than the natural spacing that occurs between bristle filaments in a bristle tuft. Thus, in some embodiments the only distinguishing feature between the sheath portion <b>143</b> and the core portion <b>144</b> is the length or height of the bristle filaments within that particular portion of the first bristle tuft <b>140</b>, as described in more detail below. Thus, although different hatch line styles are used to illustrate the sheath portion <b>143</b> and the core portion <b>144</b>, it should be appreciated that the first outer filaments <b>141</b> that form the sheath portion <b>143</b> and the first inner filaments <b>142</b> that form the core portion <b>144</b> may be identical other than their heights/lengths as described herein. In other embodiments, the first outer filaments <b>141</b> and the first inner filaments <b>142</b> may differ in other ways, such as thickness/diameter, color, material, or the like.</p>

The distal end <b>146</b> of the sheath portion <b>143</b> of the first bristle tuft <b>140</b> forms a first outer distal surface <b>147</b> of the first bristle tuft <b>140</b>.

The distal end <b>149</b> of the core portion <b>144</b> of the first bristle tuft <b>140</b> forms a first inner distal surface <b>150</b> of the first bristle tuft <b>140</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0043" num="0042">In the exemplified embodiment, each of the first outer filaments <b>141</b> is taller than each of the first inner filaments <b>142</b>. Thus, in the exemplified embodiment the sheath portion <b>143</b> of the first bristle tuft <b>140</b> is taller than the core portion <b>144</b> of the first bristle tuft <b>140</b>. Stated another way, the first outer distal surface <b>147</b> of the first bristle tuft <b>140</b> is axially offset from the first inner distal surface <b>150</b> of the first bristle tuft <b>140</b>. This is true despite the fact that in the exemplified embodiment the first outer filaments <b>141</b> are not all the same height and the first inner filaments <b>142</b> are not all the same height. Thus, in the exemplified embodiment the tallest of the first inner filaments <b>142</b> is still shorter than the shortest of the first outer filaments <b>141</b> so that each of the first inner filaments <b>142</b> is shorter than each of the first outer filaments <b>141</b>. Thus, no portion of the first inner distal surface <b>150</b> of the first bristle tuft <b>140</b> extends beyond the first outer distal surface <b>147</b> of the first bristle tuft <b>140</b>. The height of the various filaments for purposes of determine which filaments are taller or shorter when compared to one another is measured from the front surface <b>121</b> of the head <b>120</b> to a distal end of the filament, which is the portion of the filament located furthest from the front surface <b>121</b> of the head <b>120</b>.</p>

This forms a small pocket or cavity within the first bristle tuft <b>140</b> between the first inner distal surface <b>150</b> of the first bristle tuft <b>140</b> and an inner surface <b>159</b> of the portion of the sheath portion <b>143</b> that extends from the first inner distal surface <b>150</b> of the first bristle tuft to the first outer distal surface <b>147</b> of the first bristle tuft <b>140</b>. In some aspects, the first bristle tuft <b>140</b>, or a portion thereof, may be cup-shaped due to this difference in height between the sheath portion <b>143</b> and the core portion <b>144</b>.</p>

In the exemplified embodiment, the terminal end <b>152</b> of the first bristle tuft <b>140</b> is formed by the first outer distal surface <b>147</b> of the first bristle tuft <b>140</b> because the first inner distal surface <b>150</b> of the first bristle tuft <b>140</b> is recessed relative to the first outer distal surface <b>147</b> of the first bristle tuft <b>140</b>. Thus, the terminal end <b>152</b> of the first bristle tuft <b>140</b> is formed by the distal ends of the filament bristles <b>141</b> that extend furthest from the head <b>120</b>.</p>

Thus, no portion of the second outer distal surface <b>167</b> of the second bristle tuft <b>160</b> extends beyond the second inner distal surface <b>170</b> of the second bristle tuft <b>160</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0053" num="0052">The second inner distal surface <b>170</b> of the second bristle tuft <b>160</b> formed by the core portion <b>164</b> of the second bristle tuft <b>160</b> extends further from the front surface <b>121</b> of the head <b>120</b> than the second outer distal surface <b>167</b> of the second bristle tuft <b>160</b> formed by the sheath portion <b>163</b> of the second bristle tuft <b>160</b>. The second bristle tuft <b>160</b> extends from a bottom end <b>171</b> (formed by the bottom ends <b>165</b>, <b>168</b> of the sheath and core portions <b>163</b>, <b>164</b>) to a terminal end <b>172</b> along a longitudinal axis D-D. In the exemplified embodiment, the terminal end <b>172</b> of the second bristle tuft <b>160</b> may be considered to be formed by the second inner distal surface <b>170</b> of the second bristle tuft <b>160</b> because it extends furthest from the head <b>120</b>. In other embodiments, the terminal end <b>172</b> of the second bristle tuft <b>160</b> may be used to refer to the combination of the second inner distal surface <b>170</b> and the second outer distal surface <b>167</b> of the second bristle tuft <b>160</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0054" num="0053">In the exemplified embodiment, the second outer distal surface <b>167</b> of the second bristle tuft <b>160</b> is oriented at an oblique angle relative to the longitudinal axis D-D of the second bristle tuft <b>160</b>. Similarly, in the exemplified embodiment the second inner distal surface <b>170</b> of the second bristle tuft <b>160</b> is oriented at an oblique angle relative to the longitudinal axis D-D of the second bristle tuft <b>160</b>. In the exemplified embodiment, the second outer distal surface <b>167</b> of the second bristle tuft <b>160</b> is parallel to the second inner distal surface <b>170</b> of the second bristle tuft <b>160</b>. Thus, in the exemplified embodiment the second inner distal surface <b>170</b> of the second bristle tuft <b>160</b> and the second outer distal surface <b>167</b> of the second bristle tuft <b>160</b> are oriented at the same oblique angle relative to the longitudinal axis D-D. The exact oblique angle is not to be limiting of the present invention in all embodiments, but could be in a range of 70-89&#xb0; in some embodiments, 75-89&#xb0; in some embodiments, 80-89&#xb0; in some embodiments, 80-85&#xb0; in some embodiments, or the like. In alternative embodiments, the second inner and outer distal surfaces <b>167</b>, <b>170</b> of the second bristle tuft <b>160</b> may be oriented at different oblique angles relative to the longitudinal axis D-D. In still other embodiments, at least one, or both, of the second inner and outer distal surfaces <b>167</b>, <b>170</b> of the second bristle tuft <b>160</b> may be oriented perpendicular to the longitudinal axis D-D.</p>
<p id="p-0055" num="0054">In the exemplified embodiment, the second outer distal surface <b>167</b> of the second bristle tuft <b>160</b> is planar, meaning that it lies in a plane. Similarly, the second inner distal surface <b>170</b> of the second bristle tuft <b>160</b> is planar, meaning that it lies in a plane. These planes are parallel in the exemplified embodiment but need not be in all embodiments as described herein above. Of course, the second outer and inner distal surfaces <b>167</b>, <b>170</b> of the second bristle tuft <b>160</b> may not be planar in all embodiments, but may instead be rounded, wavy, or the like.</p>
<p id="p-0056" num="0055">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>8</b> and <b>9</b></figref>, cross-sectional views of the head <b>120</b> of the oral care implement <b>100</b> are provided taken along the longitudinal axis A-A and the transverse axis B-B.

Because both the outer distal surfaces <b>147</b> and the inner distal surfaces <b>150</b> of the first bristle tufts <b>140</b> are angled as described above, both the outer distal surfaces <b>147</b> and the inner distal surfaces <b>150</b> are inclined and slope upwardly towards the central portion <b>125</b> and towards the second bristle tufts <b>160</b>. Stated still another way, the terminal end <b>152</b> of each of the first bristle tufts <b>140</b> is inclined and slopes upwardly in a direction towards the longitudinal axis A-A of the head <b>120</b> and/or towards the transverse axis B-B of the head <b>120</b>.</p>
