<heading id="h-0002" level="1">BACKGROUND</heading>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">Chronic deficiency in the secretion of digestive enzymes by the pancreas is termed Exocrine Pancreatic Insufficiency (EPI). Without these digestive enzymes, patients suffering from EPI cannot properly digest nutrients in food and may suffer from malnutrition and abdominal disorders. EPI is prevalent in individuals with chronic pancreatitis and several other chronic gastrointestinal disorders. EPI also manifests in patients suffering from cystic fibrosis. The effects of EPI can be mitigated by Pancreatic Enzyme Replacement Therapy (PERT), in which the individual administers enzyme capsules each time food is consumed. Conventionally, PERT treatment comprises pancreatic enzymes extracted from porcine pancreas.</p>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">Lipids are energy-dense compounds that are the source of essential long chain fatty acids. Consumed lipids, typically comprising a high percentage of triacylglyceride (TAG) are digested with lipases secreted from the pancreas into free fatty acids (FFA) and monoacylglyceride (MAG). Blockage of lipase release from the pancreas results in very poor digestion of triacylglyceride-containing fats and oils. For patients suffering from EPI, this can lead to significant malnutrition because the calories, essential fatty acids and fat-soluble nutrients are trapped in the un-digested lipid particles and pass through the system.</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">There is an un-met clinical need for alternative sources of nutrition that can be consumed without needing to supplement with PERT by individuals with EPI.</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">Partially hydrolyzed fats and oils, in the form of MAGs are readily absorbed by individuals with EPI, without the requirement of PERT. MAG oil-based products have been evaluated in the clinic as capsule-based nutritional supplements; however, capsules were utilized to avoid the bad taste. For conventional sources of MAG oils, the starting oil is treated chemically or enzymatically to make MAGs, which are then extracted with solvents and distilled to fractionate the MAGs away from other components of the starting oils. These MAG products are sold as relatively pure products containing only negligible amounts of contaminating free fatty acid (FFA), diacylglycerides (DAGs) and TAGs, and with virtually no other compounds. Thus, conventional sources of MAG oil often lack the other natural compounds found in the oil, such as tocopherol.</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">There is clinical need for nutritional products with very-high-energy caloric density that can be consumed by individuals with inefficient or compromised digestive systems. In addition to individuals with pancreas pathologies (e.g., cystic fibrosis, pancreatitis and pancreatic cancer patients) other patients with diagnosed or undiagnosed Exocrine Pancreatic insufficiency (EPI) would benefit from the products. In addition, individuals with bile dysfunction (cholestasis) may benefit from &#x201c;pre-digested&#x201d; fats that do not require bile acids for emulsification. There are high calorie &#x201c;energy bars&#x201d; and drinks on the market. But, these products are not suitable for individuals who are unable to digest (hydrolyze) the fats in the product. Until now, no one has formulated lipids into liquid (shakes) and solid (bar) forms that are suitable for &#x201c;PERT-free&#x201d; use. These formulations can be a source of &#x201c;Complete Nutrition&#x201d;, suppling all the caloric and essential fatty acid requirements of individuals. Liquid nutrition can be in the form of oral nutritional supplements (ONS) products of products for enteral feeding.</p>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">Accordingly, there is need for high caloric density foods that can be consumed by individuals with inefficient or compromised digestive systems. The present application describes a method to produce an edible enzyme-modified oil (EMO) that is substantially free of TAGs.</p>
<p id="p-0009" num="0008">Monochloropropandiol (MCPD) and glycidyl esters are formed during the refining of edible oils. These compounds are toxic to humans and need to be minimized in food products. 3-MCPD is currently classified as a possible human carcinogen (group 2B) according to The International Agency for Research on Cancer (IARC). Glycidol is categorized as probably carcinogenic for humans (group 2A) by IARC and the US National Toxicology program. Current standards recommend exposure of less than 2 ug/kg body weight per day, which is less than 140 ug per day for a 70 kg man, and only 10 ug/day for a 5 kg (&#x2dc;10 lb) baby.</p>
<p id="p-0010" num="0009">MCPD compounds were first detected in acid (HCl) hydrolyzed protein, but in 2008 the presence of MCPD esters in refined vegetable oils was discovered. It turned out the problem was widespread. Many edible oils are processed to remove components that negatively impact appearance, taste, shelf stability, safety and consumer acceptance. Mono- and di-acyl glycerols (MAGs and DAGs) in the oils can react with chlorine ions in the deodorization process to produce 3-Monochloropropanediol (3-MCPD) esters and glycidyl esters (GEs).</p>
<p id="p-0011" num="0010">Table 1 below shows the levels of MCPD compounds in a sampling of edible oils in the United States (from <i>Food Additives </i>&#x26; <i>Contaminants: Part A, </i>2013 Vol. 30, No. 12, 2081-2092).</p>

<p id="p-0013" num="0011">The estimated US infant exposures to 3-MCPD and glycidyl esters consumption of infant formula was recently reported (J. Spungen et al. <i>Food Additives </i>&#x26; <i>Contaminants: Part T A </i>2018, VOL. 35, NO. 6, 1085-1092). In this analysis, US FDA data on 3-MCPD and Glycidyl Ester concentrations (as 3-MCPD and glycidol equivalents, respectively) in a small convenience sample of infant formulas were used to estimate exposures from consumption of formula by infants 0-6 months of age. 3-MCPD and GE exposures based on mean concentrations in all formulas were estimated at 7-10 and 2 &#x3bc;g/kg bw/day, respectively. Estimated mean exposures from consumption of formulas produced by individual manufacturers ranged from 1 to 14 &#x3bc;g/kg bw/day for 3-MCPD and from 1 to 3 &#x3bc;g/kg for GE.</p>
<p id="p-0014" num="0012">Accordingly, there is need for methods to reduce and eliminate these compounds in edible oils. The method of the present application to produce an edible enzyme-modified oil (EMO) that is substantially free of TAGs and contaminants such as MCPD and therefore addresses this need.</p>
<p id="p-0015" num="0013">Some vegetable oils are rich in oleic acid. These oils have demonstrated health benefits. Some of this can be attributed to the oleic acid and oils that are rich in this fatty acid such as olive oil, almond oil and canola (rapeseed) oil. Triolein is a TAG that is very rich in oleic acid, as illustrated below. Triolein is 100% oleic acid esterified to glycerol at all three positions. The three positions are defined as &#x201c;sn-1, sn-2 and sn-3&#x201d;. Sn is &#x201c;stereo number.&#x201d;</p>

<heading id="h-0005" level="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE DISCLOSED SUBJECT MATTER</heading>
<p id="p-0080" num="0077">It is to be understood that both the foregoing general description and the following detailed description are exemplary and explanatory only, and are not restrictive of the invention, as claimed. In this application, the use of the singular includes the plural, the word &#x201c;a&#x201d; or &#x201c;an&#x201d; means &#x201c;at least one&#x201d;, and the use of &#x201c;or&#x201d; means &#x201c;and/or&#x201d;, unless specifically stated otherwise. Furthermore, the use of the term &#x201c;including&#x201d;, as well as other forms, such as &#x201c;includes&#x201d; and &#x201c;included&#x201d;, is not limiting. Also, terms such as &#x201c;element&#x201d; or &#x201c;component&#x201d; encompass both elements or components comprising one unit and elements or components that comprise more than one unit unless specifically stated otherwise.</p>
<p id="p-0081" num="0078">The section headings used herein are for organizational purposes only and are not to be construed as limiting the subject matter described. All documents, or portions of documents, cited in this application, including, but not limited to, patents, patent applications, articles, books, and treatises, are hereby expressly incorporated herein by reference in their entirety for any purpose. In the event that one or more of the incorporated literature and similar materials defines a term in a manner that contradicts the definition of that term in this application, this application controls.</p>
<p id="p-0082" num="0079">&#x201c;Enriched&#x201d; in the context of this invention means with an amount higher than in the starting material. For example, a MAG-enriched oil is an oil having a MAG content that is greater than the starting MAG content prior to the enrichment process or that the starting oil has a greater percentage of MAG than the oil possessed prior to the enrichment process. The enrichment process can be by conversion of TAGs to MAGs thereby increasing the MAG content and percentage and decreasing the TAG content or percentage.</p>
<p id="p-0083" num="0080">A triacylglycerol (&#x201c;TAG&#x201d;), also known as a triglyceride, is a glyceride consisting of three fatty acid chains covalently bonded to a glycerol molecule through ester linkages. TAGs may also be classified as having a long or medium chain length. Long chain TAGs contain fatty acids with 14 or more carbons, while medium chain TAGs contain fatty acids with 6 to 12 carbons. Long chain TAGs can include omega-3 and omega-6 fatty acids. Medium chain TAGs have saturated fatty acids and thus do not contain omega-3 or omega-6 fatty acids. Long chain TAGs (LCT) and medium chain triglycerides (MCT) can serve as energy sources.</p>
<p id="p-0084" num="0081">A diacylglycerol (&#x201c;DAG&#x201d;), also known as a diglyceride, is a glyceride consisting of two fatty acid chains covalently bonded to a glycerol molecule through ester linkages.</p>
<p id="p-0085" num="0082">A monoacylglycerol (&#x201c;MAG&#x201d;), also known as a monoglyceride, is a glyceride consisting of one fatty acid chain covalently bonded to a glycerol molecule through an ester linkage</p>
<p id="p-0086" num="0083">As used herein, the term &#x201c;processed oil&#x201d; refers to a non-naturally occurring oil composition substantially free TAGs or having a reduced amount of TAGs with respect to the pre-modified or pre-processed oil.</p>
<p id="p-0087" num="0084">As used herein, the terms &#x201c;enzyme-modified oil&#x201d; or &#x201c;EMO&#x201d; refers to a processed oil wherein TAGs were enzymatically converted to MAGs, such as, for example, using the enzymatic conversion of the present disclosure.</p>
<p id="p-0088" num="0085">As used herein, the term &#x201c;food product&#x201d; refers to a manufactured or non-naturally occurring food product. It should be understood that the food product referred to herein, while manufactured and non-naturally occurring as a whole, can comprise various combinations of natural ingredients where said combinations either do not occur in nature or where said combinations do exist in nature, they do not exist in the relative amounts used in the food product.</p>
<p id="p-0089" num="0086">The terms &#x201c;patient,&#x201d; &#x201c;individual,&#x201d; and &#x201c;subject&#x201d; are used interchangeably herein, and refer to a mammalian subject to be treated, with human patients being preferred. In some cases, the methods of the invention find use in experimental animals, in veterinary application, and in the development of animal models for disease, including, but not limited to, rodents including mice, rats, and hamsters, and primates.</p>
<p id="p-0090" num="0087">&#x201c;Treatment&#x201d; is an intervention performed with the intention of preventing the development or altering the pathology or symptoms of a disorder. Accordingly, &#x201c;treatment&#x201d; can refer to both therapeutic treatment and prophylactic or preventative measures. Those in need of treatment include those already with the disorder as well as those in which the disorder is to be prevented. In tumor (e.g., cancer) treatment, a therapeutic agent may directly decrease the pathology of tumor cells, or render the tumor cells more susceptible to treatment by other therapeutic agents, e.g., radiation and/or chemotherapy.</p>
<p id="p-0091" num="0088">As used herein, a &#x201c;non-oil ingredient&#x201d; is an ingredient that is naturally present in an oil source that is not a MAG, DAG, TAG, FFA or lipid.</p>

In any of the above aspects, the TAG content is equal to or less than 4%, equal to or less than 3%, equal to or less than 2%, equal to or less than 1% by weight based on the total weight of the processed oil.</p>
<p id="p-0104" num="0101">The resulting product from the above embodiments results in a processed oil that is substantially free of MCPD compounds generally, but also when the starting oils have more than 0.30 mg/kg MCPD compounds and in some instances from about 1.0 mg/kg to about 12.00 mg/kg. More specifically, the processed oil resulting from the above methods comprises less than 100 mg/kg MCPD and even to levels that are not detectable by standard assays. As used herein, the term &#x201c;substantially free&#x201d; with respect to the amount of MCPD levels in a processed oil of the present invention means levels that are below the limits of detection for the assay described in Example 11 below.</p>
<p id="p-0105" num="0102">The resulting product from the above embodiments results in a processed oil that is enriched in MAGs, specifically 1-MAGs (MAGs esterified at the sn-1 position). In the case of processed oils made from starting oils having oleic acid content, this results in the production of 1-oleyl monoacylglyceride (1-0G). It has been found that manufacturing process embodiments of the present disclosure can efficiently convert even sn-2 oleic acid TAGs to 1-0G. For example, starting with triolein, the manufacturing process embodiments of the present disclosure can yield three 1-0G molecules from a single triolein molecule, while digestion of triolein by pancreatic lipases can only yield one-third of the total oleic acid in monoacylglycerol form, specifically as 2-monoacylglycerol (2-0G) but not 1-0G, because the lipase liberates the oleic acid moieties at the sn-1 and sn-3 positions as free fatty acids. Thus, a processed oil produced by the manufacturing methods of the present disclosure can yield up to three times the 1-OG content compared to normal digestion processes. The below reaction schematic shows the conversion of triolein to 2-OG and two free oleic acid molecules (process A&#x2014;normal digestion) and of triolein to 3 molecules of 1-OG by the process of the present disclosure (process B).</p>

Agitation was set to 200 RPM and the mixture was heated to 33&#xb0; C. and agitated for about 15 Min to remove any dissolved gas. The vacuum was then replaced by a Nitrogen gas atmosphere. Once the mixture was sufficiently dispersed, 220 mL of the enzyme preparation in buffer solution was added. Agitation was continued and the reaction monitored for 24 hours until conversion to FFA was complete based on TLC analysis.</p>
<p id="p-0146" num="0141">Reactor temperature was increased to 70&#xb0; C. and agitation resumed for 1 hour to inactivate the enzyme.</p>
<p id="p-0147" num="0142">Agitation was stopped and the phases separated in about 60 Minutes.</p>
<p id="p-0148" num="0143">The aqueous (lower) phase was removed along with a small amount of the oil phase to ensure residual protein at the interface was eliminated.</p>
<p id="p-0149" num="0144">Step 2. Esterification with Glycerol. Typically when FFA are re-esterified with glycerol they produce a mixture of MAGs, DAGs and TAGs. We found that by significantly reducing the temperature (below 25&#xb0; C.) and removing the water (by evaporation) as it is formed in the reaction, that the proportion of MAGs in the product can be highly enriched (at least 60% but as high as 95%). This was un-expected.</p>
<p id="p-0150" num="0145">In the reaction, the reaction product from step 1 (about 10 L) was cooled to about 30&#xb0; C. and agitated at 300 RPM. 10 kg of Food-grade glycerol were added to the Lipid mixture, and the temperature maintained at &#x2dc;30&#xb0; C. The mixture was agitated to generate a dispersion of the oil and glycerol. To dry the reaction mixture a vacuum was applied: First a vacuum (25 mmHg, Torr) was applied with receiver in place to collect water. Once evaporation of the residual water had stopped, 20 g of Amano Lipase G dissolved in water (50 mL) was added to the reactor. The temperature was lowered to 23&#xb0; C. and the vacuum was changed to 5 mmHg using an oil diaphragm pump and a cold trap to collect the water. The mixture was stirred at 300 RPM at 23&#xb0; C. under vacuum for 72 hrs, at which time the vacuum was broken and the mixture was blanketed with nitrogen gas. The mixture was analyzed after 72 hrs with TLC to evaluate the conversion to MAGs as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0151" num="0146">Step 3. Lipase Inactivation and Phase Separation. After the reaction was complete, the lipase was inactivated by heating the mixture (under a Nitrogen gas blanket) to 70&#xb0; C. for 1 hr. At this point the MAG oil and glycerol are well mixed and very hard to separate through traditional gravity or centrifugal methods. After considerable experimentation, we found that the lipid can be separated from the excess glycerol by adding 0.3% wt of salt (NaCl) to the reaction mixture under agitation. The product mixture was then allowed to cool to about 60&#xb0; C. and left without agitation for about 1 hr.</p>
<p id="p-0152" num="0147">The lipid oil phase separated from the remaining heavier glycerol phase. The glycerol phase was removed: it contains some salt, residual water and the dissolved inactivated enzyme which is contained in the visible interface. The glycerol phase can be reused after membrane filtration and should be kept for recycle. Tocopherol (Vitamin E) was added to give a concentration of 200 ppm (0.02% wt) of the product oil. The hydrolyzed oil (about 10 kg was ready for use and could be stored under nitrogen blanket).</p>
<p id="p-0153" num="0148">Product Storage. The final hydrolyzed products were transferred to food-grade containers with an overlay of nitrogen gas for storage and transportation.</p>

Those in Arm 1 (10 patients) were administered the RTDS along with a PERT placebo and those in Arm 2 (10 patients) were administered standard nutritional supplement with PERT. Serial blood samples over 6 hours (0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6 hours) were obtained from patients in both study arms, with no repeat serving of the RTDS or standard nutritional supplement. Water could be consumed during the study.</p>
<p id="p-0190" num="0211">Patients returned to the clinic for Treatment 2 (cross-over treatment) after overnight fast and standardized evening meal. Patients in Arm 1 were administered the standard nutritional supplement with PERT, while patients in Arm 2 were administered the RTDS along with PERT placebo. Serial blood samples over 6 hours (0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6 hours) were obtained from patients in both study arms, with no repeat serving of the RTDS or standard nutritional supplement.</p>
<p id="p-0191" num="0212">The standard nutritional supplement contained: Water, Glucose Syrup, Sugar, Vegetable Oil (Canola, High Oleic Sunflower, Corn), Milk Protein Concentrate, and less than 2% of Soy Protein Isolate, Calcium Caseinate, Sodium Caseinate, Gum Acacia, Fructooligosaccharides, Inulin (from Chicory), Soy Lecithin, Salt, Natural and Artificial Flavor, Carrageenan Potassium Citrate, Calcium Phosphate, Magnesium Phosphate, Magnesium Chloride, Sodium Ascorbate, Choline Bitartrate, DL-Alpha Tocopheryl Acetate, Ascorbic Acid, Potassium Chloride, Ferrous Sulfate, Zinc Sulfate, Niacinamide, Calcium Pantothenate, Manganese Sulfate, Copper Sulfate, Pyridoxine Hydrochloride, Thiamine Hydrochloride, Beta-Carotene, Vitamin A Palmitate, Riboflavin, Folic Acid, Chromium Chloride, Biotin, Potassium Iodide, Phytonadione, Sodium Selenite, Sodium Molybdate, Vitamin D3, Vitamin B12.</p>
<p id="p-0192" num="0213">The RTDS contained: Water, Organic Date Syrup, Enzymatically Modified Almond Oil, Enzymatically Hydrolyzed Pea Protein, Soluble Corn Fiber, Cocoa Powder, Natural Flavors, Salt, Vitamin C, Vitamin E (dl-alpha-tocopheryl acetate), Niacinamide, Pantothenic acid (calcium-D-pantothenate), Vitamin B6 (pyridoxine hydrochloride), Vitamin A (retinyl palmitate), Vitamin B2 (riboflavin), Vitamin B1 (thiamine hydrochloride), L-methylfolate, Vitamin K1, Vitamin D3 (cholecalciferol), Biotin, Vitamin B12 (cyanocobalamin).</p>
<p id="p-0193" num="0214">The nutritional supplement was 5.9% fat, 5.9% protein and 19% carbs by weight while the RTDS was 7.4% fat, 4.7% protein and 9.8% carbs by weight.</p>
<p id="p-0194" num="0215">The dosage of lipid was 0.5 g/kg body weight. The lipid in the standard nutritional supplement was a blend of TAGs from canola, high oleic sunflower and corn oil. In the interventional drink the MAGs were produced from almond oil. The dosage of lipid for each patient was based upon well-established &#x201c;Lipid Tolerance Tests&#x201d;, which are similar in design and scope to well-known glucose tolerance tests. The recommended dosage for these tests is 0.5-1.0 g/kg administered over 20-30 minutes. Samples were taken at the start of the test and hourly for 6 hours. Serum triglyceride levels were measured using standard laboratory methods.</p>
<p id="p-0195" num="0216">The PERT dosage used in the study followed the manufacturer's recommended dosage guidelines of 2,500 iu of lipase activity per gram of fat ingested. This translated to 3-4 capsules during the crossover stage of the study.</p>
<p id="p-0196" num="0217"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>7</b></figref> depicts the increase in serum triglycerides following ingestion of the EMO-based ready-to-drink shake in two patients. In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>7</b></figref>, the dashed lines represent patients that received 0.5 g per Kg of body weight of enzyme-modified almond oil and the solid lines represent patients that received 0.5 g per Kg of body weight of canola, high oleic sunflower and corn oil incorporated into the RTDS consumed over a half-hour period. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>7</b></figref> illustrates that the enzyme-modified oil in the RTDS was absorbed by the patients and converted into serum triglycerides.</p>
<p id="p-0197" num="0218"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>8</b></figref> depicts the increase in serum triglycerides in another patient following ingestion of the test drinks. In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>8</b></figref>, the dashed line represents serum triglycerides following ingestion of MAG-based RTDS without PERT and the solid line represents standard of care RTDS with PERT. The patients received 0.5 g per Kg of body weight of enzyme-modified almond oil or 0.5 g per Kg of body weight of corn oil, incorporated in the RTDS consumed over a half-hour period.</p>
<p id="p-0198" num="0219">In this patient, the absorption of lipid and conversion to serum triglycerides was significantly faster following ingestion of the MAG-based RTDS without PERT serum than from the TAG-based (standard of care) product with PERT. This suggests that the patient was suffering from cholestasis (disruption of bile flow from the liver) in addition to EPI and not just suffering from lack of sufficient enzymes, and thus could not properly emulsify the canola, high oleic sunflower and corn oil in the standard of care drink. Emulsification of the oil into very small droplets is required to produce the surface area that the pancreatic lipase need hydrolyze the oil into the MAGs and FFA that are transported into the enterocytes. Bile acids from the liver are required for this activity. The TAGs in the standard of care drink could not be emulsified into the micro-emulsions required for optimal lipase activity in the small intestine, and thus serum triglycerides did not increase as quickly as with the MAG formulation, which does not require lipase activity.</p>
<p id="p-0199" num="0220">The actual dosage of lipids per patient was the same in all cases: 0.5 g/kg body mass.</p>
<p id="p-0200" num="0221">Sugar intake for a hypothetical 65 kg patient in the study is shown in Table 5 below for the standard nutritional supplement and for the RTDS. Most of the sugar and carbohydrates in the control drink are dextrose or starch, and are readily converted to glucose. In the study drink, the volume of drink the hypothetical 65 kg patient would consume is less (the study drink has a higher concentration of lipids) and the carbohydrates are supplied in lower amounts and as a 50:50 mixture of fructose and glucose. Thus, the actual glucose consumed is less.</p>

Patients who consumed the RTDS showed a pronounced decrease in maximum post-prandial serum glucose and remained below the standard nutritional supplement cohort. These results demonstrate that the EMO-based nutritional supplement, which is high in 1-monoacylglycerols such as 1-oleyl monoglycerol, was able to positively impact glucose homeostasis compared to the standard nutritional supplement with PERT which would only be expected to yield a small amount of 2-monoacylglycerols such as 2-oleyl monoglycerol. Based on the amount of glucose administered, a higher serum glucose level would have been expected for the RTDS cohort and the effect shown is unexpected.</p>

<heading id="h-0017" level="1">Example 11: Removal of MCPD from Almond Oil</heading>
<p id="p-0216" num="0233">Enzyme modified almond oil was prepared as described in Example 6.</p>
<p id="p-0217" num="0234">Samples of the enzyme-modified almond oil were sent to a third party lab (Eurofins Eurofins Scientific Inc. Nutrition Analysis Center 2200 Rittenhouse Street, Suite 150 Des Moines, Iowa 50321) for analysis using the standard method described below.</p>
<p id="p-0218" num="0235">AOCS Official Method Cd 29b-13 (Revised 2017)-2- and 3-MCPD Fatty Acid Esters and Glycidol Fatty Acid Esters in Edible Oils and Fats by Alkaline Transesterification and GC/MS. This method is used for the determination of fatty acid esters of 2-chloropropane-1,3-diol (2-MCPD), 3-chloropropane-1,2-diol (3-MCPD) and glycidol in edible oils and fats. See also AOCS Official Methods Cd 29a-13 or Cd 29c-13. Bound glycidol is the sum of all glycidyl derivatives that are cleaved by alkaline-catalyzed alcoholysis. The content of bound glycidol is reported in milligrams per kilogram (mg/kg). Bound 2-MCPD is the sum of all 2-MCPD-derivatives that are cleaved by alkaline-catalyzed alcoholysis. The content of bound 2-MCPD is reported in milligrams per kilogram (mg/kg). Bound 3-MCPD is the sum of all 3-MCPD-derivatives that are cleaved by alkaline-catalyzed alcoholysis. The content of bound 3-MCPD is reported in milligrams per kilogram (mg/kg). This method describes a procedure for the parallel determination of glycidol together with 2-MCPD and 3-MCPD present in bound or free form in oils and fats. The method is based on alkaline-catalyzed ester cleavage, transformation of the released glycidol into monobromopropanediol (MBPD) and derived free diols (MCPD and MBPD) with phenylboronic acid (PB A). Though free MCPD and glycidol are only present in fats and oils in low to negligible quantities, significant content would increase proportionately the determination of bound analytes. This method is applicable to solid and liquid fats and oils.</p>
<p id="p-0219" num="0236">Results. The total 2-MCPD (free and bound) and 3-MCPD (free and bound) in the starting oil was 0.65 mg/kg and 1.17 mg/kg, respectively. The enzyme modified almond oil (Example 6) had a total 2-MCPD (free and bound) and 3-MCPD (free and bound) each of &#x3c;0.10 mg/kg, which is below the limit of quantification of the assay to measure MCPD (0.10 mg/kg). Thus, the sums of the total detected MCPD in the starting almond oil and in the enzyme modified oil was 1.82 mg/kg and &#x3c;0.10 mg/kg, respectively.</p>
<p id="p-0220" num="0237">Therefore, the present invention is well adapted to attain the ends and advantages mentioned as well as those that are inherent therein. While numerous changes may be made by those skilled in the art, such changes are encompassed within the spirit of this invention as illustrated, in part, by the appended claims.</p>
<heading id="h-0018" level="1">Example 12: Fatty Acid Profiles in Starting Oils and MAG Oils</heading>
<p id="p-0221" num="0238">MCT, canola and almond oils were processed according to the manufacturing method of the present disclosure. Fatty acid profiles for each were measured in both the starting oil and the MAG oil as shown in Table 9 below.</p>
<p id="p-0222" num="0239">Fatty acids were analyzed after derivatization as the fatty acid methyl esters and compared to standards. For the derivatization, a sample (500 &#x3bc;l) was added to a 5-ml reaction tube containing 2 ml boron trifluoride solution (12% in methanol), 20 &#x3bc;l dimethoxypropane and 100 &#x3bc;l of a tridecanoic acid internal standard solution (10 mg/ml). The reaction tube was vortexed and incubated in a heating block at 60&#xb0; C. for 30 minutes. The reaction tube was removed from the heating block and allowed to cool for 15 minutes. Then, 1 ml of distilled water was added to quench the reaction, followed by 1 ml of hexane. The reaction tube was vortexed for 60 seconds and the phases were allowed to separate for 3 minutes. The top (hydrophobic) phase was removed to a 1.5-ml tube containing about 50 mg sodium sulfate (anhydrous). After vortexing for 60 seconds, the 1.5-ml tube was centrifuged and &#x2dc;500 &#x3bc;l of the clarified, dried hydrophobic phase was transferred to a gas chromatography sample vial. Samples were analyzed using an Agilent 7890A gas chromatograph with Flame ionization detector and Agilent Openlab CDS Chemstation software. GC Column: Omegawax 100 (15 m&#xd7;0.1 mm&#xd7;0.1 um) column. Results were converted to weight % by internal standard reference.</p>
