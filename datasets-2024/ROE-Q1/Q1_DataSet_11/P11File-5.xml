<heading id="h-0002" level="1">BACKGROUND ART</heading>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">Conventionally, there has been proposed a sterilizing method which involves causing cavitation in a liquid substance, generating plasma in air bubbles generated by the cavitation to produce reactive oxygen species such as hydroxyl radicals (OH) in the liquid substance, and making the liquid substance free from microorganisms by oxidizability of the reactive oxygen species (see Patent Documents 1 to 3, for example).</p>

<heading id="h-0005" level="1">SUMMARY OF INVENTION</heading>
<heading id="h-0006" level="1">Technical Problem</heading>
<p id="p-0005" num="0006">The method of sterilizing a liquid substance described in Patent Documents 1 to 3 can obtain a strong sterilizing power because this method makes the liquid substance free from microorganisms by oxidizability of reactive oxygen species. However, this method has a problem that application methods and usage are restricted because it is necessary to put the liquid substance to be sterilized directly into a sterilization device.</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0007">In view of the problem of the above-described conventional method of sterilizing a liquid substance, it is an object of the present invention to provide a sterilizing liquid and a method of producing the same that have no restrictions on application methods and usage and can be widely used for sterilization.</p>
<heading id="h-0007" level="1">Solution to Problem</heading>
<p id="p-0007" num="0008">In order to achieve the above object, a sterilizing liquid of the present invention is characterized by including water containing reactive oxygen species and a nanoparticle catalyst (including secondary particles formed by aggregated nanoparticles) in a stationary state.</p>
<p id="p-0008" num="0009">In this case, the sterilizing liquid is characterized in that a concentration of hydrogen peroxide in the reactive oxygen species immediately after production of the sterilizing liquid is 30 to 2000 ppm, and a concentration of the nanoparticle catalyst is 16 ppm or more.</p>
<p id="p-0009" num="0010">Here, &#x201c;immediately after production of the sterilizing liquid&#x201d; means within a few minutes after production of the sterilizing liquid.</p>
<p id="p-0010" num="0011">Further, the sterilizing liquid is characterized in that a sterilizing effect lasts for more than a few hours.</p>
<p id="p-0011" num="0012">A method of producing a sterilizing liquid of the present invention for producing the above-described sterilizing liquid is characterized by causing cavitation in water having a conductivity of 2000 &#x3bc;S/cm or less and COD of 2000 ppm or less while causing the water to flow, and generating plasma by a plasma generation mechanism in which a pulse voltage is applied across electrodes in the water including air bubbles mainly containing water vapor generated by the cavitation, thereby producing a sterilizing liquid including water containing reactive oxygen species and a nanoparticle catalyst in a stationary state.</p>
<heading id="h-0008" level="1">Advantageous Effect of Invention</heading>
<p id="p-0012" num="0013">According to the sterilizing liquid and the method of producing the same of the present invention, it is not necessary to put a liquid substance to be sterilized directly into a sterilization device, unlike the liquid substance sterilizing method described in Patent Documents 1 to 3. In particular, the sterilizing liquid of the present invention is secure and safe because it uses water as its raw material, and the reactive oxygen species that are components exerting a sterilizing action finally turn back to water. Therefore, the present invention can provide the sterilizing liquid and the method of producing the same that have no restrictions on application methods and usage and can be widely used for sterilization.</p>

<heading id="h-0010" level="1">DESCRIPTION OF EMBODIMENTS</heading>
<p id="p-0044" num="0045">An embodiment of a sterilizing liquid and a method of producing the sterilizing liquid according to the present invention are described below.</p>
<p id="p-0045" num="0046">The sterilizing liquid of the present invention includes water containing reactive oxygen species and a nanoparticle catalyst in a stationary state. This sterilizing liquid can be produced by causing cavitation in water having a conductivity of 2000 &#x3bc;S/cm or less and COD of 2000 ppm or less while causing the water to flow, and generating plasma by a plasma generation mechanism in which a pulse voltage is applied across electrodes in the water including air bubbles mainly containing water vapor generated by the cavitation.</p>
<p id="p-0046" num="0047">A device of producing the sterilizing liquid can be a conventionally known device, that is, a mechanism of causing cavitation in water and generating plasma using a plasma generation mechanism in which a pulse voltage is applied across electrodes in the water including air bubbles mainly containing water vapor generated by the cavitation. More specifically, such a device of producing the sterilizing liquid can be a device obtained by combining a cavitation generation mechanism for causing cavitation in water by changing the flow-passage cross-sectional area with a nozzle, an obstacle, etc., and the plasma generation mechanism with each other as described in Patent Documents 1 and 2, a device obtained by combining a cavitation generation mechanism for causing cavitation in water by rotating a rotor and the plasma generation mechanism with each other as described in Patent Document 3, or the like.</p>
<p id="p-0047" num="0048">Here, an example is described which uses the device obtained by combining the cavitation generation mechanism that causes cavitation in water by rotating the rotor and the plasma generation mechanism with each other as the sterilizing liquid producing device.</p>
<p id="p-0048" num="0049">This sterilizing liquid producing device is configured to include a tank <b>1</b> that stores water therein, a stirrer <b>2</b> as a cavitation generation mechanism that stirs the water supplied from the tank <b>1</b>, a plasma generation mechanism <b>3</b> that causes cavitation by the stirrer <b>2</b> and causes generation of plasma in the water including air bubbles (cavitation bubbles) mainly containing water vapor generated by the cavitation, and a conduit line <b>4</b> that connects these mechanisms and causes the water to circulate, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0049" num="0050">Causing the water to circulate is not essential. A configuration for one-path processing may be used, as long as processing efficiency is increased more, for example, by providing a plurality of plasma generation mechanisms and/or installing a plurality of pairs of electrodes.</p>
<p id="p-0050" num="0051">The stirrer <b>2</b> is configured to include a rotor <b>22</b> that is provided in a casing <b>21</b> to be rotatable and is concentric with the casing <b>21</b>, a motor <b>23</b> that drives the rotor <b>22</b> to rotate, and the like.</p>
<p id="p-0051" num="0052">The plasma generation mechanism <b>3</b> is configured to include electrodes <b>31</b> formed by a conductor, a pulse power supply <b>32</b> that applies, for example, a voltage equal to or higher than a discharge inception voltage and a pulse voltage with a pulse width of 1.5 &#x3bc;s or less and a repetition frequency of 100 kHz or more across the electrodes <b>31</b>, and the like. By the plasma generation mechanism <b>3</b>, vapor is ionized (changed to plasma) through high voltage breakdown discharge caused by the pulse voltage in an insulating air-bubble region, whereby in-liquid plasma (cavitation plasma, which may be referred to as &#x201c;CBP (Cavitation bubble plasma)&#x201d; in the present specification) is generated.</p>
<p id="p-0052" num="0053">The form of discharge caused by the pulse voltage is preferably glow discharge (low-temperature plasma produced by glow discharge). The glow discharge can synthesize a nanoparticle catalyst in the crystal form, the quasicrystal form, the amorphous form, and the like at low temperature in an energy-efficient manner; the nanoparticle catalyst is made of, for example, an inorganic compound such as a metal or metal oxide arising from a wear component of the electrode <b>31</b>, or a sulfide or chloride arising from impurities contained in the water produced by the in-liquid plasma. That is, the nanoparticle catalyst is nanoparticles of a component of the electrode <b>31</b>. In the case where the electrodes are made of a metal, the nanoparticles are metal nanoparticles at the moment when being generated. Depending on the type of the metal, the nanoparticles are oxidized or, when chlorine or sulfur is contained in the water, chlorinated or sulfurized (the nanoparticles may be turned into a compound with a substance contained in impurities).</p>
<p id="p-0053" num="0054">The flow rate of water near the electrodes <b>31</b> in the plasma generation mechanism <b>3</b> is about 10 m/s and desirably 5 m/s or more.</p>
<p id="p-0054" num="0055">The electrodes <b>31</b> are preferably disposed to be opposed to each other in the direction perpendicular to the flow of water. However, other arrangements including the inverted V-shape arrangement can be employed, as long as plasma can be produced.</p>
<p id="p-0055" num="0056">As the material for the electrodes <b>31</b>, any of conductor materials including: metals such as tungsten, copper, iron, silver, gold, platinum, aluminum, scandium, titanium, vanadium, chromium, manganese, cobalt, nickel, zinc, gallium, germanium, yttrium, zirconium, molybdenum, technetium, ruthenium, rhodium, palladium, cadmium, indium, tin, antimony, lanthanoid, hafnium, tantalum, rhenium, osmium, iridium, thallium, bismuth, and polonium; carbon; conductive diamond; alloys of these materials; composite materials of these materials (including a member covered with a thin film formed by plating, dry coating, or the like); and oxides (including a resultant material obtained by a reaction of the surface of the electrodes <b>31</b> with water) can be selected depending on the usage. The electrodes <b>31</b> disposed to be opposed to each other can differ in the material to be used and/or the size. For example, the electrodes <b>31</b> are made of gold and silver, respectively.</p>
<p id="p-0056" num="0057">The electrodes <b>31</b> may have a shape of a cylinder, a prism, an elliptical cylinder, a cone, or a pyramid. Although one pair of electrodes <b>31</b> is enough, two or more pairs of electrodes <b>31</b> may be provided in order to increase processing efficiency more. Regarding the plasma generation mechanism, one set is enough. However, two or more sets may be provided in order to increase the processing efficiency more.</p>
<p id="p-0057" num="0058">One of the electrodes <b>31</b> may be grounded or not grounded. The configuration in which one of the electrodes <b>31</b> is not grounded is safer because a discharge path is limited between the electrodes.</p>
<p id="p-0058" num="0059">Further, water can be processed at a temperature of 50&#xb0; C. or less by operating a cooler provided in the sterilizing liquid producing device, for example, a jacket cooling unit (not shown) provided in the stirrer <b>2</b>, as necessary.</p>
<p id="p-0059" num="0060">In the water thus produced by in-liquid plasma, hydrogen peroxide or the like as reactive oxygen species is stably present, in addition to the nanoparticle catalyst, even in a stationary state in which the operation of the sterilizing liquid producing device is stopped. Therefore, this water can be used as a sterilizing liquid having a sterilizing action due to the oxidizability of hydrogen peroxide.</p>
<p id="p-0060" num="0061">This sterilizing liquid continuously produces reactive oxygen species, for example, hydroxyl radicals (&#xb7;OH) that have the highest oxidizability among the reactive oxygen species due to a sterilizing action by long-lived reactive oxygen species (superoxide anion radicals (&#xb7;O<sub>2</sub><sup>&#x2212;</sup>), hydroperoxy radicals (HOO&#xb7;), and hydrogen peroxide (H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>)) present in the sterilizing liquid and a catalyst action of the nanoparticle catalyst present in the sterilizing liquid in which hydrogen peroxide (H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>) is present, whereby the sterilizing effect is further enhanced, and the effect lasts a long time.</p>
<p id="p-0061" num="0062">Therefore, regarding the sterilizing liquid, the amounts of hydrogen peroxide and the nanoparticle catalyst that are present in the sterilizing liquid are important. According to the present invention, a large amount of sterilizing liquid can be produced only from water as a raw material in a simple, fast, and simultaneous manner.</p>
<p id="p-0062" num="0063"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref> shows the principle of decomposing (killing) organic matter (including microorganisms (e.g., viruses, bacteria, fungi, and protozoa) by reactive oxygen species, and an oxidation potential and a binding energy for various materials including the reactive oxygen species.</p>
<p id="p-0063" num="0064">As is apparent from <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref>, the reactive oxygen species such as hydroxyl radicals (&#xb7;OH) have a strong action of decomposing (killing) organic matter (including microorganisms (e.g., viruses, bacteria, fungi, and protozoa), and therefore can be used as a sterilizing liquid.</p>

<p id="p-0067" num="0067">As for Table 1 and <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref>, the following can be said.
<ul id="ul0002" list-style="none">
    <li id="ul0002-0001" num="0000">
    <ul id="ul0003" list-style="none">
        <li id="ul0003-0001" num="0068">As an initial conductivity is lower, a plasma production rate (a ratio of the number of pulses produced by plasma to the number of applied pulses) is higher, and therefore reactive oxygen sterilizing water can be efficiently produced. Here, &#x201c;initial means &#x201c;before plasma processing&#x201d;. This is the same as to other items.</li>
        <li id="ul0003-0002" num="0069">Higher initial COD is not preferable because produced reactive oxygen species are consumed.</li>
        <li id="ul0003-0003" num="0070">Other contaminants have no effect as long as the initial conductivity, an initial PH value, and the initial COD are within preferable ranges, respectively. Therefore, it is preferable to use purified water such as ion-exchanged water as water that is a raw material of processing. However, the raw material is not limited thereto.</li>
        <li id="ul0003-0004" num="0071">As the number of revolutions of a stirrer becomes larger, cavitation bubbles increase. Therefore, the plasma production rate becomes high, and reactive oxygen sterilizing water can be efficiently produced.</li>
        <li id="ul0003-0005" num="0072">When an applied voltage is excessively low, plasma is not lit up. When the applied voltage is high, the plasma production rate becomes high. However, an excessively high applied voltage is not preferable because transition from glow discharge, which is preferable, to arc discharge occurs.</li>
        <li id="ul0003-0006" num="0073">Plasma is not lit up when the pulse width is excessively short, whereas the plasma production rate becomes high when the pulse width is long. However, an excessively long pulse width is not preferable because transition to arc discharge occurs.</li>
        <li id="ul0003-0007" num="0074">As a repetition frequency is higher, the plasma production rate is higher, and plasma can be produced more stably.</li>
        <li id="ul0003-0008" num="0075">A pulse voltage may be bipolar or have a positive polarity or a negative polarity.</li>
        <li id="ul0003-0009" num="0076">It suffices that the electrode material is any conductor, as long as it is stable in water. The electrode material may be a metal, an alloy, or carbon.</li>
        <li id="ul0003-0010" num="0077">Since a nanoparticle catalyst such as an electrode component is mixed as impurities in the reactive oxygen sterilizing water, the electrode material needs to be selected depending on usage.</li>
        <li id="ul0003-0011" num="0078">When the electrode diameter is excessively thin, concentration of an electric field occurs, and plasma can be lit up easily. However, transition to arc discharge can occur easily. When the electrode diameter is excessively thick, plasma is less likely to be lit up.</li>
        <li id="ul0003-0012" num="0079">When the gap length between the electrodes is excessively short, transition to arc discharge can easily occur. When this gap length is excessively long, plasma is less likely to be lit up.</li>
        <li id="ul0003-0013" num="0080">When the processing time is excessively short, the produced amounts of reactive oxygen species and nanoparticle catalyst are reduced. When the processing time is excessively long, the reactive oxygen species and the nanoparticle catalyst that are produced make the conductivity higher and the plasma generation rate lower. The processing time is normally about 2 to 10 minutes, preferably about 3 to 8 minutes, and more preferably about 5 minutes. Here, the sterilizing liquid producing device is set in such a manner that, when the number of revolutions of the stirrer is 7200 rpm, 250 mL of water circulates in the device once per second.</li>

<heading id="h-0016" level="2">(3) Preparation of Test Bacteria Solution</heading>
<p id="p-0071" num="0084">The test bacteria were cultured on a nutrient agar medium (manufactured by Eiken Chemical Co., Ltd.) at 35&#xb0; C.&#xb1;1&#xb0; C. for 18 to 24 hours, then suspended in purified water, and adjusted to set the number of bacteria to about 107 mL.

<heading id="h-0017" level="2">(4) Pre-Processing for Sterilizing Liquid Producing Device</heading>
<p id="p-0072" num="0085">A sodium hypochlorite solution prepared to have a concentration of about 0.02% was put into the sterilizing liquid producing device, and the device was operated for 15 minutes under a condition without plasma processing. After drainage, the inside of the sterilizing liquid producing device was rinsed with tap water, tap water containing 0.002% sodium thiosulfate, and distilled water in this order, followed by drainage.</p>
<heading id="h-0018" level="2">(5) Test Operation</heading>
<p id="p-0073" num="0086">Into the sterilizing liquid producing device after pre-processing, 250 mL of purified water (ion-exchanged water) was put. The device was then operated for 5 minutes under a processing condition shown in Table 2. Sample water was thus obtained. The sample water was collected in a sterile container made of synthetic resin and left to stand for a predetermined time. Then, 0.1 mL of the test bacteria solution was inoculated into 10 mL of the sample water after standing for the predetermined time, to obtain a test solution. Thereafter, the test solution was diluted 100 times with an SCDLP medium (manufactured by Nihon Pharmaceutical Co., Ltd.), and the number of viable bacteria in the test solution was measured using a medium for measuring the number of bacteria.</p>
<p id="p-0074" num="0087">As a control, purified water (ion-exchanged water) with the test bacteria solution inoculated thereto was also tested in the same manner, and the number of viable bacteria in the test solution was measured using the medium for measuring the number of bacteria.</p>

<p id="p-0079" num="0093">The reason why the aqueous solution of organic matter (methylene blue) was used in place of microorganisms is that a factor of a sterilizing effect and a factor of an effect of decomposing of the organic matter (methylene blue) are both reactive oxygen species, and therefore methylene blue, which can be evaluated more easily, is used (the same applies to a sterilizing effect test (2) described later).</p>

<p id="p-0083" num="0095">First, a test was conducted in order to confirm that an organic matter decomposition effect may be greatly affected by residues such as organic matter in the sterilizing liquid producing device.</p>
<p id="p-0084" num="0096"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b></figref> shows change of an absorption peak value of an MB solution processed under the condition of Table 3 (t<sub>p</sub>=5 min, t<sub>e</sub>=0 to 10 min) with time (a relation between elapsed time and the absorption peak value). Here, explanatory notes [A, B, C, and D] respectively represent that pre-processing was performed under conditions of [Table 3 (t<sub>p</sub>=0 min), Table 3 (t<sub>p</sub>=5 min), Table 4 (t<sub>p</sub>=5 min), and Table 4 (t<sub>p</sub>=10 min)] immediately before the processing.</p>
<p id="p-0085" num="0097">The change with time was greatly different depending on the pre-processing immediately before the processing. In particular, an MB decomposition speed was greatly reduced after the MB solution was put before the processing. Thus, it was confirmed that the organic matter decomposition effect was greatly affected by residues (contamination) such as organic matter in the sterilizing liquid producing device.</p>
<p id="p-0086" num="0098">Further, based on the above findings, the inside of the CBP device was washed five times with ion-exchanged water before the test, and glass cells, glass beakers, and a processed liquid discharge port of the CBP device were subjected to ultrasonic cleaning with ion-exchanged water for 5 minutes, whereby contaminants were removed.</p>
<p id="p-0087" num="0099">In addition, a container (a quartz glass cell (for an ultraviolet-visible absorption spectrum) or a beaker (container)) from which a sterilizing liquid is taken out is also cleaned. It is desirable that a container for storing the sterilizing liquid therein be non-organic and uncontaminated.</p>
<p id="p-0088" num="0100">Therefore, in the following test, Table 4 (t<sub>p</sub>=5 min) was set as a standard condition, and a method including the above-described pre-processing was adopted.</p>

<p id="p-0090" num="0102">These show that OH radicals and O radicals are produced in plasma-processed water processed under the processing condition for the sterilizing liquid producing device.</p>
<p id="p-0091" num="0103">Next, an organic matter decomposition effect test was conducted in the following procedure.</p>

<p id="p-0094" num="0106">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>8</b></figref>, when t<sub>p</sub>=0.1 min, the absorption peak value hardly decreases as the elapsed time increases.</p>
<p id="p-0095" num="0107">Meanwhile, when t<sub>p</sub>=2 min, the absorption peak value decreases exponentially in a range of t<sub>e</sub>=2 to 20 min with increase in the elapsed time. After t<sub>e</sub>=20 min, the slope becomes gentle. At t<sub>e</sub>=30 min, the absorption peak value decreases to 1.8. The decreased speed is the maximum at t<sub>p</sub>=5 min, and decreases to 1.4 when the absorption peak value t<sub>e </sub>is 30 min. After t<sub>p</sub>=5 min, the decrease speed becomes smaller, and when t<sub>p</sub>=20 min, the absorption peak value decreases only up to 1.82. From these results, it can be said that the decomposition effect remains more in the plasma-processed water in the case of t<sub>p</sub>=5 min.</p>
<p id="p-0096" num="0108">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>9</b></figref>, in a range of t<sub>p</sub>=2 to 5 min, the reaction speed constant k linearly increases with increase in the CBP processing time, and k=0.012 min<sup>&#x2212;1 </sup>when t<sub>p</sub>=5 min.

Thereafter, the decrease speed becomes gentle, and k=0.0030 min<sup>&#x2212;1 </sup>when t<sub>p</sub>=20 min. These results show that the CBP processing time providing the strongest residual decomposition effect is around t<sub>p</sub>=5 min (a concentration of hydrogen peroxide among reactive oxygen species=1500 ppm (see <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>10</b></figref>)), and the CBP processing time providing the residual decomposition effect is about 2 to 10 minutes (the concentration of hydrogen peroxide among reactive oxygen species=700 to 2000 ppm (see <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>10</b></figref>)) and is preferably about 3 to 8 minutes (the concentration of hydrogen peroxide among reactive oxygen species=1000 to 1800 ppm (see <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>10</b></figref>)).</p>

When t<sub>p</sub>=10 min, the amount of electrode wear becomes 18 mg (the concentration of nanoparticle catalyst=72 ppm). These results show that the concentration of nanoparticle catalyst contained in a sterilizing liquid is equal to or higher than 16 ppm (to 72 ppm). The reason why an electrode is worn as the CBP processing time increases is that the electrode becomes nanoparticles due to sputtering by CBP processing.</p>

<p id="p-0112" num="0125">In the following test, Table 6 (t<sub>p</sub>=5 min) was set as a standard condition, and a method including the same pre-processing as that in the sterilizing effect test (1) was adopted.</p>
<p id="p-0113" num="0126">Next, an organic matter decomposition effect test was conducted in the following procedure.</p>
<p id="p-0114" num="0127">Immediately after processing under the processing condition for a sterilizing liquid producing device shown in Table 6, 260 &#x3bc;L of an MB solution having a concentration of 8600 ppm was put into the device, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>15</b></figref>. Change of a peak intensity at a wavelength of 664 nm in an ultraviolet-visible absorption spectrum of the MB solution after the MB solution was put with time (t<sub>e</sub>=0.03 to 15 h (hours)) was measured using an ultraviolet-visible spectrophotometer (V-730BIO, JASCO Corporation), and an MB decomposition rate for each elapsed time after production of a sterilizing liquid was calculated.</p>

<p id="p-0116" num="0129">From <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>16</b></figref>, it is found that an MB decomposition effect at t<sub>e</sub>=15 h is higher as processing time is longer. However, in a region of t<sub>e</sub>&#x3c;2 h, the best MB decomposition rate is obtained when t<sub>p</sub>=3 min. This suggests that the dominant factor of the MB decomposition effect is different before and after t<sub>e</sub>=2 h. Although the factors of MB decomposition will be described below, it was confirmed that a sterilizing effect of a sterilizing liquid lasts for more than a few hours (15 hours or more from the test result in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>16</b></figref> or dozens of hours or more from the test results in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>22</b> to <b>26</b></figref> described later) due to involvement of reactive oxygen species present at the time of production of the sterilizing liquid in a region of t<sub>e</sub>&#x3c;2 h or involvement of the above reactive oxygen species and OH radicals produced by dissociation of hydrogen peroxide contained in the sterilizing liquid in a region of t<sub>e</sub>&#x3e;2 h. Here, a storage temperature of the produced sterilizing liquid is 25&#xb0; C. The sterilizing effect of the sterilizing liquid can be maintained by storing the sterilizing liquid at room temperature (normal temperature without cooling or heating). Since a reaction speed of a dissociation reaction of hydrogen peroxide described above decreases as the storage temperature is lower similarly to a normal chemical reaction, it is considered that the duration of the sterilizing effect of the sterilizing liquid can be extended by maintaining the storage temperature low.</p>
<p id="p-0117" num="0130">That is, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>17</b></figref>, reactive oxygen species (&#xb7;OH, &#xb7;O, &#xb7;HO<sub>2</sub>, &#xb7;O<sub>2</sub><sup>&#x2212;</sup>, O<sub>3</sub>) (it is considered that OH radicals and O radicals are produced in plasma-processed water processed under a processing condition for a sterilizing liquid producing device as described with reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>6</b> and <b>7</b></figref>, and those radicals react with water to produce reactive oxygen species), hydrogen peroxide (H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>), and tungsten (W) nanoparticles (nanoparticle catalyst) are present in a sterilizing liquid (CBPTW) that is CBP-processed water.</p>
<p id="p-0118" num="0131">Here, it is considered that hydrogen peroxide (H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>) is produced by performing CBP processing for water, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>18</b></figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0119" num="0132">Further, a part of tungsten (W) nanoparticles (a nanoparticle catalyst) is present as tungsten (W) ions under the presence of hydrogen peroxide (H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>), as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>19</b></figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0120" num="0133">Furthermore, by an action of the tungsten (W) nanoparticles (the nanoparticle catalyst) and the tungsten (W) ions, hydrogen peroxide (H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>) dissociates to produce hydroxyl radicals (&#xb7;OH) that are OH radicals, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>20</b></figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0121" num="0134">Consequently, a sterilizing effect of a sterilizing liquid lasts a long time (specifically, more than a few hours (16 hours or more from the test result in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>16</b></figref> or dozens of hours or more from the test results in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>22</b> to <b>26</b></figref> described later)) due to involvement of reactive oxygen species present at the time of production of the sterilizing liquid in an initial stage or involvement of these reactive oxygen species and OH radicals produced by dissociation of hydrogen peroxide contained in the sterilizing liquid after a certain period of time has elapsed after production of the sterilizing liquid.</p>
<p id="p-0122" num="0135">Here, it is apparent from the result of a comparative test for a sterilizing liquid that is CBP-processed water (CBPTW) and a hydrogen peroxide solution, shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>21</b></figref>, that the tungsten (W) nanoparticles (a nanoparticle catalyst) contribute to decomposition of organic matter (methylene blue) (sterilization) by causing hydrogen peroxide contained in the sterilizing liquid to dissociate and produce hydroxyl radicals (&#xb7;OH) (this effect cannot be obtained by hydrogen peroxide alone).</p>
<p id="p-0123" num="0136">A relation between a processing condition for a sterilizing liquid producing device in the sterilizing effect test (2), the amount of electrode wear, and the water quality (with no MB solution added) is described here, with reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>22</b> to <b>26</b></figref>.</p>

<p id="p-0125" num="0138">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>22</b></figref>, the tungsten (W) electrode is worn about 1.8 mg at t<sub>p</sub>=1 min. The amount of wear then increases linearly in a range of t<sub>p</sub>=1 to 10 min, and reaches about 17.3 mg at t<sub>p</sub>=10 min. Thereafter, the slope of the increase becomes gentle, and the amount of wear is about 32.5 mg at t<sub>p</sub>=30 min. It is considered that the slope becomes gentler with increase in the processing time because a conductivity of a solution increases and a plasma generation rate decreases. The worn electrode is present as tungsten (W) nanoparticles or tungsten (W) ions in a sterilizing liquid that is CBP-processed water (CBPTW). From this, the concentration of a nanoparticle catalyst contained in the sterilizing liquid is 130 ppm at t<sub>p</sub>=30 min. Further, considering that the nanoparticle catalyst contributes to dissociation of hydrogen peroxide (H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>) (production of hydroxyl radicals (&#xb7;OH)), it can be said that when the sterilizing liquid is used a few hours after production of the sterilizing liquid, the concentration of the nanoparticle catalyst is preferably 70 ppm or more (t<sub>p</sub>=10 min or more) and more preferably 130 ppm or more (t<sub>p</sub>=30 min or more).</p>
<p id="p-0126" num="0139"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>23</b></figref> shows a relation between elapsed time after production of a sterilizing liquid and a pH value for each processing condition (t<sub>p</sub>=1 min to 30 min) for a sterilizing liquid producing device.</p>

It is found that the pH value decreases with increase in the plasma processing time, but is substantially constant at any elapsed time after processing except for the case of t<sub>p</sub>=30 min. In the case of t<sub>p</sub>=30 min, the pH value is 3.3 at t<sub>e</sub>=0.03 h, then increases until t<sub>e</sub>=1 h, and thereafter is substantially constant to be 3.6.

<p id="p-0129" num="0142">When t<sub>p</sub>=1 min, the conductivity is about 16 &#x3bc;S/cm at t<sub>e</sub>=0.1 h, increases until t<sub>e</sub>=1.5 h, and tends to be saturated after reaching about 18.5 &#x3bc;S/cm. Thereafter, the conductivity decreases little by little and is about 18.3 &#x3bc;S/cm at t<sub>e</sub>=24 h. When t<sub>p</sub>=5 min or less, change of the conductivity with time has the same tendency as that when t<sub>p</sub>=1 min. However, when t<sub>p</sub>=7 min, the conductivity decreases as the elapsed time after processing increases. When t<sub>p</sub>=30 min, the decrease is particularly remarkable. The conductivity rapidly decreases until t<sub>e</sub>=1 h, that is, the conductivity that is 200 &#x3bc;S/cm at t<sub>e</sub>=0.1 h decreases to 140 &#x3bc;S/cm at t<sub>e</sub>=1 h. Thereafter, the conductivity tends to be saturated and is 138 &#x3bc;S/cm at t<sub>e</sub>=24 h. The cause of the decrease in conductivity is considered to be that W dissolves in water having a high hydrogen peroxide concentration. It is considered that W is precipitated in the CBP-processed water to cause decrease of W ions in a solution and to lower the conductivity.</p>

<p id="p-0131" num="0144">When t<sub>p</sub>=1 min, the ORP is about 588 mV at t<sub>e</sub>=0.1 h, increases little by little with increase in elapsed time after processing, and increases to about 592 mV at t<sub>e</sub>=24 h. Further, when t<sub>p</sub>=7 min or less, the ORP increases little by little with increase in the elapsed time after processing, as with the tendency when t<sub>p</sub>=1 min. However, when t<sub>p</sub>=10 min or more, the ORP decreases with increase in the elapsed time after processing. It is considered that hydrogen peroxide is involved in this tendency. Hydrogen peroxide is decomposed into OH radicals by being added to metal powder. OH radicals are an oxidant and are involved in the increase in the ORP. From this, it is considered that the ORP value is increased by decomposition of hydrogen peroxide. Therefore, it is considered that the ORP decreased due to decrease in hydrogen peroxide and decrease in produced OH radicals.</p>

<p id="p-0133" num="0146">Hydrogen peroxide is produced by a reaction of water during plasma production. When t<sub>p</sub>=1 min, the hydrogen peroxide concentration is about 360 ppm at t<sub>e</sub>=0.03 h, decreases exponentially with increase in elapsed time after processing, and is about 60 ppm at t<sub>e</sub>=24 h. Although the hydrogen peroxide concentration decreased exponentially with regard to all processing times, the same level of hydrogen peroxide concentration was shown at t<sub>e</sub>=0.03 h (about 30 ppm when t<sub>p</sub>=30 min). When t<sub>p</sub>=5, 7, and 10 min, the hydrogen peroxide concentration at t<sub>e</sub>=30 h became lower as the processing time was longer. It is known that hydrogen peroxide dissociates into OH radicals in an environment of metal ions. As for the hydrogen peroxide concentration, it is considered that due to the above factors, a dissociation speed increases as the processing time increases. However, considering the relation between the elapsed time after production of a sterilizing liquid and the MB decomposition rate for each processing condition (t<sub>p</sub>=1 min to 30 min) for a sterilizing liquid producing device shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>16</b></figref>, it was found that the CBP processing time providing the sterilizing effect is not limited to t<sub>p</sub>=about 2 to 10 minutes derived from the result of the sterilizing effect test (1), and the sterilizing effect is exerted also at t<sub>p</sub>=30 minutes (the concentration of hydrogen peroxide in reactive oxygen species=30 ppm (see <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>26</b></figref>) (or more).</p>
<p id="p-0134" num="0147">From the experimental results shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>22</b> to <b>26</b></figref>, it is considered that hydrogen peroxide is involved in decomposition of MB. It is considered that reactive oxygen species, hydrogen peroxide, and nanoparticles and ions of a metal are present in a sterilizing liquid that is CBP-processed water (CBPTW), and OH radicals produced by dissociation of hydrogen peroxide occurring under an environment of the metal ions are a factor of making a decomposition effect last. In addition, since the amount of electrode wear increases with increase in the processing time, it is considered that the metal nanoparticles and ions in a solution increase with increase in the processing time. Therefore, it is considered that the dissociation speed of hydrogen peroxide increases with increase in the processing time. When t<sub>e</sub>&#x3c;2 h, it is considered that the decomposition effect is further enhanced by relatively long-lived reactive oxygen species directly produced by CBP in addition to the above. Further, since the plasma generation rate decreases with increase in the processing time, it is considered that, as the processing time increases, the reactive oxygen species produced by CBP reach a maximum value and then decrease. Therefore, it is considered that before t<sub>e</sub>&#x3c;2 h, the decomposition effect was the maximum at 3 min, and thereafter increased in descending order of the processing time.</p>

<p id="p-0136" num="0149">The in-liquid plasma (cavitation plasma) is produced by application of high-repetition and high-voltage pulses.</p>
<p id="p-0137" num="0150">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>27</b></figref>, the plasma generation rate tends to decrease after the CBP processing time t<sub>p</sub>=3 to 5 min.</p>
<p id="p-0138" num="0151">The reason for this is considered to be that a conductivity of processed water increases as CBP processing proceeds, a voltage applied across electrodes decreases in relation to the output impedance of a power supply, the probability that the applied voltage falls below a discharge inception voltage increases, and the number of times that plasma is not produced increases.</p>
<p id="p-0139" num="0152">As described above, when the plasma generation rate decreases, reactive oxygen species present in an initial stage decrease. Therefore, in the case of using a sterilizing liquid within 2 hours after production of the sterilizing liquid, a preferable CBP processing time is t<sub>p</sub>=about 5 min.</p>
<p id="p-0140" num="0153">Next, a relation between an electrode material, a sterilizing effect, the amount of electrode wear, and the water quality (with no MB solution added) as for a sterilizing liquid (CBPTW) produced under the processing condition (Table 6 (t<sub>p</sub>=5 min)) for a sterilizing liquid producing device in the sterilizing effect test (2), using W, Fe, Cu, and Ag as the electrode material, is described with reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>28</b> to <b>31</b></figref>.</p>

<p id="p-0142" num="0155">In the case of a W electrode, the decomposition rate exponentially increases to 20% when elapsed time after processing t<sub>e</sub>=0.03 to 3 h. Thereafter, the slope becomes gentle, and the decomposition rate increases to 58% at t<sub>e</sub>=30 h. In the case where CBPTW was prepared with other electrodes and MB was added, the decomposition rate rapidly increased at t<sub>e</sub>=0.1 to 3 h, and then showed a saturation tendency as with the W electrode. However, in the case of Cu and Fe electrodes, the decomposition rate at t<sub>e</sub>=30 h increased to about 100%. In the case of the Cu and Fe electrodes, a manner of increase of the decomposition rate was also different. At t<sub>e</sub>=3 h, the decomposition rate for the Cu electrode increased by about 76%, whereas the decomposition rate for the Fe electrode increased by only about 65%. These results show that an effect of decomposing MB is higher in the case where the electrode material is Cu than in the case where the electrode material is Fe. In the case where the electrode material is Ag, the decomposition rate at t<sub>e</sub>=30 h is about 10%, i.e., almost no decomposition occurs. These results show that the MB decomposition effect is higher in the order of Ag&#x3c;W&#x3c;Fe&#x3c;Cu as the electrode material.</p>

For Fe, Cu and Ag electrodes, the pH values are about 5.2, 5.8, 7.2 at t<sub>e</sub>=0.1 h, respectively. In addition, in the case of the Fe electrode, the pH value increases gradually as the elapsed time increases, and is about 5.5 at t<sub>e</sub>=970 h.

In the case of Fe, Cu and Ag electrodes, the conductivities were lower than that of the W electrode and were only about 8 &#x3bc;S/cm. The conductivities of the Fe, Cu and Ag electrodes increased gradually with increase in the elapsed time, and were about 9, 15, and 11 &#x3bc;S/cm at t<sub>e</sub>=950 h, respectively.

At t<sub>e</sub>=0.03 h, the hydrogen peroxide concentrations for Fe and Cu electrodes are about 1200 ppm, similar to the W electrode. However, the hydrogen peroxide concentration is out of a measurement range at t<sub>e</sub>=400 h for the Fe electrode or at t<sub>e</sub>=48 h for the Cu electrode. From these results, it is found that the decrease amount of the hydrogen peroxide concentration varies depending on the electrode material. Further, for an Ag electrode, the hydrogen peroxide concentration is 10 ppm at t<sub>e</sub>=0.03 h, and is out of a measurement range at t<sub>e</sub>=4 h. Therefore, it is found that the hydrogen peroxide concentration decreases more largely as compared with the other electrodes.
