<p id="p-0001" num="0000">An expandable bowl has an open top and a plurality of configuration changing side members connecting the open top to a base member. The configuration changing side members are designed to allow a user to pull the base member to changing the side members from a collapsed configuration to an expanded configuration, thereby increasing the overall volume of the bowl. The expandable bowl may be useful for various products, such as pre-packaged salads, where the salads may be packaged and displayed in the collapsed configuration, thereby minimizing shelf space, and may be changed to the expanded configuration by a user to permit tossing of the salad without risking spillage of the contents of the bowl.</p>

<p id="p-0002" num="0001">This application is a continuation-in-part of U.S. Pat. application number 15/945,585, filed Apr. 4, 2018, the contents of which are herein incorporated by reference.</p>
<?cross-reference-to-related-applications description="Cross Reference To Related Applications" end="tail"?>
<?summary-of-invention description="Summary of Invention" end="lead"?>
<heading level="1" id="h-0002">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<heading level="1" id="h-0003">1. Field of the Invention</heading>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">One or more embodiments of the invention relates generally to containers. More particularly, the invention relates to an expandable container useful for containing food products, such as salads, pre-packaged for a consumer.</p>
<heading level="1" id="h-0004">2. Description of Prior Art and Related Information</heading>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">The following background information may present examples of specific aspects of the prior art (e.g., without limitation, approaches, facts, or common wisdom) that, while expected to be helpful to further educate the reader as to additional aspects of the prior art, is not to be construed as limiting the present invention, or any embodiments thereof, to anything stated or implied therein or inferred thereupon.</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">Salads from food service establishments, primarily quick-service restaurants, grocery stores, grab &amp; go food stands such as at the airport, or the like, are typically sold in plastic containers that typically look like salad bowls with a lid. Often times, the salad and its toppings are packed to the top of the container in order to use all available container space, with the lid possibly stabilizing the entire salad contents.</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">However, there are problems with this existing arrangement. First, since it is difficult and time consuming to achieve a uniform dispersion of salad dressing on the entire salad within that same container, when a customer pours on the salad dressing, they have no choice but to put it on only the top of the salad, thereby getting too much on some parts and not enough on others. Second, often times, customers use more salad dressing than they need because of this problem. Third, when the customer does attempt to toss the salad, they must either empty the contents into a larger bowl and use utensils to toss, or attempt tossing it in the existing container, thereby losing product and creating a mess. Fourth, when the salad is not tossed, customers often eat the salad toppings because that is what is most accessible and leave the lettuce at the bottom of the bowl. This can significantly defeat the intended texture and experience of the salad, especially when the salads were intended to be tossed (for example, a Caesar salad and the like).</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">Customers often justify paying two to three times the amount of money for a similar tossed salad, primarily due to the ease of consuming and an intended experience of consuming the pre-tossed salad is greater. Many quick service restaurants often therefore price similar but un-tossed salads lower than the pre-tossed counterparts, because of the real or imagined compromise in their product and not giving the customer the anticipated perceived salad consuming experience and value. Further, when a salad is tossed, different people desire different amounts of salad dressing, dictated by many factors including taste, diet, and the like.</p>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">In view of the foregoing, there is a need for a salad bowl that can be packaged in a full, stabilized state, but also provide the consumer with the ability to toss the salad within the bowl without creating a mess.</p>
<heading level="1" id="h-0005">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0009" num="0008">Embodiments of the present invention provide an expandable bowl assembly comprising a bowl; a lid operable to cover a top opening of the bowl; one or more configuration transition side members extending from the top opening toward a base of the bowl, each of the one or more configuration transition side members formed as a ring-shaped member having an inner surface defining a portion of an interior of the bowl; and one or more non-transforming side members disposed between the top opening and the one or more configuration transition side members, each of the one or more non-transforming side members formed as a ring-shaped member having an inner surface defining another portion of the interior of the bowl, wherein the base is movable between an expanded configuration, where at least one of the one or more configuration transition side members are angled inward and downward toward the base of the bowl, and a collapsed configuration, where each of the one or more configuration transition side members are angled inward and upward toward the top opening of the bowl, where an interior volume of the bowl in the expanded configuration is greater than the interior volume of the bowl in the collapsed configuration.</p>
<p id="p-0010" num="0009">Embodiments of the present invention further provide a prepackaged salad comprising an undressed salad disposed inside an expandable bowl assembly configured in a collapsed configuration, the expandable bowl assembly including a bowl; a lid operable to cover a top opening of the bowl; one or more configuration transition side members extending from the top opening toward a base of the bowl, each of the one or more configuration transition side members formed as a ring-shaped member having an inner surface defining a portion of an interior of the bowl; and one or more non-transforming side members disposed between the top opening and the one or more configuration transition side members, each of the one or more non-transforming side members formed as a ring-shaped member having an inner surface defining another portion of the interior of the bowl, wherein the base is movable between an expanded configuration, where at least one of the one or more configuration transition side members are angled inward and downward toward the base of the bowl, and the collapsed configuration, where each of the one or more configuration transition side members are angled inward and upward toward the top opening of the bowl, where an interior volume of the bowl in the expanded configuration is greater than the interior volume of the bowl in the collapsed configuration.</p>
<p id="p-0011" num="0010">Embodiments of the present invention also provide a method for selling and consuming a prepackaged salad comprising filling an expandable bowl of an expandable bowl assembly, in its collapsed configuration, with salad; placing a lid on the expandable bowl; displaying the prepackaged salad for a consumer; expanding the expandable bowl into an expanded configuration; placing salad dressing on the salad; and mixing the salad dressing with the salad inside the expandable bowl in the expanded configuration, wherein the expandable bowl includes one or more configuration transition side members extending from the top opening toward a base of the expandable bowl, each of the one or more configuration transition side members formed as a ring-shaped member having an inner surface defining a portion of an interior of the expandable bowl, and one or more non-transforming side members disposed between the top opening and the one or more configuration transition side members, each of the one or more non-transforming side members formed as a ring-shaped member having an inner surface defining another portion of the interior of the expandable bowl, wherein the base is movable between the expanded configuration, where at least one of the one or more configuration transition side members are angled inward and downward toward the base of the bowl, and the collapsed configuration, where each of the one or more configuration transition side members are angled inward and upward toward the top opening of the expandable bowl, where an interior volume of the expandable bowl in the expanded configuration is greater than the interior volume of the expandable bowl in the collapsed configuration.</p>

<p id="p-0039" num="0038">Unless otherwise defined, all terms (including technical and scientific terms) used herein have the same meaning as commonly understood by one having ordinary skill in the art to which this invention belongs. It will be further understood that terms, such as those defined in commonly used dictionaries, should be interpreted as having a meaning that is consistent with their meaning in the context of the relevant art and the present disclosure and will not be interpreted in an idealized or overly formal sense unless expressly so defined herein.</p>
<p id="p-0040" num="0039">In describing the invention, it will be understood that a number of techniques and steps are disclosed. Each of these has individual benefit and each can also be used in conjunction with one or more, or in some cases all, of the other disclosed techniques. Accordingly, for the sake of clarity, this description will refrain from repeating every possible combination of the individual steps in an unnecessary fashion. Nevertheless, the specification and claims should be read with the understanding that such combinations are entirely within the scope of the invention and the claims.</p>
<p id="p-0041" num="0040">The present disclosure is to be considered as an exemplification of the invention, and is not intended to limit the invention to the specific embodiments illustrated by the figures or description below.</p>
<p id="p-0042" num="0041">As is well known to those skilled in the art, many careful considerations and compromises typically must be made when designing for the optimal configuration of a commercial implementation of any system, and in particular, the embodiments of the present invention. A commercial implementation in accordance with the spirit and teachings of the present invention may be configured according to the needs of the particular application, whereby any aspect(s), feature(s), function(s), result(s), component(s), approach(es), or step(s) of the teachings related to any described embodiment of the present invention may be suitably omitted, included, adapted, mixed and matched, or improved and/or optimized by those skilled in the art, using their average skills and known techniques, to achieve the desired implementation that addresses the needs of the particular application.</p>
<p id="p-0043" num="0042">Broadly, embodiments of the present invention provide an expandable bowl having an open top and a plurality of configuration changing side members connecting the open top to a base member. The configuration changing side members are designed to allow a user to squeeze, pull, or generally adjust the base member to change the side members from a collapsed configuration to an expanded configuration, thereby increasing the overall volume of the bowl. The expandable bowl may be useful for various products, such as pre-packaged salads, where the salads may be packaged and displayed in the collapsed configuration, thereby minimizing shelf space and being easily portable by a consumer, fitting into backpacks, purses, briefcases, or the like. Moreover, because the ingredients can be packed to the top in the collapsed configuration, the salad ingredients do not move in the bowl, under the lid, so the salad still looks presentable when eaten. The expandable bowl may be changed to the expanded configuration by a user to permit tossing of the salad without risking spillage of the contents of the bowl. Even if the consumer chooses not to toss the salad, the salad is easier to eat than other salad bowls as 1) the ingredients settle, and 2) the consumer can use their non-eating hand to hold the bowl from underneath, using the same round bottom previously used to expand the bowl as a grip/handle. This makes salad eating more mobile, which is also an important advantage with the expandable bowl of the present invention.</p>
<p id="p-0044" num="0043">In some embodiments, the bowl can include a depression from the bottom and protruding into a base of the bowl, where a user may be able to, for example, spin the bowl on one&#x2019;s finger via the depression.</p>
<p id="p-0045" num="0044">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>1</b> through <b>6</b></figref>, an expandable bowl assembly <b>10</b>, or simply bowl assembly <b>10</b>, can include an expandable bowl <b>12</b>, or simply bowl <b>12</b>, and a lid <b>14</b> fitting over an open end of the bowl <b>12</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0046" num="0045">The bowl <b>12</b> can be formed from a plurality of configuration transition side members <b>16</b> that can permit the bowl <b>12</b> to change between an expanded configuration, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b>A</figref> and a collapsed configuration, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b>B</figref>. In some embodiments, the side members <b>16</b> can include a plurality of notched regions <b>18</b>. The notched regions <b>18</b> may be disposed equidistantly about the side members <b>16</b>. The notched regions <b>18</b> may include an indent shaped generally in an inverted V-shape, where a width of each of the notched regions <b>18</b> is greater proximate to the open end of the bowl <b>12</b>. The configuration transition side members <b>16</b> are generally ring-shaped members with an inside surface forming a portion of an interior of the bowl <b>12</b>. As used herein, the term &#x201c;ring-shaped member&#x201d; describes a member that forms a loop. The shape of the ring-shaped members may be round rings, triangular rings, square rings, oval rings, rectangular rings, or the like.</p>
<p id="p-0047" num="0046">Non-transforming side members <b>19</b> may be disposed between the configuration transition side members <b>16</b>. In some embodiments, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b></figref>, the non-transforming side member <b>19</b> may be disposed between a lid opening and a first configuration transition side member <b>16</b>. A second non-transforming side member <b>19</b> may be disposed between the first configuration transition side member <b>16</b> and a second configuration transition side member <b>16</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0048" num="0047">The configuration transition side members <b>16</b> and the non-transforming side members <b>19</b> may be disposed as alternating ring-like members having decreasing diameters from the lid region toward the bottom <b>20</b> of the bowl <b>12</b>. While two configuration transition side members <b>16</b> are shown, additional configuration transition side members <b>16</b> may be added to create a deeper bowl and a greater difference in bowl volumes between the expanded and collapsed configurations.</p>
<p id="p-0049" num="0048">The configuration transition side members <b>16</b> may be angled downward, from a surface parallel with the base <b>20</b>, from about 10 to about 50 degrees, when the bowl <b>12</b> is in the expanded configuration, thus creating a bowl-shaped bowl. The configuration transition side members <b>16</b> may be angled upward from a line parallel to the bottom <b>20</b>, or simply angled upward, from 1 to 30 degrees, for example, in the collapsed configuration. The non-transforming side members <b>19</b> may remain angled downward regardless of configuration. Typically, the non-transforming side members <b>19</b> are angled downward, from a surface parallel with the base <b>20</b>, at angle from about 40 to about 90 degrees. Typically, the downward angle of the non-transforming side members <b>19</b> is greater than the downward angle of the configuration transition side members <b>16</b> in the expanded configuration. Thus, in the collapsed configuration, the bottom <b>20</b> of the bowl can nest within the bowl <b>12</b>. Typically, by transforming the bowl <b>12</b> from the collapsed configuration to the expanded configuration will result in a volume increase from about 120% to over 200%, typically from about 130% to about 180%.</p>
<p id="p-0050" num="0049">In some embodiments, the base <b>20</b> may include a plurality of pull regions <b>22</b>. The pull regions <b>22</b> may be, for example, a flattened region on the circular outer circumference of the bottom <b>20</b> to provide ease in transitioning the bowl from the collapsed configuration to the expanded configuration.</p>
<p id="p-0051" num="0050">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>7</b> through <b>8</b></figref>, a lid <b>14</b> can be configured to fit over the open end of the bowl. In some embodiments, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>7</b>A and <b>7</b>B</figref>, a lid <b>14</b>A can be designed with indented handles <b>24</b> that permit a package <b>26</b> to be retained therebetween. The package <b>26</b> may be, for example, a salad dressing that can be packaged inside the closed bowl assembly <b>10</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0052" num="0051">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>9</b></figref>, in some embodiments, a bowl assembly <b>10</b>A can include a bowl with structural reliefs <b>28</b> disposed between each of the configuration transition side members to permit the bowl to change configurations. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>10</b></figref> shows an embodiment of a bowl assembly <b>10</b>B with both the structural reliefs <b>28</b> as well as notched regions <b>30</b> disposed as generally linear notches in the configuration transition side members.</p>
<p id="p-0053" num="0052">While <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>1</b>-<b>6</b></figref>, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>8</b></figref> and <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>9</b></figref> show various configuration transition side members, regardless of the embodiment, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>13</b></figref>, an outer circumference <b>40</b> of the configuration transition side member <b>16</b>A is maintained in a constant position, while the inside circumference <b>42</b> moves as the configuration transition side member <b>16</b>A changes between the expanded and collapsed configurations. When the side member <b>16</b>A is generally parallel to a base (not shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>13</b></figref>, see base <b>20</b> in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG.  <b>2</b></figref>, for example), the inside circumference <b>42</b> is reduced, resulting in the flexing as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>13</b></figref>. The structural reliefs <b>28</b> help permit this flexing.</p>
<p id="p-0054" num="0053">Various parameters of the structural reliefs <b>28</b> and/or notched regions <b>18</b>, <b>30</b> may influence the transition between the collapsed and expanded configurations. In addition to the number of structural reliefs and/or notches, the depth and width of the structural reliefs and/or notches are also important in determining how easily the bowl transitions and stays in the expanded bowl state once transitioned. If the structural reliefs and/or notches are few, small in width or depth, the bowl will not transition easily and will stay in the bowl shape once transitioned therein. The more in number, wider and/or deeper structural reliefs and/or notches, will make facilitation easier but has the potential for the bowl not to be stable in the expanded state, as it may be prone to go back to the collapsed state.</p>
<p id="p-0055" num="0054">Similarly, the notched regions <b>18</b>, <b>30</b> also help permit this flexing. In some embodiments, a configuration transition side member <b>16</b>X, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>14</b></figref>, may be formed as side member <b>16</b>B or <b>16</b>C, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>15</b> and <b>16</b></figref>, with hinged region <b>44</b> and relief region <b>46</b>, which may take various forms to permit configuration change.</p>
<p id="p-0056" num="0055">Referring back to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>11</b> and <b>12</b></figref>, various considerations are taken to determine the optimal configuration for permitting flexing of the configuration transition side members to change between the expanded and collapsed configurations. D<sub>0</sub> refers to the inside diameter of one of the configuration transition side members <b>16</b>A in an expanded configuration. I<sub>w</sub> refers to the width of the side member <b>16</b>A. As can be seen from <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>12</b></figref>, as the axis of the side member <b>16</b>A along the width, I<sub>w</sub>, indicated by line <b>36</b>, is moved from the expanded configuration (as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>11</b></figref>) to the transition position, indicated by line <b>32</b>, through angle theta, where arrow <b>34</b> indicates the side member&#x2019;s movement, the D<sub>0</sub> is decreased to a D(transition). Center line <b>38</b> shows an axis orthogonal to the base <b>20</b> of the bowl. This reduction in diameter results in the transition mode shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>13</b></figref>. As movement continues to the collapsed configuration (see <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b>B</figref>), the D(transition) is permitted to enlarge back to the D<sub>0</sub>, thereby locking the bowl in the collapsed configuration. In other words, the transition configuration, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>13</b></figref> is a higher energy state that requires energy to move between the collapsed and expanded configurations, and, when the bowl is in either the collapsed or expanded configuration, this &#x201c;ground state&#x201d; configuration is locked in so that undesired transition does not occur.</p>
<p id="p-0057" num="0056">Several factors have been considered with respect to flipping performance, including number and size of the notched regions <b>18</b>, diameter and thickness of the configuration transition side members, steepness of the angle of the side members in the expanded configuration, and the like. In some embodiments, 5 to 30 notched regions <b>18</b>, typically 7 to 11 notched regions <b>18</b> for single portion salad bowls, may be disposed equidistantly about each of the configuration transition side members <b>16</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0058" num="0057">Additionally, the material used for the bowl may influence the flipping performance. However, because of the ability to vary the size, shape and number of the notched regions, for example, one can make use of a wide variety of packaging materials, such as different plastics and the like.</p>
<p id="p-0059" num="0058">Referring now to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>17</b> through <b>20</b></figref>, a bowl <b>50</b> can include the features discussed above with respect to bowl assembly <b>10</b> and may further include a depression <b>52</b> formed on a bottom surface <b>54</b> thereof. In some embodiments, the depression <b>52</b> may extend into the interior of the bowl <b>50</b> as a protrusion therein. In other embodiments, the depression <b>52</b> may be of a depth to minimize protrusion into the bowl <b>50</b>. For example, a thickness of the bottom surface <b>54</b> of the bowl <b>50</b> may be made thick enough to permit the depression <b>52</b> to be formed on the outside of the bottom surface <b>54</b> of the bowl <b>50</b> while minimizing the protrusion into the interior of the bowl <b>50</b>. In other embodiments, the depth of the depression <b>52</b> may approximate a height of the protrusion into the bowl.</p>
<p id="p-0060" num="0059">Regardless of configuration, the depression <b>52</b> may provide a finger hold for the bowl <b>50</b> and may also provide a location for a user to carry, balance and/or spin to bowl on one&#x2019;s finger.</p>
<p id="p-0061" num="0060">In some embodiments, the bowl assembly <b>10</b> (or the bowl <b>50</b>) may include one or more air vents (not shown). The air vents may be formed, for example, as slits cut into the lid <b>14</b> or bowl <b>12</b> of the bowl assembly <b>10</b>. Typically, the air vents may be designed to permit air exchange into and out of the bowl <b>12</b> while the lid <b>14</b> is still attached to the bowl <b>12</b>. Thus, with the air vents, a user may be able to change the configuration of the bowl assembly <b>10</b> between the expanded and collapsed configurations without creating a reduced or increased pressure inside the bowl <b>12</b>. In some embodiments, the air vents may be formed along the lid sealing region to the bowl.</p>
