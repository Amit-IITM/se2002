<heading id="h-0007" level="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION</heading>
<p id="p-0041" num="0040">Reference will now be made in detail to various embodiments of the present technology, which relate to a reversible hairclip. Although certain specific embodiments of the present technology are described, the present technology is not limited to these embodiments. On the contrary, these described embodiments are merely illustrative of the present technology, and the present technology is intended to also cover alternatives, modifications, and equivalents. Furthermore, in the following detailed description, numerous specific details are set forth in order to provide a thorough understanding of the present technology. However, it will be recognized by one of ordinary skill in the art that embodiments can be practiced without these specific details. In some instances, well known methods, procedures, compounds, compositions and mechanisms have not been described in detail as not to unnecessarily obscure aspects of embodiments of the present technology.</p>
<p id="p-0042" num="0041"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>1</b>A-<b>4</b></figref> illustrate an embodiment of a reversible hairclip <b>100</b>. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>1</b>A-<b>1</b>B</figref>, the reversible hairclip <b>100</b> may be worn by a user to pull their hair back into a ponytail or other hairstyle. The reversible hairclip <b>100</b>, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>2</b>A-<b>2</b>B</figref>, can include a band <b>110</b> and a curved pin <b>120</b>. The band <b>110</b> may comprise a generally <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>8</b></figref> shape, though other shapes, such as an oval, a triangle, square, rectangle, or any other shape, design, or pattern can be used as well (e.g., see <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>9</b>A-<b>9</b>C</figref> for examples of designs that can be used). Although the band <b>110</b> is depicted as substantially straight and the curved pin <b>120</b> is depicted as curved, in some embodiments, the band <b>110</b> can be curved and the pin <b>120</b> can be straight. Moreover, both the band <b>110</b> and the pin <b>120</b> could be substantially straight or curved.</p>
<p id="p-0043" num="0042">In some aspects, the band <b>110</b> can comprise flexible, inelastic material. For example, the band <b>110</b> can comprise an interior spring <b>130</b> (shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref>) coated with an exterior material. The interior spring <b>130</b> may comprise a metal or an annealed metal (e.g., zinc, steel) with spring-like properties. For example, the spring <b>130</b> may comprise a 0.3 mm cold-rolled spring steel with a hardness rated between about 42-46 Rockwell C. Although specific dimensions and hardnesses are described, other dimensions and hardnesses are contemplated and are within the scope of the present invention. The interior spring <b>130</b> is configured to bend, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref>, such that the reversible hairclip <b>100</b> can secure different hair thicknesses and different hairstyles.</p>
<p id="p-0044" num="0043">The exterior material coating the interior spring <b>130</b> may comprise a plastic material, such as polypropylene, thermoplastic elastomer, or the like. The exterior material may comprise a combination of two or more materials. For example, the interior spring <b>130</b> can have an injection overmold of polypropylene to provide stabilization in the secondary injection process to prevent the interior spring <b>130</b> from moving during the second overmold. Further, the interior spring <b>130</b> can have a second injection overmold of thermoplastic elastomer. The shore hardness of the exterior material is configured to sufficiently grip the user's hair in use. In some aspects, the exterior material comprises a shore hardness of about Shore 30A. In some aspects, the exterior material comprises a shore hardness of about Shore 30D to about Shore 10A. Although specific shore hardnesses are described, other shore hardnesses are contemplated and are within the scope of the present invention. A material with the described shore hardness can provide strength that prevents band <b>110</b> from indentation or deformation while still allowing the necessary flexibility to conform to the hair and desired curvature. The exterior material can also be resistant enough to bend without cracking or breaking ensuring enclosure and protection of the interior material throughout use and repeated bending of the band <b>110</b>. In some aspects, the exterior material is waterproof, which prevents the interior spring <b>130</b> from contacting a fluid. The combination of the interior spring <b>130</b> overmolded with, for example, polypropylene Shore 30A, allows the band <b>110</b> to comfortably curve and grip onto objects, which gives the band <b>110</b> a flexible grip and soft-touch application. In some variants, the band <b>110</b> can comprise a single material.</p>
<p id="p-0045" num="0044">In some embodiments, the band <b>110</b> comprises a first loop <b>116</b>, a second loop <b>118</b>, and middle section <b>114</b> between the first and second loops <b>116</b>, <b>118</b>. The middle section <b>114</b> may comprise a circular structure that can be configured to display a label or a logo (e.g., the circular structure <b>114</b>, <b>214</b> shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>2</b>A and <b>5</b>A</figref>). The first and second loops <b>116</b>, <b>118</b> may comprise a first end <b>115</b> and a second end <b>111</b>, respectively. In some aspects, the first end <b>115</b> may comprise a first indented portion <b>113</b> and the second end <b>111</b> may comprise a second indented portion <b>112</b>. The first and second indented portions <b>113</b>, <b>112</b> can comprise outer diameters that are smaller than the outer diameter of the remainder of the band <b>110</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0046" num="0045">In some aspects, the band <b>110</b> may comprise a length of between approximately 40 millimeters to approximately 120 millimeters, approximately 50 millimeters to approximately 110 millimeters, approximately 60 millimeters to approximately 110 millimeters, approximately 70 millimeters to approximately 100 millimeters, or approximately 80 millimeters to approximately 90 millimeters. In some aspects, the band <b>110</b> may comprise a width of between approximately 10 millimeters to 50 millimeters, approximately 15 millimeters to approximately 45 millimeters, approximately 20 millimeters to approximately 40 millimeters, or approximately 25 millimeters to approximately 35 millimeters. Although specific lengths are described, other lengths of the band <b>110</b> are contemplated and are within the scope of the present invention.</p>
<p id="p-0047" num="0046">As described above, the reversible hair clip <b>100</b> can include a curved pin <b>120</b>. The curved pin <b>120</b> may comprise any suitable material, such as a metal (e.g., zinc, steel) or a plastic (e.g., polycarbonate, glass-reinforced polycarbonate). In some aspects, the curved pin <b>120</b> may comprise a radius of curvature of approximately 160 millimeters. In some aspects, the curved pin <b>120</b> may comprise a radius of curvature of between approximately 120 millimeters to approximately 180 millimeters, approximately 130 millimeters to approximately 170 millimeters, or approximately 140 millimeters to approximately 150 millimeters. In some aspects, the curved pin <b>120</b> may comprise a length of between approximately 50 millimeters to approximately 150 millimeters, approximately 60 millimeters to approximately 140 millimeters, approximately 70 millimeters to approximately 130 millimeters, approximately 80 millimeters to approximately 120 millimeters, or approximately 90 millimeters to approximately 110 millimeters. Although specific lengths are described, other lengths of the curved pin <b>120</b> are contemplated and are within the scope of the present invention.</p>
<p id="p-0048" num="0047">In some embodiments, the curved pin <b>120</b> may comprise a knob <b>122</b>, a slot <b>126</b>, and a tip end <b>124</b>. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b></figref>, the knob <b>122</b> of the curved pin <b>120</b>, according to some embodiments, can comprise a first portion <b>122</b><i>a </i>and a second portion <b>122</b><i>b</i>. During manufacturing, the first indented portion <b>113</b> of the band <b>110</b> can be inserted between the first and second portions <b>122</b><i>a</i>, <b>122</b><i>b </i>of the knob <b>122</b> and into the slot <b>126</b>. After the band <b>110</b> is inserted into the slot <b>126</b>, the first and second portions <b>122</b><i>a</i>, <b>122</b><i>b </i>of the knob <b>122</b> can be sonically welded together, adhered together, welded together, or otherwise attached. The knob <b>122</b> can comprise a generally circular shape as well as other shapes, such as a generally cylindrical shape (e.g., the knob <b>222</b> shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>5</b>A-<b>5</b>B</figref>). In some embodiments, the knob <b>122</b> is configured to pass through the first loop <b>116</b> of the band <b>110</b> such that the curved pin <b>120</b> may rotate about the band <b>110</b>, as further described below with reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b>B</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0049" num="0048">In some aspects, the slot <b>126</b> of the curved pin <b>120</b> may comprise a length of between approximately 10 millimeters to approximately 80 millimeters, approximately 20 millimeters to approximately 70 millimeters, approximately 30 millimeters to approximately 60 millimeters, or approximately 40 millimeters to approximately 50 millimeters. Although specific lengths are described, other lengths of the slot <b>126</b> are contemplated and are within the scope of the present invention.</p>
<p id="p-0050" num="0049">As described above, the curved pin <b>120</b> can comprise a rigid material, such as plastic, that maintains the curvature of the curved pin <b>120</b>. Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b>B</figref>, in some embodiments, the curved pin <b>120</b> may comprise a plurality of notches <b>128</b><i>a </i>on a second longitudinal side <b>132</b><i>b </i>(e.g., a concave side) of the curved pin <b>120</b> adjacent the tip end <b>124</b> and a plurality of notches <b>128</b><i>b </i>on a first longitudinal side <b>132</b><i>a </i>(e.g., a convex side) of the curved pin <b>120</b> adjacent the tip end <b>124</b>. The plurality of notches <b>128</b><i>a</i>, <b>128</b><i>b </i>can include any number of notches (e.g., two notches, three notches, four notches, five notches, or more than five notches). In some configurations, the curved pin <b>120</b> may comprise a single notch <b>128</b><i>a</i>, <b>128</b><i>b </i>on the first longitudinal side <b>132</b><i>a </i>and/or the second longitudinal side <b>132</b><i>b</i>. The number of notches <b>128</b><i>a </i>on the second longitudinal side <b>132</b><i>b </i>can be the same or different than the number of notches <b>128</b><i>b </i>on the first longitudinal side <b>132</b><i>a</i>. For example, the first longitudinal side <b>132</b><i>a </i>may have no notches and the second longitudinal side <b>132</b><i>b </i>may have two notches <b>128</b><i>a</i>. Alternatively, the first longitudinal side <b>132</b><i>a </i>may have two notches <b>128</b><i>b </i>and the second longitudinal side <b>132</b><i>b </i>may have four notches <b>128</b><i>a</i>. In some aspects, the plurality of notches <b>128</b><i>a</i>, <b>128</b><i>b </i>may be configured to engage with the second indented portion <b>112</b> to secure the user's hair in use. In some aspects, the plurality of notches <b>128</b><i>a</i>, <b>128</b><i>b </i>can be configured to retain the tip end <b>124</b> of the pin within the second loop <b>118</b> of the band <b>110</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0051" num="0050">In some aspects, the slot <b>126</b> of the curved pin <b>120</b> may be configured to receive the first indented portion <b>113</b> of band <b>110</b>. The first indented portion <b>113</b> of the band <b>110</b> can be configured to move along the length of the slot <b>126</b>. The curved pin <b>120</b> may be configured to rotate about an axis of the band <b>110</b> that runs through the length of the first indented portion <b>113</b> such that the knob <b>122</b> of the pin <b>120</b> can pass through the first loop <b>116</b>. The curved pin's <b>120</b> ability to rotate about the first indented portion <b>113</b> of the band <b>110</b> allows the plurality of notches <b>128</b><i>a</i>, <b>128</b><i>b </i>on the concave and convex sides <b>132</b><i>b</i>, <b>132</b><i>a </i>of the pin <b>120</b> to be able to engage with the second indented portion <b>112</b> of the band <b>110</b>. This rotation, the plurality of notches <b>128</b><i>a</i>, <b>128</b><i>b </i>on both sides of the pin <b>120</b>, and the concave and convex sides <b>132</b><i>b</i>, <b>132</b><i>a </i>of the pin <b>120</b> allow the hairclip <b>100</b> to be reversible and to accommodate different hair thicknesses and different hairstyles. For example, a user with thick hair may use a notch of the plurality of notches <b>128</b><i>a</i>, <b>128</b><i>b </i>closest to the tip end <b>124</b> to secure their hair with the pin <b>120</b>. Or the user may wear the hairclip <b>100</b> such that the hair of the user is secured between the band <b>110</b> and the concave side <b>132</b><i>b </i>of the curved pin <b>120</b>. Alternatively, a user with thinner hair may use a notch of the plurality of notches <b>128</b><i>a</i>, <b>128</b><i>b </i>furthest from the tip end <b>124</b>. Or the user may wear the hairclip <b>100</b> such that the hair of the user is secured between the band <b>110</b> and the convex side <b>132</b><i>a </i>of the curved pin <b>120</b>. Moreover, a user may use the hairclip <b>100</b> with one hairstyle and rotate the curved pin <b>120</b> about the band <b>110</b> to wear the hairclip <b>100</b> with a different hair style.</p>
