<heading level="1" id="h-0002">BACKGROUND</heading>
<heading level="1" id="h-0003">1. Field</heading>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">The present disclosure relates generally to signal processing, and more particularly, to an electronic device for a hearing test using distortion production otoacoustic emissions and a control method thereof.</p>
<heading level="1" id="h-0004">2. Description of Related Art</heading>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">As technology advances, related services and functions are being provided through related electronic devices (e.g., smartphones, or other portable electronic devices). As a result, due to increases in the use of personal listening devices, a growing number of users may experience hearing loss.</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">Accordingly, manufacturers of related electronic devices may have more of an interest in the area of personal hearing test and care on an electronic device.</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">Related hearing tests may include, but not be limited to, pure tone audiometry (PTA), transient evoked otoacoustic emissions (TEOAEs), and distortion production otoacoustic emissions.</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">A PTA may refer to a manual test performed by letting the user listen to pure tones generated in an anechoic chamber and press a button. A PTA test may have a benefit in that the test may allow for testing on various auditory organs. However, the PTA test may have a drawback in that the test may need a long term test, when compared to other related hearing tests.</p>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">In a transient evoked otoacoustic emissions test, a sound having a wide frequency range may be momentarily output through a speaker, and the responding sound may be received through a microphone with a delay. This test may check for the condition of hair cells for each frequency based on the response characteristics over time. The transient evoked otoacoustic emissions test may be performed on each ear using one speaker. However, the speaker may be vulnerable to ambient noise and, as a result, the test may have poor accuracy.</p>
<p id="p-0009" num="0008">The distortion production otoacoustic emissions test may output two pure signals having the frequencies of f1 and f2 for both ears, respectively, may receive the responding sound through a microphone, and may test hearing based on a third-order low-frequency inter-modulation distorted signal (e.g., having a frequency of 2f1 - f2) which, while not outputted by the test equipment, may be included in the responding sound. As a result, the distortion production otoacoustic emissions test may have the advantages of having a high accuracy and being resistant to noise, when compared to other related hearing tests.</p>
<p id="p-0010" num="0009">While the distortion production otoacoustic emissions test may be advantageous for early detection of hearing loss, the test may require two speakers for each ear, respectively, to prevent unwanted distorted signals. That is, since two speakers must operate separately in one listening device corresponding to one ear, two sound processors and two drivers for channel control may be needed for each ear. Moreover, in order to test on both ears at the same time, two sound processors and two drivers may be needed for each ear (e.g., four sound processors and four drivers in total), which may pose limitations on the hardware needed for performing a hearing test using distortion production otoacoustic emissions.</p>
<p id="p-0011" num="0010">Thus, there exists a need for further improvements in performing hearing tests, as the need for using distortion production otoacoustic emissions may be constrained by the hardware needed to perform the hearing test. Improvements are presented herein. These improvements may also be applicable to other multi-audio signal processing technologies and to the standards that employ these technologies.</p>
<heading level="1" id="h-0005">SUMMARY</heading>
<p id="p-0012" num="0011">According to various aspects of the present disclosure, there are provided electronic devices capable of performing a distortion production otoacoustic emissions-based hearing test even with a single speaker operating on a channel for each ear by combining a sound signal for test and an anti-phase signal for canceling off the distorted signal related to the distortion production otoacoustic emissions and a control method thereof.</p>
<p id="p-0013" num="0012">According to an aspect of the present disclosure, an electronic device is provided. The electronic device includes a speaker, a microphone, a memory storing instructions and a plurality of protocols, a digital signal processor (DSP), a driver, and a processor operatively coupled with the speaker, the microphone, the memory, the DSP, and the driver. The driver is configured to convert a digital signal output from the DSP into an analog signal and output the analog signal to the speaker. The processor is configured to execute the instructions to control the DSP to obtain a first sound signal by combining a first signal, a second signal, and a first anti-phase signal, based on a first protocol from among the plurality of protocols. The first anti-phase signal has a third frequency related to a distortion production otoacoustic emission (DPOAE) of a first frequency of the first signal and a second frequency of the second signal. The processor is further configured to control the driver to output, through the speaker, the first sound signal. The processor is further configured to receive, through the microphone, a second sound signal related to the first sound signal, in response to the output of the first sound signal. The processor is further configured to extract, from the second sound signal, a first DPOAE signal of the third frequency. The processor is further configured to control the DSP to obtain a third sound signal by combining a fourth signal, a fifth signal, and a second anti-phase signal, based on a second protocol among the plurality of protocols. The second anti-phase signal having a sixth frequency related to a DPOAE of a fourth frequency of the fourth signal and a fifth frequency of the fifth signal. The processor is further configured to control the driver to output, through the speaker, the third sound signal. The processor is further configured to receive, through the microphone, a fourth sound signal related to the third sound signal, in response to the output of the third sound signal. The processor is further configured to extract, from the fourth sound signal, a second DPOAE signal of the sixth frequency. The processor is further configured to obtain a user hearing profile based on the first DPOAE signal and the second DPOAE signal. The processor is further configured to perform, based on the user hearing profile, at least one of a sound volume change and an equalization (EQ) change of a sound to be output.</p>
<p id="p-0014" num="0013">According to an aspect of the present disclosure, a method for controlling an electronic device is provided. The method includes outputting, through a speaker of the electronic device, a first sound signal obtained by combining a first signal having a first frequency, a second signal having a second frequency, and a first anti-phase signal having a third frequency related to a DPOAE of the first frequency and the second frequency, based on a first protocol from among a plurality of protocols stored in a memory of the electronic device. The method further includes, in response to receiving, through a microphone of the electronic device, a second sound signal related to the first sound signal, extracting, from the second sound signal, a first DPOAE signal of the third frequency. The method further includes outputting, through the speaker, a third sound signal obtained by combining a fourth signal having a fourth frequency, a fifth signal having a fifth frequency, and a second anti-phase signal having a sixth frequency related to a DPOAE of the fourth frequency and the fifth frequency, based on a second protocol from among the plurality of protocols. The method further includes, in response to receiving, through the microphone, a fourth sound signal related to the third sound signal extracting, from the fourth sound signal, a second DPOAE signal of the sixth frequency. The method further includes obtaining a user hearing profile based on the first DPOAE signal and the second DPOAE signal. The method further includes performing, based on the user hearing profile, at least one of a sound volume change and an EQ change of a sound to be output.</p>
<p id="p-0015" num="0014">According to an aspect of the present disclosure, an electronic device is provided. The electronic device includes a memory storing instructions, and a processor operatively coupled with the memory.

Thus, the phrases &#x201c;in one embodiment&#x201d;, &#x201c;in an embodiment,&#x201d; &#x201c;in an example embodiment,&#x201d; and similar language throughout this disclosure may, but do not necessarily, all refer to the same embodiment.</p>
<p id="p-0040" num="0039">It is to be understood that the specific order or hierarchy of blocks in the processes/flowcharts disclosed are an illustration of exemplary approaches. Based upon design preferences, it is understood that the specific order or hierarchy of blocks in the processes/flowcharts may be rearranged. Further, some blocks may be combined or omitted.

<p id="p-0041" num="0040">Hereinafter, various embodiments of the present disclosure are described with reference to the accompanying drawings.</p>
<p id="p-0042" num="0041"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref> illustrates a hearing test system using distortion production otoacoustic emissions (DPOAEs), according to an embodiment.</p>
<p id="p-0043" num="0042">According to an embodiment, the hearing test system may include an electronic device <b>100</b>. The electronic device <b>100</b> may output a sound and then receive a sound generated from an ear of the user <b>10</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0044" num="0043">According to an embodiment, the electronic device <b>100</b> may determine whether the hearing of the user <b>10</b> is normal based on a distortion production otoacoustic emission signal from among the sounds generated from the ear of the user <b>10</b>, according to the output of the sound. For example, the electronic device <b>100</b> may output a single sound signal which is a combination of a plurality of signals having different frequencies through a single speaker <b>150</b>. The plurality of signals having the different frequencies may include a pure tone signal of a first frequency, a pure tone signal of a second frequency, a plurality of inter-modulation distorted signals related to the pure tone signal of the first frequency and the pure tone signal of the second frequency, and an anti-phase signal of the distortion production otoacoustic emission frequency among the plurality of inter-modulation distorted signals. An operation of combining the plurality of signals is described below with reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b>A</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0045" num="0044">The inter-modulation distortion may refer distortion caused as two independent input signals are combined in a filter. That is, the inter-modulation distortion may refer to non-linear distortion by which the frequencies generated by linear combination of the fundamental frequency of the input signal and the harmonics are included in the output signal. For example, when a first signal with a first frequency (e.g., f1) and a second signal with a second frequency (e.g., f2) are combined, a plurality of inter-modulation distorted signals may be generated, such as, but not limited to, signals with frequencies of f2 - f1, 2f1 - f2, and 2f2 - f1.</p>
<p id="p-0046" num="0045">Otoacoustic emissions may refer to sound energy generated spontaneously and/or amplified by sound stimulation in the outer hair cells of the cochlea. That is, otoacoustic emissions may occur regardless of whether the auditory nerve is severed or not. Alternatively or additionally, otoacoustic emissions may not appear when insensitive to changes in external conditions and/or in cochlear hearing loss. Otoacoustic emissions may allow for checking on (e.g., testing for) abnormalities in the cochlea and/or auditory hair cells within a relatively short time in a simplified manner without harming the auditory function. Consequently, otoacoustic emissions may be used as to obtain an early diagnosis of hearing loss and for objective tests, such as, but not limited to, hearing tests for newborns and children.</p>
<p id="p-0047" num="0046">Distortion production otoacoustic emissions may be a type of otoacoustic emissions. Distortion production otoacoustic emissions may refer to otoacoustic emissions of various frequencies that may occur at the overlapping part of two pure tone stimulating sounds having two different frequencies (e.g., first signal f1, second signal f2) that have been applied simultaneously. That is, the distortion production otoacoustic emissions may be a product (e.g., a result) of the non-linear distortion caused by the cochlea. The reaction size of the distortion production otoacoustic emissions may be affected by the relative and/or absolute strengths of the pure tones and the frequency ratio of the pure tones. For example, when the frequency ratio is 1.2 (e.g., f2 = 1.2 x f1) and the strength of the first signal f1 is higher (e.g., greater) than the strength of the second signal f2 by approximately 5 to 10 decibel of sound pressure level (dB SPL), a strong reaction (e.g., distortion) may occur at a frequency between 2f1 and f2.</p>
<p id="p-0048" num="0047">In an embodiment, the electronic device <b>100</b> may repeat the operation of adjusting the frequency of the sound and outputting the adjusted sound. Alternatively or additionally, the electronic device <b>100</b> may repeat the operation of receiving the distortion production otoacoustic emission for the (adjusted) output sound. That is, the electronic device <b>100</b> may obtain the user&#x2019;s hearing profile based on the plurality of distortion production otoacoustic emission signals received.</p>
<p id="p-0049" num="0048">According to various embodiments, the electronic device <b>100</b> may include an ear probe and output the sound with the ear probe partially inserted in the outer ear of the user <b>10</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0050" num="0049">According to various embodiments, the ear probe of the electronic device <b>100</b> may not only be inserted into the outer ear of the user <b>10</b>, but also may be wrapped around a part of the ear of the user <b>10</b> from the outside. That is, at least one portion of the electronic device <b>100</b> may be disposed inserted in the outer ear and at least another portion of the electronic device <b>100</b> may be disposed around the outside of the ear.</p>
<p id="p-0051" num="0050">According to an embodiment, the hearing test system may further include an external device <b>200</b> communicating with the electronic device <b>100</b>. The electronic device <b>100</b> may output the stored sound and/or may receive a sound signal from the external device <b>200</b> and output the obtained sound. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>, the electronic device <b>100</b> and the external device <b>200</b> may communicate wirelessly, but the present disclosure is not limited in this regard. For example, the electronic device <b>100</b> and the external device <b>200</b> may communicate with each other wiredly, wirelessly, or a combination thereof.</p>
<p id="p-0052" num="0051">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>, the external device <b>200</b> may be in the form of a smart phone in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>. However, the present disclosure is not limited in this regard. For example, the external device <b>200</b> may include any device capable of communicating with the electronic device <b>100</b>, such as, but not limited to, a desktop personal computer (PC), a television (TV), a compact disc (CD) player, a Moving Picture Experts Group Phase 1 (MPEG-1) Audio Layer III (MP3) player, or a server.</p>
<p id="p-0053" num="0052">Continuing to refer to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>, one earphone may be worn on one ear of the user <b>10</b> as the electronic device <b>100</b>. However, the present disclosure is not limited in this regard. For example, a plurality of electronic devices <b>100</b> may be worn on both ears of the user <b>10</b>, respectively.</p>
<p id="p-0054" num="0053"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref> illustrates an electronic device <b>100</b>, according to an embodiment. The electronic device <b>100</b> in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref> may be one of a plurality of earphones worn on the user&#x2019;s both ears.</p>
<p id="p-0055" num="0054">According to an embodiment, the electronic device <b>100</b> may include a memory <b>110</b>, a processor <b>120</b>, a digital signal processor (DSP) <b>130</b>, a driver <b>140</b>, a speaker <b>150</b>, and a microphone <b>160</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0056" num="0055">According to an embodiment, a plurality of protocols for a hearing test may be stored in the memory <b>110</b>. The protocol may include information about two different frequencies (e.g., f1 and f2) for a hearing test in a specific frequency range and information about the anti-phase signal of the distortion production otoacoustic emission frequency of a plurality of inter-modulation distorted signals caused by a combination of the signals of the two different frequencies. For example, the distortion production otoacoustic emission frequency may be 2f1 - f2 as the frequency of the third-order low-frequency inter-modulation distortion. According to an embodiment, the frequency ranges to be measured by the plurality of protocols, respectively, may at least partially differ.</p>
<p id="p-0057" num="0056">According to an embodiment, the processor <b>120</b> may execute software (e.g., a program) to control at least one other component (e.g., a hardware or software component) of the electronic device <b>100</b> connected with the processor <b>120</b> and may process and/or compute various data. According to one embodiment, as at least part of the data processing or computation, the processor <b>120</b> may store a command and/or data received from another component (e.g., sensor module or communication module, not shown) and store the result data in the memory <b>110</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0058" num="0057">According to an embodiment, the processor <b>120</b> may obtain (&#x2460;) at least one protocol from the memory <b>110</b> and may control the DSP <b>130</b> to generate (&#x2461;) a first sound based on one of the obtained at least one protocol.</p>
<p id="p-0059" num="0058">According to an embodiment, the DSP <b>130</b> may process digital signals under the control of the processor <b>120</b>. For example, the DSP <b>130</b> may output the first sound signal through one channel per speaker <b>150</b> corresponding to one ear of the user. The first sound signal may be a sound signal for detecting distortion production otoacoustic emission.</p>
<p id="p-0060" num="0059">For example, the DSP <b>130</b> may combine the two signals having different frequencies and the signal for canceling off the inter-modulation distorted signal having the same frequency as the distortion production otoacoustic emission generated due to the combination of the two signals based on the protocol for the hearing test and output the combined signal to the driver <b>140</b>. The operation of combining the signals is described below with reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b>A</figref>. Thus, it may be possible to perform a hearing test based on distortion production otoacoustic emissions using only one speaker <b>150</b> for each ear.</p>
<p id="p-0061" num="0060">According to an embodiment, the driver <b>140</b> may convert the digital signal received from the DSP <b>130</b> into an analog signal and output the analog signal to the speaker <b>150</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0062" num="0061">According to an embodiment, the speaker <b>150</b> may output (&#x2462;) the first sound signal to the outside of the electronic device <b>100</b>. For example, the speaker <b>150</b> may be disposed on a part of the ear probe of the electronic device <b>100</b> to output the first sound signal.</p>
<p id="p-0063" num="0062">According to an embodiment, the microphone <b>160</b> may receive an external sound signal of the electronic device <b>100</b>. The microphone <b>160</b> may receive the analog signal and convert it into a digital signal, and transfer the converted digital signal to the DSP <b>130</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0064" num="0063">For example, the microphone <b>160</b> may be disposed on a part of the ear probe of the electronic device <b>100</b> and, after the first sound signal is output through the speaker <b>150</b>, the microphone <b>160</b> may receive (&#x2463;) a second sound signal related to the output first sound signal. For example, a distortion production otoacoustic emission signal generated in the cochlea of the user due to the output first sound signal may be included in the second sound signal related to the output first sound signal.</p>
<p id="p-0065" num="0064">According to an embodiment, the DSP <b>130</b> may extract (&#x2464;) the distortion production otoacoustic emission signal from the second sound signal received through the microphone <b>160</b>. For example, the frequency of the distortion production otoacoustic emission signal may be 2f1 - f2 based on the frequencies f1 and f2 of the two pure tone signals included in the first sound signal.</p>
<p id="p-0066" num="0065">According to various embodiments, the second sound signal received through the microphone <b>160</b> may be transferred to the processor <b>120</b>. The operation of extracting the distortion production otoacoustic emission signal from the second sound signal may be performed by the processor <b>120</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0067" num="0066">According to various embodiments, the processor <b>120</b> may measure external noise through the microphone <b>160</b> and determine whether to perform a hearing test based on the external noise measurement results.</p>
<p id="p-0068" num="0067">According to an embodiment, the processor <b>120</b> may obtain (&#x2465;) the user&#x2019;s hearing profile based on the extracted distortion production otoacoustic emission signal. For example, the processor <b>120</b> may determine whether the user&#x2019;s hearing is normal in a specific frequency range based on the strength of the extracted distortion production otoacoustic emission signal relative to the strength of the first frequency signal and the strength of the second frequency signal included in the output first sound signal.</p>
<p id="p-0069" num="0068">According to an embodiment, the processor <b>120</b> may change protocols and repeat the operation of outputting the sound signal for a hearing test and the operation of extracting the distortion production otoacoustic emission signal. Thus, the processor <b>120</b> may obtain the user&#x2019;s hearing profile in a plurality of frequency ranges based on a plurality of distortion production otoacoustic emission signals.</p>
<p id="p-0070" num="0069">According to an embodiment, the processor <b>120</b> may perform (&#x2466;) sound volume change and/or equalization (EQ) change based on the obtained user hearing profile. For example, upon determining that the user&#x2019;s hearing is deteriorated based on the user hearing profile, the processor <b>120</b> may control the speaker <b>150</b> to reduce the volume of the output sound signal.</p>
<p id="p-0071" num="0070">In an optional or additional embodiment, the processor <b>120</b> may change the equalization based on the user&#x2019;s hearing profile. Equalization may refer to partially adjusting the sound signal from a low pitch to a high pitch, according to the music genre or the user&#x2019;s taste. For example, the processor <b>120</b> may change the equalization so that the difference in strength (e.g., volume) between the plurality of frequencies included in the sound signal to be output falls within a set range based on the user&#x2019;s hearing profile.</p>
<p id="p-0072" num="0071">For example, the processor <b>120</b> may change the equalization to reduce the volume of a specific frequency signal in the sound signal based on the user&#x2019;s hearing profile.</p>
<p id="p-0073" num="0072">According to various embodiments, when the user&#x2019;s personal equalization is pre-stored, the processor <b>120</b> may update the user&#x2019;s hearing profile with the pre-stored equalization. According to an optional or additional embodiment, when the user&#x2019;s personal equalization is absent, the processor <b>120</b> may store the equalization changed based on the user&#x2019;s hearing profile.</p>
<p id="p-0074" num="0073">Thus, it may be possible to obtain equalization customized for each user to fit the user&#x2019;s hearing condition.</p>
<p id="p-0075" num="0074">According to various embodiments, upon determining that the user&#x2019;s hearing is deteriorated based on the user&#x2019;s hearing profile, the processor <b>120</b> may provide feedback to notify the user that their hearing is deteriorated. For example, upon determining that the user&#x2019;s hearing is deteriorated, the processor <b>120</b> may display a message indicating the deterioration of hearing on the display of the electronic device <b>100</b> and/or may transmit another message to an external device <b>200</b> and cause the external device <b>200</b> to display the another message on the display of the external device <b>200</b>. In an embodiment, upon determining that the user&#x2019;s hearing is deteriorated, the processor <b>120</b> may output a notification of the deterioration of hearing through the speaker <b>150</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0076" num="0075">According to various embodiments, although not shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref>, the electronic device <b>100</b> may further include at least one of a communication module, a sensor, or a power supply unit.</p>
<p id="p-0077" num="0076"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref> is a flowchart illustrating a method for controlling an electronic device <b>100</b> using distortion production otoacoustic emissions, according to an embodiment.</p>
<p id="p-0078" num="0077">According to an embodiment, in operation <b>310</b>, the electronic device <b>100</b> (e.g., the processor <b>120</b> and/or the DSP <b>130</b>) may output a first sound signal based on a first protocol. For example, the electronic device <b>100</b> may output, through the speaker <b>150</b>, a first sound signal obtained by combining a plurality of signals using the first protocol among a plurality of protocols stored in the memory <b>110</b>. According to an embodiment, the electronic device <b>100</b> may output the first sound signal through the speaker <b>150</b> corresponding to one ear using one channel.</p>
<p id="p-0079" num="0078">For example, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b>A</figref>, the electronic device <b>100</b> may output, through the speaker <b>150</b>, the first sound signal which is a combination of a first signal 410 with a frequency of f1, a second signal 411 with a frequency of f2, and an anti-phase signal 420 with a frequency of 2f1 - f2, which is a frequency related to the distortion production otoacoustic emission of f1 and f2.</p>
<p id="p-0080" num="0079">According to an embodiment, combining two signals to output signals of two different frequencies through one channel may cause a plurality of inter-modulation distorted signals. For example, if the first signal <b>410</b> and the second signal <b>411</b>, then a plurality of inter-modulation distorted signals may be generated, such as, but not limited to, signals with frequencies of f2 - f1, 2f1 - f2, and 2f2 - f1.</p>
<p id="p-0081" num="0080">According to an embodiment, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b>B</figref>, the electronic device <b>100</b> may output, through the speaker <b>150</b>, the first sound signal in which the inter-modulation distorted signal with the frequency of 2f1 - f2 has been canceled out from among the plurality of inter-modulation distorted signals of f1and f2. For example, the inter-modulation distorted signal with the frequency of 2f1 - f2 may have been canceled out by further combining the first sound signal with the anti-phase signal 420 of the inter-modulation distorted signal 412 with the frequency of 2f1 - f2, which is the frequency related to the distortion production otoacoustic emission of f1 and f2 from among the plurality of inter-modulation distorted signals.</p>
<p id="p-0082" num="0081">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref>, according to an embodiment, in operation <b>320</b>, upon receiving the second sound signal related to the first sound signal, the electronic device <b>100</b> may extract the first distortion production otoacoustic emission signal included in the second sound signal.</p>
<p id="p-0083" num="0082">For example, referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b>A</figref>, the electronic device <b>100</b> may output the first sound signal through the speaker <b>150</b> and then receive the second sound signal through the microphone <b>160</b>. For example, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b>C</figref>, the second sound signal received through the microphone <b>160</b> after the first sound signal is output may include a distortion production otoacoustic emission (DPOAE) signal <b>430</b> generated from the ear of the user <b>10</b>, and the electronic device <b>100</b> may extract the DPOAE signal <b>430</b> from the second sound signal. For that reason, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b>B</figref>, the first sound signal that is output is a signal in which the inter-modulation distorted signal <b>412</b> with a frequency of 2f1 - f2 has been canceled out from among the plurality of inter-modulation distorted signals of f1 and f2. As a result, the distortion production otoacoustic emission signal <b>430</b> generated from the cochlea of the user <b>10</b>, stimulated by the pure tone signals whose frequencies are f1 and f2, may be precisely extracted.</p>
<p id="p-0084" num="0083">According to an embodiment, in operation <b>330</b>, the electronic device <b>100</b> may output a third sound signal based on a second protocol. For example, the electronic device <b>100</b> may output, through the speaker <b>150</b>, a third sound signal obtained by combining a plurality of signals using the second protocol from among a plurality of protocols stored in the memory <b>110</b>.
