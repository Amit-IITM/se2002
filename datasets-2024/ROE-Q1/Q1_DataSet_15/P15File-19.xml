<p id="p-0004" num="0003">Early diagnosis and treatment of disease is important for leading a healthy life. Among various diseases, cancer is a serious life-threatening disease, and interest in early diagnosis and treatment of cancer is increasing.</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">On the other hand, in the case of women, the incidence of breast cancer appears to be the highest among cancers such as breast cancer, thyroid cancer, stomach cancer, colon cancer, and lung cancer. Therefore, in order to effectively treat breast cancer, attention has been focused on finding a method for effectively diagnosing breast cancer at an early stage.</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">As a conventional technology for diagnosing breast cancer, mammography is known to detect lesions present inside the breast using X-rays. However, the mammography has a problem in that it is difficult to select cancer from breast tissue because the difference in X-ray absorptivity between the breast tissue and cancer is very small.</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">As a way to solve this problem, there is a method for diagnosing breast cancer using diffuse optical tomography that obtains a two-dimensional or three-dimensional image of the tissue inside the breast using a wavelength of light.</p>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">For example, Korean Patent Unexamined Publication No. 10-2019-0048249 discloses a device and method for diagnosing breast cancer using the diffuse optical tomography.</p>

<p id="p-0049" num="0048"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref> is a block diagram showing a breast cancer diagnosis system according to an example of the present disclosure.</p>
<p id="p-0050" num="0049">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>, a breast cancer diagnosis system <b>1</b> of the present disclosure includes a probe <b>1000</b> for collecting optical data for each chromophore material of breast tissue, a display <b>2000</b> for outputting an interface and an image, and a central control device <b>3000</b> that controls the operation of the probe <b>1000</b> and the output of the display <b>2000</b>, and processes data.</p>
<p id="p-0051" num="0050"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref> is a diagram showing an example of the probe of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0052" num="0051">First, a configuration of the probe <b>1000</b> will be described with reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>1</b> and <b>2</b></figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0053" num="0052">The probe <b>1000</b> may include a channel signal processing unit <b>1100</b>, a notification unit <b>1300</b>, a first communication unit <b>1500</b>, a first control unit <b>1600</b>, and a body.</p>
<p id="p-0054" num="0053">N (N is a natural number of 1 or more) channel signal processing units <b>1100</b> may be arranged in the probe <b>1000</b>. Each of the channel signal processing units includes a light irradiation module <b>1120</b> for irradiating a breast with the incident light, a light collection module <b>1160</b> for collecting measurement values (hereinafter referred to as optical data) of information such as a wavelength of reflected light of the incident light irradiated to the breast (hereinafter referred to as the reflected light), and a driving chip.</p>
<p id="p-0055" num="0054">The light irradiation module <b>1120</b> may be configured to include an optical output device such as a laser diode (LD), a light emitting diode (LED), or a vertical cavity surface emitting laser (VCSEL), capable of outputting incident light having wavelengths of different lengths in the near infrared ray area.</p>
<p id="p-0056" num="0055">For example, the light irradiation module <b>1120</b> may be configured to output incident light classified into 8 types according to the length of the wavelength. In this case, if one light output device constituting the light irradiation module <b>1120</b> outputs light having 8 types of wavelengths, the light irradiation module <b>1120</b> may be configured of one light output device. In addition, if one light output device constituting the light irradiation module <b>1120</b> outputs light having 4 types of wavelengths, the light irradiation module <b>1120</b> may be configured of two light output devices each outputting light of different wavelengths.</p>
<p id="p-0057" num="0056">On the other hand, the number of types of incident light for each wavelength output by the light irradiation module <b>1120</b> may be determined based on the number of types of the chromophores present in the breast. Since the chromophores effectively absorb light having a wavelength of a specific length depending on their type, incident light having a wavelength that is effectively absorbed for each chromophore is irradiated to the breast and the reflected light is collected and analyzed, and thereby the concentration of each type of the chromophore may be measured.</p>
<p id="p-0058" num="0057">The light collection module <b>1160</b> may be configured to include a light collection device such as a photo diode, a photo transistor, a photo multiplier tube (PMT), or a photo cell capable of receiving light and collecting light data.</p>
<p id="p-0059" num="0058">Optical data of the reflected light collected by the light collection module <b>1160</b> may be transmitted to the central control device <b>3000</b> to calculate the concentration of the chromophore.</p>
<p id="p-0060" num="0059"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref> is a diagram showing the probe of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref> collecting optical data by coming into contact with a target object.</p>
<p id="p-0061" num="0060">Specifically, referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref>, the light irradiation module <b>1120</b> and the light collection module <b>1160</b> are installed on the probe <b>1000</b> so as to be exposed to a predetermined surface of the probe <b>1000</b>, and when the predetermined surface of the probe <b>1000</b> comes into contact with a light data collection target (hereinafter referred to as the target object) <b>10</b> such as the breast, the light irradiation module <b>1120</b> and the light collection module <b>1160</b> may come into contact with the target object <b>10</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0062" num="0061">Then, when the incident light irradiated from the light irradiation module <b>1120</b> is reflected inside the target object <b>10</b>, the light collection module <b>1160</b> may collect optical data of the reflected light. The optical data may include information about the wavelength and intensity of the reflected light, and the like.</p>
<p id="p-0063" num="0062"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b></figref> is a diagram showing another example of the probe of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0064" num="0063">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b></figref>, the probe <b>1000</b> may include one or more channel signal processing units <b>1100</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0065" num="0064">For example, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b></figref>, a plurality of channel signal processing units <b>1100</b> may be included in the probe <b>1000</b> so that a plurality of light irradiation modules <b>1120</b> and a plurality of light collection modules <b>1160</b> are exposed to the predetermined surface of the probe <b>1000</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0066" num="0065">For example, N channel signal processing units <b>1100</b> may be disposed in a horizontal direction along one axis of the probe <b>1000</b>, the light irradiation modules <b>1120</b> and the light collection module <b>1160</b> of the channel signal processing unit <b>1100</b> adjacent to each other may be disposed so as to be adjacent to each other, so that the light irradiation modules <b>1120</b> may be disposed in a row parallel to one axis thereof, and the light collection modules <b>1160</b> may be disposed in a row parallel to one axis thereof by being spaced apart from the light irradiation modules <b>1120</b> by predetermined distances. In this case, a penetration depth of the near-infrared rays may be adjusted by the separation distance between the light collection module <b>1160</b> and the light irradiation module <b>1120</b>, and accordingly, a measurement depth in the measurement target may be adjusted. For example, the penetration depth of near-infrared rays is about &#xbd; of the separation distance. Accordingly, an optimal measurement depth may be set by setting an appropriate separation distance between the light collection module <b>1160</b> and the light irradiation module <b>1120</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0067" num="0066">In other words, the distances between the light irradiation modules <b>1120</b> and the light collection modules <b>1160</b> included in each channel signal processing unit <b>1100</b> are the same, so that the plurality of light irradiation modules <b>1120</b> may be disposed in a row in a first direction on the predetermined surface, and the plurality of light collection modules <b>1160</b> may be disposed in a row in a second direction parallel to the first direction on the predetermined surface of the probe <b>1000</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0068" num="0067">As such, since the probe <b>1000</b> includes one or more channel signal processing units <b>1100</b>, when collecting the optical data by contacting the target object <b>10</b>, the probe <b>1000</b> may collect the optical data covering a wide area of the target object <b>10</b> with one contact.</p>
<p id="p-0069" num="0068">On the other hand, a disposition structure of the plurality of light irradiation modules <b>1120</b> and the light collection modules <b>1160</b> included in the plurality of channel signal processing units <b>1100</b> installed in the probe <b>1000</b> is not limited to the above-described disposition structure of light irradiation modules <b>1120</b> and the light collection modules <b>1160</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0070" num="0069">A driving chip <b>1180</b> in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b></figref> may sequentially output a driving signal for driving the light irradiation module <b>1120</b> according to a control signal of the first control unit <b>1600</b> which is described later, and transmit the optical data of the reflected light detected by the light collection module <b>1160</b> to the first control unit <b>1600</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0071" num="0070">In addition, the driving chip <b>1180</b> of each channel signal processing unit <b>1100</b> may sequentially output 4 to 12 driving signals so that light of 4 to 12 different wavelengths may be sequentially output from the light irradiation module <b>1120</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0072" num="0071">The notification unit <b>1300</b> may be installed on a housing outside the body of the probe <b>1000</b>, including a flickering LED and a liquid crystal display, and may perform a function of notifying a user of an operating state of the probe <b>1000</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0073" num="0072">For example, when the channel signal processing unit <b>1100</b> of the probe <b>1000</b> comes into contact with the breast and completes the collection of the optical data, the notification unit <b>1300</b> blinks the blinking LED or displays the information about the completion of the collection of the optical data on the liquid crystal display, so that the completion of the optical data collection of the probe <b>1000</b> may be notified to the user.</p>
<p id="p-0074" num="0073">The first communication unit <b>1500</b> may be configured of a conventional communication module capable of transmitting and receiving data with a device outside the probe <b>1000</b>, and may be configured to include a wireless communication module such as Wi-Fi or Bluetooth&#xae;.</p>
<p id="p-0075" num="0074">For example, in a case where the probe <b>1000</b> is configured to be wirelessly connected to the central control device <b>3000</b>, control data related to the operation of the probe <b>1000</b> transmitted from the central control device <b>3000</b> may be received through the first communication unit <b>1500</b>. In addition, the optical data of the breast collected by the probe <b>1000</b> may be transmitted to the central control device <b>3000</b> through the first communication unit <b>1500</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0076" num="0075">The first control unit <b>1600</b> may control the operations of the channel signal processing unit <b>1100</b>, the notification unit <b>1300</b>, and the first communication unit <b>1500</b>, and may be implemented as a device capable of processing data such as a processor. Here, the processor may mean, for example, a data processing device built in hardware having a physically structured circuit to perform functions expressed by codes or instructions included in a program. An example of such a data processing device built in hardware may include a microprocessor, a central processing unit (CPU), a processor core, a multiprocessor, an application-specific integrated circuit (ASIC), a field programmable gate array (FPGA), or the like, but the scope of the present disclosure is not limited thereto.</p>
<p id="p-0077" num="0076">In addition, the first control unit <b>1600</b> may further include a first decoder <b>1620</b> and a second decoder <b>1660</b> that transmit and receive data to and from the driving chip <b>1180</b> of the channel signal processing unit <b>1100</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0078" num="0077"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b></figref> is a diagram showing the first decoder and the second decoder of the first control unit that transmit and receive data to and from the driving chip <b>1180</b> of the channel signal processing unit.</p>
<p id="p-0079" num="0078">On the other hand, referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b></figref>, the first control unit <b>1600</b> may include the first decoder <b>1620</b> that sequentially transfers control signals for operating the driving chips <b>1180</b> of each channel signal processing unit and the second decoder <b>1660</b> that sequentially receives and outputs the optical data of the reflected light output from each driving chip <b>1180</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0080" num="0079">In addition, as receiving all the optical data of the reflected light corresponding to the unit scan which is described later through each channel signal processing unit <b>1100</b>, the first control unit <b>1600</b> may transmit the control signal to cause the notification unit <b>1300</b> such as a blinking LED or a liquid crystal display to display the completion of the unit scan.</p>
<p id="p-0081" num="0080">The body may be configured of a housing capable of accommodating the channel signal processing unit <b>1100</b>, the notification unit <b>1300</b>, the first communication unit <b>1500</b>, and the first control unit <b>1600</b> therein, and a contact surface thereof may be disposed on a lower surface. The light irradiation module <b>1120</b> and the light collection module <b>1160</b> may be disposed to be exposed to the outside through an opening formed on the contact surface.</p>
<p id="p-0082" num="0081">Next, the configuration of the display <b>2000</b> will be described.</p>
<p id="p-0083" num="0082">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>, the display <b>2000</b> may include a display unit <b>2100</b> and a second communication unit <b>2300</b>.</p>

<p id="p-0086" num="0085">For example, in a case where the display <b>2000</b> is configured to be wirelessly connected to the central control device <b>3000</b>, the image data or the like transmitted from the central control device <b>3000</b> may be received through the second communication unit <b>2300</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0087" num="0086">In addition, the display <b>2000</b> may further include a touch input module, and accordingly, operations of various interfaces displayed on the display <b>2000</b> may be controlled, and operation control of the central control device <b>3000</b> may be performed therethrough.</p>
<p id="p-0088" num="0087">Next, the configuration of the central control device <b>3000</b> will be described.</p>
<p id="p-0089" num="0088">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>, the central control device <b>3000</b> may include a data processing unit <b>3100</b> that calculates and processes data, a second control unit <b>3300</b> that controls the operations of the probe <b>1000</b> and a display <b>2000</b>, and a third communication unit <b>3500</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0090" num="0089">The central control device <b>3000</b> performs operations of controlling the operation of the probe, receiving the optical data of the reflected light sensed by the probe, calculating the concentration of the chromophore of the target object for each chromophore based on the optical data, and generating the image of the chromophore indicating the distribution of concentration values of the chromophore, and may include a memory in which a program for performing such operations built, and various processors for executing the program.</p>
<p id="p-0091" num="0090">The memory may perform a function of temporarily or permanently storing data processed by the processor. Here, the memory may include volatile storage media or non-volatile storage media, but the scope of the present disclosure is not limited thereto.</p>
<p id="p-0092" num="0091">The processor executes a program, and may refer to, for example, a data processing device built in hardware having a physically structured circuit to perform functions expressed by codes or instructions included in the program. An example of such a data processing device built in hardware may include all processing devices such as a microprocessor, a central processing unit (CPU), a processor core, a multiprocessor, an application-specific integrated circuit (ASIC), and a field programmable gate array (FPGA), but the scope of the present disclosure is not limited thereto.</p>
<p id="p-0093" num="0092"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>6</b></figref> is a block diagram showing the data processing unit of the central control device of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0094" num="0093">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>6</b></figref>, the data processing unit <b>3100</b> includes a calculation module <b>3120</b> that calculates data on the concentration of the chromophore based on the optical data transmitted from the probe <b>1000</b>, and a generation module <b>3160</b> that generates an image of the chromophore indicating the distribution of concentration values of the chromophores based on the calculated concentration of the chromophore.</p>
<p id="p-0095" num="0094">The calculation module <b>3120</b> may receive the optical data (hereinafter, referred to as unit scan data) collected by each channel signal processing unit <b>1100</b> and calculate the concentration of the chromophore based on each unit scan data. The unit scan data may include measurement values of the reflected light reflected based on a plurality of different wavelengths of light output from the light irradiation module <b>1120</b> of each channel signal processing unit <b>1100</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0096" num="0095">For example, the calculation module <b>3120</b> may calculate the concentration of the chromophore using a machine-learned learning model (hereinafter, referred to as a learning model).</p>
<p id="p-0097" num="0096">The learning model may be learned based on training data including information about incident light having a wavelength of a specific length, information about the optical data of the reflected light collected as the incident light having a wavelength of a specific length is irradiated to the breast, and information about the concentration of the chromophore corresponding to the information about the collected optical data.</p>
<p id="p-0098" num="0097">Specifically, the training data is obtained by matching a measurement value for each wavelength of the reflected light with the concentration of each of a plurality of chromophore materials. For example, in a case where the incident light of the first to eighth wavelengths is sequentially incident, measurement values of the reflected light (for example, intensity of light) are measured from a1 to a8, and concentrations b1 to bn of individual chromophore material may be calculated based on the measurement values at this time, according to a known chromophore calculation equation. In this case, since the method for calculating the concentration of the chromophore included in a turbid medium by measuring the absorption coefficient and the scattering coefficient of the turbid medium in the near-infrared area corresponds to that of the prior art, a detailed description thereof will be omitted.</p>
<p id="p-0099" num="0098">For example, in the present disclosure, when the concentrations of 4 chromophore materials such as water (H2O), lipid, oxy-hemoglobin (O2Hb), and deoxy-hemoglobin (HHb) are calculated based on 8 measurement values of reflected light, the concentrations b1, b2, b3, and b4 of each chromophore calculated for each of the measurement values a1 to a8 of the light data of the reflected light may be labeled and used as the learning data. The learning model may be built through a process of collecting a plurality of such learning data and applying them to a machine learning algorithm.</p>
<p id="p-0100" num="0099">When specific optical data collected by irradiating the incident light having a specific wavelength is input to the machine-learned learning model based on such training data, the information about the input incident light and optical data may be compared with the corresponding training data to calculate the concentration of a specific chromophore of the breast.</p>
<p id="p-0101" num="0100">On the other hand, the collected optical data may be input to the learning model after being calibrated by using a calibration value.</p>
<p id="p-0102" num="0101">For example, the calibration value may be a value obtained by dividing a theoretical measurement value of the light data of the reflected light collected by irradiating the incident light on the target (hereinafter referred to as a reference target) that is a standard for measuring the calibration value with the light irradiation module <b>1120</b> by a measurement value of the optical data of the reflected light collected by actually irradiating the incident light on the reference target with the light irradiation module <b>1120</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0103" num="0102">In addition, the collected optical data may be calibrated by multiplying the measurement value of the optical data of the reflected light collected by the light collection module <b>1160</b> by irradiating incident light on the breast with the light irradiation module <b>1120</b> by the calibration value.</p>
<p id="p-0104" num="0103">As described above, when the calibrated optical data is input to the learning model, the concentration of the chromophore may be calculated.</p>
<p id="p-0105" num="0104">The generation module <b>3160</b> may generate the chromophore image including information about an image in which at least one of color, brightness, and chroma differs according to the concentration of the chromophore.</p>
<p id="p-0106" num="0105">For example, the generation module <b>3160</b> may generate the chromophore image in which each concentration of the chromophore calculated based on each unit scan data may be displayed as an individual image (hereinafter referred to as a unit frame image) on two-dimensional coordinates.</p>
<p id="p-0107" num="0106">In addition, the generation module <b>3160</b> may generate data about an image (hereinafter referred to as image data) using a conventional interpolation algorithm. As the interpolation algorithm, linear interpolation, bilinear interpolation, cubic interpolation, bicubic interpolation, or the like may be used.</p>
<p id="p-0108" num="0107">For example, in a case where a chromophore image having a first chroma for a first position of the breast and a chromophore image having a second chroma for a second position of the breast are generated, estimated image data (hereinafter, referred to as estimated image data) may be generated by using the interpolation algorithm so that image data having an average chroma of the first and second chromas corresponds to an intermediate position of the first position and the second position.</p>
<p id="p-0109" num="0108">The second control unit <b>3300</b> may control the operation of the probe <b>1000</b> by transmitting control data for controlling the operation of the probe <b>1000</b> to the probe <b>1000</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0110" num="0109">Specifically, the second control unit <b>3300</b> may control the operations of the light irradiation module <b>1120</b> of the channel signal processing unit <b>1100</b> and the notification unit <b>1300</b> of the probe <b>1000</b>, and the probe <b>1000</b> may transmit optical data to the central control device <b>3000</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0111" num="0110">For example, the second control unit <b>3300</b> may control blinking of the incident light output from the light irradiation module <b>1120</b> so that the probe <b>1000</b> may irradiate the incident light to the breast or stop irradiating the incident light, and control the intensity and wavelength length of the incident light output from the light irradiation module <b>1120</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0112" num="0111">In addition, in a case where the probe <b>1000</b> includes a plurality of channel signal processing units <b>1100</b>, the second control unit <b>3300</b> may control the irradiation order of the incident light so that the incident light may be irradiated in a free order or sequentially from the plurality of light irradiation modules <b>1120</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0113" num="0112">As another example, when the probe <b>1000</b> comes into contact with the breast and all of the plurality of channel signal processing units <b>1100</b> complete the collection of the optical data, the second control unit <b>3300</b> may control the operation of the notification unit <b>1300</b> to allow the notification unit <b>1300</b> to perform the operation of notifying completion of collection of the optical data.</p>
<p id="p-0114" num="0113">As another example, the second control unit <b>3300</b> may control the probe <b>1000</b> to transmit the optical data collected by the probe <b>1000</b> to the central control device <b>3000</b> through the first communication unit <b>1500</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0115" num="0114">The second control unit <b>3300</b> may control the output of the display unit <b>2100</b> by transmitting the control data for controlling the operation of the display <b>2000</b> to the display <b>2000</b>.</p>
