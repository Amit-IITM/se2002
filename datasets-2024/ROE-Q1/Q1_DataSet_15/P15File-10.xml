<p id="p-0003" num="0002">The present disclosure relates to the field of medical and non-medical devices and/or systems that provide chest protection, especially for sports system. More specifically, the present disclosure relates to a compression chest protection system including a chest protection device and a belt. The compression chest protection system is related to a compression vest system disclosed herein by including some or several of the features of the compression vest system disclosed herein. According to certain aspects of the present disclosure, the compression vest system includes a vest and a belt that may be worn by a patient and exert forces on the patient that stabilize the vest in a position relative to the patient as grips attached to the vest and belt are used by a caregiver to aid or ensure the safety of a movement of the patient. Further, the belt may include stays that support and stabilize the patient's spine as the belt compresses a torso of the patient. In addition, at least one embodiment or aspect of a compression vest system and/or a compression chest protection system may comprise at least one of the following four additional features, along with some, most or all of the features of the embodiment(s) or aspect(s) of the present invention that do not include these four additional features: (1) at least one zipper expansion and retraction mechanism, such as, but not limited to, on the right side and/or on and left side of the vest and/or on the right side and/or on and left side of the vest, for allowing users of different body shapes and/or sizes to better fit inside the compression vest system during use; (2) Velcro, hook and loop system, and/or any known securing device, mechanism, or system known to one of ordinary skill in the art on the front and rear of the belt and on the belly button area of the vest to increase stabilization, decrease slippage of the belt from the vest, and increase security of the belt to the vest (especially during transfer or use); (3) at least one swivel hook, ring, attachment ring, and/or any known securing device, mechanism, or system known to one of ordinary skill in the art that are dependent on the type(s) of an individual's needs, sports, therapy, rehabilitation, and settings (as a non-limiting example, this third additional feature is positioned on the vest and belt (five: two on hip of each side of the belt and one on the back side of the belt) to the attachment point); and (4) a leg attachment device for detachably securing a compression vest system to a leg of a user for better stabilization of the compression vest system to the user during transfer or use. Preferably, an embodiment or aspect of a compression vest system comprises most or all of these four additional features.</p>
<heading id="h-0003" level="1">BACKGROUND</heading>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">Situations often arise that require a caregiver to aid a movement of a patient by lifting, guiding, catching, and/or supporting a weight of the patient. The caregiver may be a physical therapist, medical professional, first responder, family member, etc., and the patient may be a person that is injured, is rehabilitating, is elderly, or has limited or no mobility due to a previous injury or terminal illness such as ALS or cerebral palsy. The act of aiding the patient's movement, also know as transferring the patient, involves inherent risks to both the caregiver and the patient.</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">The caregiver may attempt to handle the patient via a body part of, or clothing worn by, the patient. However, either of these methods can readily lead to the caregiver losing grasp of the patient. In attempting to maintain an original grasp, the caregiver may strain his or her muscles to the point of injury. Additionally, with respect to grasping clothing worn by the patient, it is not uncommon, and in fact should be expected, for the clothing, specifically a location where the clothing is being grasped, to shift positions relative to the patient. The new location of grasping relative to the patient could place either of the caregiver and the patient in an awkward position, or pressure being applied to a sensitive area of a respective person. Generally, this could cause either or both of the caregiver and the patient to experience discomfort, and/or shift a supported load in such a way that muscles or bones of the caregiver or the patient that support the load are loaded or strained to the point of failure and cause injury.</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">Often times patients are obese or generally of greater size than caregivers such as nurses or physical therapists. Further, some patients may have limited mobility in their arms, hips, and/or legs. Either of these conditions (weight/size disparity or patient mobility) alone, but especially in combination, may cause the patient and/or the caregiver attempting to handle the patient to be in an awkward position and/or support a load that the patient or caregiver is not strong enough to support. Further, trying to re-grasp or catch a patient that is falling is difficult where only a part of the patient's body or a loose piece of clothing is available. These and the other risks discussed herein generally place the caregiver at risk for losing a grasp of and dropping the patient. Just as if the patient fell while doing an activity independent of any aid, dropping the patient may cause the patient to sustain significant injuries. Likewise, in trying to avoid dropping the patient, the caregiver may strain his or her muscles or load his or her bones to the point of injury.</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">Further, it is often the case that the patient has difficulty maintaining an upright position due to their condition which includes a spine that is functionally inhibited, has a structural irregularity, or is poorly or otherwise insufficiently supported by weak muscles. The patient's spine may persistently exhibit an unnatural curvature, which may only be exacerbated during independent or guided movement by the patient. This can result in further injury to the patient during transfers, as it is difficult for the caregiver to maintain the patient in a safe position. It is not uncommon for caregivers recognizing these conditions to attempt to correct the patient's posture before a transfer, or make impromptu attempts to support and correct the patient's posture during transfers. Such attempts during transfers may involve quickly grasping other parts of the patient's body or other pieces of clothing than originally planned. This can lead to the patient and/or caregiver moving into awkward positions and undue stress being place on the body of the caregiver and/or patient. Accordingly, a lack of spinal stability in the patient can result in further injuries to the caregiver and the patient when moving or guiding the movement of the patient.</p>

<heading id="h-0006" level="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION</heading>
<p id="p-0130" num="0129">Aspects of the disclosure will now be described in detail with reference to the figures, wherein like reference numbers refer to like elements throughout, unless specified otherwise. Recitation of ranges of values herein are merely intended to serve as a shorthand method of referring individually to each separate value falling within the range, unless otherwise indicated herein, and each separate value is incorporated into the specification as if it were individually recited herein. All methods described herein can be performed in any suitable order unless otherwise indicated herein or otherwise clearly contradicted by context.</p>
<p id="p-0131" num="0130">Aspects of the present disclosure described herein are directed toward a compression vest system that includes a vest and a belt. The vest may include a back panel, a first panel that may extend from the back panel and define a first arm access, and a second panel that may extend from the back panel and define a second arm access opposite to the first arm access. A body of the vest may be defined by those portions of the back, first, and second panels that extend from a lower end of the vest to an axis passing through a lower end of each of the first and second arm access. The first panel may include a first flap that overlaps a second flap of the second panel in a closed state of the vest.</p>
<p id="p-0132" num="0131">An interior surface of the first flap may include a first front attachment segment that is configured to attach to a second front attachment segment provided on an exterior surface of the second flap, such that the first and second flaps define a closure of the vest. A configuration of portions of the first front attachment segment configured to mirror and attach to portions of the second front attachment segment (or vice versa) in a closed state of the vest may define an attachment configuration of the closure. An area of a fully implemented attachment configuration may be sized relative to an area defined by a length and width of the body such that when the vest is fittingly worn by an individual, the vest: (1) may exert first compressive forces on the body of the individual; and (2) remain stationary relative to a respective position on the individual in response to an external force being applied to the vest.</p>
<p id="p-0133" num="0132">The belt may include a pair of flanks, a pair of elastic tension bands, and a belt attachment segment configured to attach to a back attachment segment provided on the back panel of the vest. The belt may be attached to the vest and form-fittingly wrapped around the vest being worn by the patient and exert second compressive force on a torso of the patient. The elastic tension bands may be extended in opposite directions beyond normal state lengths and attached to belt attachment segments provided on respective flanks to increase the second compressive forces exerted on the patient.</p>
<p id="p-0134" num="0133">A plurality of inelastic grips may be attached to exterior surfaces of the back, first, and second panels of the vest, as well as an exterior surface of the belt. The grips may allow a caregiver, regardless of size relative to a patient, to select a combination of grips to maximize a degree of leverage the caregiver is capable of comfortably and safely implementing relative to the patient, to aid a movement of the patient. Further, the grips may be relied on to provide a constant grip and minimize a risk of the caregiver having to re-grip, or dropping the patient. During the use of the grips as discussed, the first and second compressive forces exerted on the patient via implementations of the closure and the belt, ensures the vest remains in a position (stationary position) relative to the patient that, inter alia: (A) allows the caregiver to continue to safely move or guide the patient; and (B) minimize any discomfort to the patient that may result from the vest bunching up or moving to touch various body parts like a neck of the patient.</p>
<p id="p-0135" num="0134">In addition, aspects of the present disclosure described herein are directed toward a compression vest system that includes a vest, a belt, and at least one stay. The vest may include a back panel, a first panel that may extend from the back panel and define a first arm access, and a second panel that may extend from the back panel and define a second arm access opposite to the first arm access. A body of the vest may be defined by those portions of the back, first, and second panels that extend from a lower end of the vest to an axis passing through a lower end of each of the first and second arm access. The first panel may include a first flap that overlaps a second flap of the second panel in a closed state of the vest.</p>
<p id="p-0136" num="0135"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b>A</figref> illustrates a caregiver <b>10</b> aiding a movement of a patient <b>20</b>. As illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b>A</figref>, the caregiver <b>10</b> is smaller than the patient <b>20</b>, and is required to directly support a substantial weight of the patient <b>20</b> in order to move the patient <b>20</b> from a bed <b>30</b>. In addition, the caregiver <b>10</b> must directly handle (e.g. grab) the patient <b>20</b>. One of ordinary skill in the art will recognize that as a consequence of the caregiver <b>10</b> supporting the load generated by the weight of the patient <b>20</b>, the caregiver <b>10</b> will experience various magnitudes of stress in a variety of muscles and bones, for example in the areas of the back, knees, elbows, and/or wrists. Accordingly, the caregiver <b>10</b> may be at risk of sustaining an injury to one or more of these areas.</p>
<p id="p-0137" num="0136">In addition, handling the patient <b>20</b> directly may involve holding on to a body part of the patient <b>20</b> or a piece of clothing the patient <b>20</b> is wearing. It follows that the caregiver <b>10</b> may be at risk of losing their respective grasp of the patient <b>20</b> and be forced to re-grip and/or adjust a hand placement. The attendant risk in such a maneuver, which could occur in the situation illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b>A</figref>, is that the new hand placement may cause the caregiver <b>10</b> to support the patient <b>20</b> in an uncomfortable and unorthodox manner exposing both to injury, or be ineffective and lead to patient <b>20</b> being dropped.</p>
<p id="p-0138" num="0137"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b>B</figref> illustrates the caregiver <b>10</b> aiding a movement of the patient <b>20</b> utilizing a compression vest system <b>100</b>, according to an aspect of the present disclosure. The compression vest system <b>100</b> includes a vest <b>200</b>, which is described in more detail with reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>2</b>A-<b>11</b></figref>, and a belt <b>1200</b>, which is described in more detail with reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>12</b>A-C</figref>. In a normal implementation of the compression vest system <b>100</b>, the compression vest system <b>100</b> may be worn by the patient <b>20</b> so as to apply radially compressive forces to the body (torso) of the patient <b>20</b> as explained in further detail herein. These compressive forces prevent the vest <b>200</b> from shifting relative to the patient <b>20</b> when external forces are applied to grips such as a first grip <b>218</b>, a body grip <b>280</b>, and/or a belt grip <b>1220</b> illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b>B</figref>, attached to the vest <b>200</b> and/or the belt <b>1200</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0139" num="0138">One of ordinary skill in the art will recognize that at least relative to the clothing or body of the patient <b>20</b>, the compression vest system <b>100</b> provides the caregiver <b>10</b> with a more rigid and usable device for pulling, lifting, guiding, or generally moving the patient <b>20</b>. In particular, the vest compression system <b>100</b> incorporates grips that are substantially inelastic and rigidly attached to a garment (vest <b>200</b>) that remains stationary relative to the patient <b>20</b>. As a result, the caregiver <b>10</b>, irrespective of a size relative to the patient <b>20</b>, can select a combination of grips to use that: (A) will maximize a degree of leverage the caregiver <b>10</b> is capable of comfortably and safely implementing relative to the patient <b>20</b> to aid a movement thereof; and (B) can be relied on to provide a constant grip and minimize a risk of having to re-grip, or dropping the patient <b>20</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0140" num="0139">As defined herein a patient may be any individual requiring assistance to move in any manner, and a caregiver may be any individual attempting to aid the patient and need not be a medical professional such as a doctor, nurse, or physical therapist.</p>
<p id="p-0141" num="0140"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>2</b>A and <b>2</b>B</figref> illustrate front and rear perspective views of the vest <b>200</b> of the compression vest system <b>100</b>, according to an aspect of the present disclosure. The vest <b>200</b> includes a front region <b>202</b> and a back region <b>204</b>. The front region <b>202</b> is defined by a first panel <b>210</b> and a second panel <b>220</b>; both extending from a back panel <b>230</b> that defines the back region <b>204</b>. The vest <b>200</b> extends along a first longitudinal axis <b>206</b> from a lower end <b>208</b> thereof, and defines a head <b>250</b> and a body <b>252</b>. Further, the back panel <b>230</b> extends perpendicular to the first longitudinal axis <b>206</b> from the first panel <b>210</b> to the second panel <b>220</b>. According to an aspect of the present disclosure, the first panel <b>210</b> may be attached to the back panel via a first side seam <b>254</b><i>a </i>as illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b>B</figref>. The first side seam <b>254</b><i>a </i>may be provided between an outer edge <b>212</b> of the first panel <b>210</b> (&#x201c;first outer edge <b>212</b>&#x201d;), and a corresponding portion of a back outer edge <b>232</b> of the back panel <b>230</b>. Likewise, the second panel <b>220</b> may be attached to the back panel <b>230</b> via a second side seam <b>254</b><i>b </i>as illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b>A</figref>. The second side seam <b>254</b><i>b </i>may be provided between an outer edge <b>222</b> of the second panel <b>220</b> (&#x201c;second outer edge <b>222</b>&#x201d;) and a corresponding portion of the back outer edge <b>232</b>. The side seams <b>254</b><i>a</i>, <b>254</b><i>b </i>may extend parallel to the longitudinal axis <b>206</b> as illustrated, or angled relative to the longitudinal axis <b>206</b>. The side seams <b>254</b><i>a</i>, <b>254</b><i>b </i>may be constructed with stitching or reinforcement stitching.</p>
<p id="p-0142" num="0141">The first panel <b>210</b>, the second panel <b>220</b>, and the back panel <b>230</b> may be formed from the same material or different materials. According to an aspect of the present disclosure the first, second, and back panels <b>230</b> may be formed from a fabric material such as canvas. According to another aspect of the present disclosure, the first panel <b>210</b>, the second panel <b>220</b>, and the back panel <b>230</b> may be formed from fire retardant or water proof material. In addition, portions of interior and exterior surfaces of the vest <b>200</b> may be lined with cotton or fleece material to provide added comfort to a patient wearing or a caregiver touching the vest <b>200</b>. Further, portions of the first panel <b>210</b>, the second panel <b>220</b>, and the back panel <b>230</b> may be formed from elastic material.</p>
<p id="p-0143" num="0142">As illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>2</b>A and <b>2</b>B</figref>, the first panel <b>210</b> further includes a first upper edge <b>216</b> that is attached via a first upper seam <b>256</b><i>a </i>to a corresponding peripheral portion <b>234</b><i>b </i>of a back upper edge <b>234</b> of the back panel <b>230</b>. The second panel <b>220</b> includes a second upper edge <b>226</b> that is attached via a second upper seam <b>256</b><i>b </i>to a corresponding peripheral portion <b>234</b><i>b </i>of the back upper edge <b>234</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0144" num="0143">One of ordinary skill in the art will recognize that the first panel <b>210</b> and/or the second panel <b>220</b> may be formed as one piece with the back panel <b>230</b> in one or more of the areas corresponding to the side seams <b>254</b><i>a</i>, <b>254</b><i>b </i>and the upper seam <b>256</b><i>a</i>, <b>256</b><i>b</i>. Thus, according to an aspect of the present disclosure, any combination or all of the seams <b>254</b><i>a</i>, <b>254</b><i>b</i>, <b>260</b><i>a</i>, <b>256</b><i>b </i>discussed above may be obviated. However, in any of the configurations discussed herein, a portion of the first outer edge <b>212</b> will extend from the first upper edge <b>216</b> (or an area corresponding to the first upper edge <b>216</b>) to a location corresponding to a transition <b>258</b> between the head <b>250</b> and the body <b>252</b> of the vest <b>200</b> as identified in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>2</b>A and <b>2</b>B</figref>. This portion of the first outer edge <b>212</b> covered by a first outer lip <b>260</b>, along with a corresponding portion of the back outer edge <b>232</b> also covered by the first outer lip <b>260</b>, defines a first arm access <b>262</b>. Further, a portion of the second outer edge <b>222</b> will extend from the second upper edge <b>226</b> (or an area corresponding to the first upper edge <b>216</b>) to the transition <b>258</b>. This portion of the second outer edge <b>222</b> covered by a second outer lip <b>264</b>, along with a corresponding portion of the back outer edge <b>232</b> also covered by the second outer lip <b>264</b>, defines a second arm access <b>266</b>. It will be understood that the transition <b>258</b> coincides with an axis that passes through a lower end <b>262</b><i>a </i>of the first arm access <b>262</b> and a lower end <b>266</b><i>a </i>of the second arm access <b>266</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0145" num="0144">With respect to the first panel <b>210</b>, an exterior surface <b>210</b><i>a </i>of the first panel <b>210</b> (&#x201c;first exterior surface <b>210</b><i>a</i>&#x201d;) is opposite an interior surface of the first panel <b>210</b> (&#x201c;first interior surface <b>210</b><i>b</i>&#x201d;&#x2014;see <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b></figref>), and extends from the first outer edge <b>212</b> to a first inner edge <b>214</b>. The first inner edge <b>214</b> extends from the first upper edge <b>216</b> to the lower end <b>208</b> of the body <b>252</b>. In a closed state of the vest <b>200</b> illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b>A</figref>, the first panel <b>210</b> overlaps the second panel <b>220</b> and the first inner edge <b>214</b> extends across and down the second panel <b>220</b>. Accordingly, the first inner edge <b>214</b> defines a free edge of the front region <b>202</b>. Further with respect of the first panel <b>210</b>, a first front grip <b>218</b> is attached to the first panel <b>210</b> just below the first upper edge <b>216</b> and extends over a substantial portion of the head <b>250</b> of the vest <b>200</b>. One of ordinary skill in the art will recognize that the first front grip <b>218</b> may be provided in different lengths and cover different proportions of the head <b>250</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0146" num="0145">The first and second front grips <b>218</b>, <b>228</b> may be positioned as illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>2</b>A and <b>2</b>B</figref> so that a caregiver can easily access a grip as it will be positioned near or on the shoulders of a patient. Further, by positioning the first and second front grips <b>218</b>, <b>228</b> so as to be near to a head of the patient when the vest <b>200</b> is being worn, the patient's head will likely be in the caregiver's line of sight if the front grips <b>218</b>, <b>228</b> are used. Accordingly, the caregiver will be able to easily see how his or her manipulation of the front grips <b>218</b>, <b>228</b> to move/transfer the patient affects a movement of the patient's head. As result, the caregiver may quickly adjust the manner in which the front grips <b>218</b>, <b>228</b> are being manipulated to minimize discomfort or the chance that the patient's neck will be subject to abrupt movements of the patient's head.</p>
<p id="p-0147" num="0146">With respect to the second panel <b>220</b>, an exterior surface <b>220</b><i>a </i>of the second panel <b>220</b> (&#x201c;second exterior surface <b>220</b><i>a</i>&#x201d;) is opposite an interior surface <b>220</b><i>b </i>of the second panel <b>220</b> (&#x201c;second interior surface <b>220</b><i>b</i>&#x201d;&#x2014;see <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>7</b></figref>), and extends from the second outer edge <b>222</b> to a second inner edge <b>224</b>. The second inner edge <b>224</b> extends from the second upper edge <b>226</b> to the lower end <b>208</b> of the body <b>252</b>. In a closed state of the vest <b>200</b> illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b>A</figref>, the first panel <b>210</b> overlaps the second panel <b>220</b>, and the first panel <b>210</b> covers a substantial portion of the second inner edge <b>224</b> extending over the body <b>252</b>. A second front grip <b>228</b> is attached to the second panel <b>220</b> just below the second upper edge <b>226</b> and extends over a substantial portion of the head <b>250</b> of the vest <b>200</b>. One of ordinary skill in the art will recognize that the second front grip <b>228</b> may be provided in different lengths and cover different proportions of the head <b>250</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0148" num="0147">As discussed above with respect to the back panel <b>230</b>, portions of the back outer edge <b>232</b> define the first arm access <b>262</b> and the second arm access <b>266</b>. In addition, a middle portion <b>234</b><i>a </i>of the back upper edge <b>234</b> is covered by an upper lip <b>268</b> and defines a collar <b>270</b> along with portions of the first inner edge <b>214</b> and the second inner edge <b>224</b> also covered by the upper lip <b>268</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0149" num="0148">The back panel <b>230</b> is defined by a back-exterior surface <b>232</b><i>a </i>illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>2</b>A and <b>2</b>B</figref>, and a back interior surface <b>232</b><i>b</i>, a portion of which being visible in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b>A</figref>. Further, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b>B</figref>, a set of first back grips <b>236</b> and a set of second back grips <b>238</b> are attached to the back-exterior surface <b>232</b><i>a</i>. The first back grips <b>236</b> extend laterally and the second back grips <b>238</b> extend vertically, and each set includes two grips. One first back grip <b>236</b> is positioned proximate to the back upper edge <b>234</b> and the other first back grip <b>236</b> is disposed at or below the transition <b>258</b> between the head <b>250</b> and the body <b>252</b>. Thus, the second back grips <b>238</b> and at least one of the first back grips <b>236</b> are attached to the back panel <b>230</b> within the head <b>250</b>. However, one of ordinary skill in the art will recognize that the first back grips <b>236</b> and the second back grips <b>238</b> may be positioned closer together or farther apart, in other orientations (for example the second back grips <b>238</b> may be angled in a V-shape or A-shape), and provided in different numbers per set (e.g. 3 or 4 per set). The back panel <b>230</b> also includes a first back attachment segment <b>240</b> and second back attachment segment <b>242</b> positioned below the transition <b>258</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0150" num="0149">As defined herein, an attachment segment includes a layer of interlocking material, such as hook and loop fastener material, that is capable of being fastened (e.g. stitched, glued, molded) to a surface of the vest <b>200</b> (i.e. a surface of the first, second, or back panel <b>210</b>, <b>220</b>, <b>230</b>) or the belt <b>1200</b>. A layer of interlocking material enabling a given panel on which it is fastened, to remain attached to another panel that includes a layer of interlocking material that positionally opposes the layer on the given panel. Alternatively, an attachment segment may be defined as a surface of the vest <b>200</b> or of the belt <b>1200</b> that is formed from (i.e. is itself a layer of) an interlocking material.</p>
<p id="p-0151" num="0150">It will be understood that an interlocking material may include any type of material provided on or as a given surface that, with respect to another surface provided with the same material or different material, is capable of: (A) remaining attached to the other surface without the aid of external force; and (B) being repeatedly detached from and reattached to the other surface. As discussed herein, a same material includes materials having corresponding components, as in the case of hook and loop fastener material wherein a layer component for a given surface includes hooks, and an opposing layer component for another surface includes loops.</p>

In such a configuration, the vest <b>200</b> may have multiple closed states for which: all of the separate first front attachment segments <b>402</b> are attached to some of the separate second front attachment segments <b>412</b>; or an entirety of the single first front attachment segment <b>402</b> is attached to a portion of the single second front attachment segment <b>412</b>. As a result, a size of a person that the vest <b>200</b> can accommodate may be different for each of the multiple closed states.

<p id="p-0166" num="0165">In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b></figref>, the closure region <b>302</b> and second longitudinal axis <b>304</b> are represented relative to each of the first flap <b>400</b> and the second flap <b>410</b>, for the purposes of explaining a relative total size of the area of the attachment configuration of the closure <b>300</b>. According to an aspect of the present disclosure, the first front attachment segment <b>402</b> may extend over an entirety of the first flap <b>400</b>, and the second front attachment segment <b>412</b> may span over an entirety of the second flap <b>410</b> as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b></figref>.

Likewise, at least an entirety of the second exterior surface <b>220</b><i>a </i>corresponding to the closure region <b>302</b> includes the second front attachment segment <b>412</b>. As a result, an area of the attachment configuration of the closure <b>300</b> illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b></figref> is greater than an area of the closure region <b>302</b>, and thus greater than a value of the body length I<sub>B </sub>multiplied by one fourth (&#xbc;) of the max body width w<sub>B-max </sub>(i.e., the area of the attachment configuration exceeds the value of (I<sub>B</sub>&#xd7;(&#xbc;)w<sub>B-max</sub>)).</p>
<p id="p-0167" num="0166">As discussed above with respect to the vest <b>200</b> illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>3</b> and <b>4</b></figref>, the area of the attachment configuration provided by the first and second front attachment segments <b>402</b>, <b>412</b> is greater than the area of the closure region <b>302</b> which is equal to:</p>

</p>
<p id="p-0171" num="0000">This minimum size of the area of the attachment configuration ensures that an implementation of the closure <b>300</b> results in the vest <b>200</b> remaining closed and stationary relative to a patient when any of the grips are utilized to lift, support, guide, catch, and/or move the patient.</p>
<p id="p-0172" num="0167">According to an aspect of the present disclosure, to place the vest <b>200</b> on a patient, for example, the vest <b>200</b> is opened by detaching the first flap <b>400</b> from the second flap <b>410</b> (thereby opening the closure <b>300</b>). More specifically, the first front attachment segment <b>402</b> is detached from the second front attachment segment <b>412</b>. Once positioned on the patient, the first panel <b>210</b> is positioned over (wrapped on to) the second panel <b>220</b> such that the first front attachment segment <b>402</b> is attached to the second front attachment segment <b>412</b>. In particular, the first panel <b>210</b> is preferably positioned so that the first front attachment segment <b>402</b> mirrors the second front attachment segment <b>412</b> and the attachment configuration of the closure <b>300</b> is fully implemented. Full implementation of the attachment arrangement ensures any potential movement of the vest <b>200</b> relative to a patient is substantially limited if not entirely prevented.</p>
<p id="p-0173" num="0168">A continuous attachment configuration, for example as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b></figref>, prevents the vest <b>200</b> from bunching up when grips <b>218</b>, <b>228</b>, <b>236</b>, <b>238</b>, <b>280</b> are being used as discussed herein. This may also be achieved with specific sizing and positioning of respective spaced apart segments of the first and second front attachment segments <b>402</b>, <b>412</b>, so as to meet the minimum area requirement for the attachment configuration discussed herein. For example, with reference to the vest <b>200</b> illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>3</b> and <b>4</b></figref>, each of first and second front attachment segments <b>402</b>, <b>412</b> of another exemplary attachment configuration according to the present disclosure may include separate attachment segments that are spaced apart along the second longitudinal axis <b>304</b>. More specifically, the separate attachment segments may be positioned at least in locations corresponding to top, middle, and bottom portions of the closure region <b>302</b>. Further, each of the separate attachment segments may extend perpendicular to the second longitudinal axis <b>304</b> continuously over an entire width of the closure region <b>302</b>. Thus, portions of the first and second front attachment segments <b>402</b>, <b>412</b> may be provided at least at the lower end <b>208</b>, the transition <b>258</b>, and an in location there between. According to an aspect of the present disclosure, locations for portions of the first and second front attachment segments <b>402</b>, <b>412</b> may be limited to being positioned within an area having a width equal to one fourth (&#xbc;) of the max body width w<sub>B-max</sub>.</p>
<p id="p-0174" num="0169">With reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref>, the second longitudinal axis <b>304</b> of the closure <b>300</b> and closure region <b>302</b> is offset from the first longitudinal axis <b>206</b> of the vest <b>200</b>. Thus, unlike a garment that opens and closes via a zipper or hook and loop fastening centered on the garment, the first flap <b>400</b> is wrapped or positioned past a center of the vest <b>200</b> to close the vest <b>200</b>. This is a result of a size (width) of the first panel <b>210</b> and provides a large area to grab a hold of when the vest <b>200</b> is being put on a patient. This larger area allows the patient or person putting vest <b>200</b> on the patient to obtain a firm grip of the first panel <b>210</b> and wrap the vest <b>200</b> tightly, and maximize a compressive effect of the vest <b>200</b>, on the patient. This in turn maximizes an ability of the vest <b>200</b> to remain stationary relative to the patient when the grips are used to lift, support, guide, catch, or move the patient.</p>
<p id="p-0175" num="0170">It will be understood that a location where a garment is closed, especially a form-fitting garment, corresponds to a locus of force or pressure that is continuously applied on an individual wearing the garment. With the offset configuration of the closure <b>300</b> of the vest <b>200</b> according to the present disclosure, a primary area where the vest <b>200</b> is closed does not coincide with a center of the patient's chest and stomach, and is not disposed in a centered manner directly below the patient's neck. For many patients these areas may be more sensitive than other parts of the body, and the offset configuration of the closure <b>300</b> may be more comfortable than centered configurations because the locus of force or pressure that is continuously applied to a patient by the closure <b>300</b> is distanced from these areas. In addition, in the rare case where the vest <b>200</b> may not remain stationary relative to the patient, the positioning of the closure <b>300</b> ensures that the patient will not be at risk of an inflexible object, such as a zipper or a middle portion of a hook and loop fastening that may include a total of four material layers, being pushed against the patient's neck.</p>
<p id="p-0176" num="0171">A resistance to opening due to a balance of forces is a further advantage of the exemplary offset configuration of the closure <b>300</b>. A location where a garment is closed, especially a form-fitting garment, also corresponds to a locus of force or pressure that is continuously applied on the garment by an individual wearing the garment. In a situation where a caregiver is supporting a patient's weight by holding on to, for example, opposite sides of the patient's garment, a direction (vector) of a force of patient's weight is likely to be aligned with and exerted in a direction corresponding to the center of the patient. Accordingly, the force of the patient's weight would be exerted directly on a centered closure, in addition to the continuous force already being exerted on the closure by the patient. According to the present disclosure, the closure <b>300</b> of the vest <b>200</b> is more proximate to where a force(s) may be applied to the second front grip <b>228</b> or closed body grip <b>280</b>, than a center of the vest <b>200</b>. Said force counteracts a force of a person's weight on the vest <b>200</b> that the closure <b>300</b> must be able to withstand for the vest <b>200</b> to remain closed. This, plus the condition of a force of the patient's weight being directly exerted on a location of the vest <b>200</b> that is offset from a substantial area of the closure <b>300</b> and offset from where the patient exerts a continuous force on the closure, reduces the force the closure <b>300</b> must withstand for the vest <b>200</b> to remain closed in comparison to a centered configuration. Thus, the offset configuration enhances an ability of the closure <b>300</b> to remain closed.</p>
<p id="p-0177" num="0172">According to an aspect of the present disclosure, the closure <b>300</b> and accompanying closure region may be orientated such that the second longitudinal axis <b>304</b> intersects the first longitudinal axis <b>206</b>. In particular, a point of intersection may be at location corresponding to a bottom point of the collar <b>270</b> or a point along the lower end <b>208</b> of the vest. In such a configuration, the first inner edge <b>214</b> may be angled so that a portion thereof below the transition extends parallel to the second longitudinal axis <b>304</b> intersects. In such a configuration, the length of the closure region <b>302</b> for the purposes of providing an attachment configuration of the first and second front attachment segments <b>402</b>, <b>412</b> according to the minimum area defined herein extends along the second longitudinal axis <b>304</b>. According to another aspect of the present disclosure, the vest <b>200</b> may include a front region that may be defined a continuous panel similar to the back panel <b>230</b> of the vest <b>200</b> illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>2</b>-<b>4</b></figref>, and a back region may be defined by a first panel and a second back that define a closure similar to the closure <b>300</b>.</p>

As illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>7</b></figref>, the segment stitching <b>350</b> for the second front attachment segment <b>412</b> may pass through and be visible on the second interior surface <b>220</b><i>b. </i></p>
<p id="p-0181" num="0176">Patterns of the segment stitching <b>350</b> used to secure the first and second front attachment segments <b>402</b>, <b>412</b> respectively to the first interior surface <b>210</b><i>b </i>and the second exterior surface <b>220</b><i>a </i>are illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>3</b>-<b>7</b></figref>. As discussed above, these patterns may follow the outer edges of a respective attachment segment as well as fully traverse a respective width thereof at several locations along the second longitudinal axis <b>304</b> as represented in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b></figref>. A pattern of the segment stitching <b>350</b> for the first front attachment segment <b>402</b> may substantially mirror the pattern for the segment stitching <b>350</b> for the second front attachment segment <b>412</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0182" num="0177">However, one of ordinary skill in the art will recognize that other stitching patterns (e.g. outer edges plus crossing patterns, more lines extending along a length direction, crossing patterns along the length direction, etc.) may be utilized to ensure an integrity of the attachments between the first and second panels <b>210</b>, <b>220</b> and the first and second front attachment segments <b>402</b>, <b>412</b> is maintained through each of a multitude of uses of the vest <b>200</b>. Further, it will be understood that a pattern for the first front attachment segment <b>402</b> may be different than a pattern utilized to secure the second front attachment segment. According to an aspect of the present disclosure, other types of stitching or fastening arrangements that do not require a stitching or other fastening material to entirely pass through portions of the first or second panels <b>210</b>, <b>220</b> and/or the first and second front attachment segments <b>410</b>, <b>412</b>, may be utilized.</p>
<p id="p-0183" num="0178"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>8</b></figref> illustrates an enlarged portion of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref>, identified as Detail <b>8</b>. In particular, the first front grip <b>218</b> and respective grip attachments <b>800</b> are shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>8</b></figref>. Each of the grips discussed herein includes at least two grip attachments <b>800</b> of the type illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>8</b> and <b>9</b></figref>, and a grip body <b>802</b> extending between the grip attachments. Each grip attachment <b>800</b> includes an end <b>800</b><i>a </i>of a respective grip (&#x201c;grip end <b>800</b><i>a</i>&#x201d;), in this case first front grip <b>218</b>, and grip stitching <b>800</b><i>b</i>. As illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>8</b></figref>, an upper grip end <b>800</b><i>a </i>of the first front grip <b>218</b> is attached to the first exterior surface <b>210</b><i>a </i>in a position below the first upper edge <b>216</b> and between the first outer edge <b>212</b> inside of the first outer lip <b>260</b> and the first inner edge <b>214</b> inside of the upper lip <b>268</b>. A lower grip end <b>800</b><i>a </i>may be attached to the first exterior surface <b>210</b><i>a </i>at, above, or below the transition <b>258</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0184" num="0179">The grip stitching <b>800</b><i>b </i>may be different from the segment stitching <b>350</b> in that the grip stitching <b>800</b><i>b </i>encompasses one or more types of reinforcement stitching (e.g., backstitching, bartacking, triple stitching), such that there may be more stitches per inch than that of the segment stitching <b>350</b>. The increased stitches per inch provides a more secure attachment between, in this case, the first front grip <b>218</b> and the vest <b>200</b>, because the greatest magnitude of force will be applied to the grips during a usage of the compression vest system <b>100</b> in, for example, the implementation illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b>B</figref>. Accordingly, locations where the grips are attached to the vest <b>200</b> or the belt <b>1200</b> will be subject to more strain and could become potential points of failure, and therefore must be secured to a heightened degree.</p>
<p id="p-0185" num="0180">It will be understood that the segment stitching <b>350</b> may also constitute reinforcement stitching. However, whereas a level of securement (strength of attachment) provided by this type of stitching may correspond to a maximum attachment strength for an attachment segment, it is a minimum threshold for attachment strength associated with a grip according the present disclosure. More generally, each grip of the compression vest system <b>100</b> will be attached to a respective component of the system (vest <b>200</b>, belt <b>1200</b>) by a stitching that provides at least the same level of securement as provided by reinforcement stitching.</p>
<p id="p-0186" num="0181">In addition to the grip attachments <b>800</b>, each of the grips discussed herein may have a grip body <b>802</b> that is separated from a surface of the vest over which it traverses and defines a component of the grip that may be grasped by a patient or caregiver.</p>

The second front grip <b>228</b> has substantially the same construction as the first front <b>218</b>. Like the first front grip <b>218</b>, the grip ends <b>800</b><i>a </i>of the second front grip <b>228</b> are attached to the second exterior surface <b>220</b><i>b </i>by grip stitching <b>800</b><i>b</i>. More specifically, an upper grip end <b>800</b><i>a </i>of the second front grip <b>228</b> is attached by grip stitching <b>800</b><i>b </i>to the second exterior surface <b>220</b><i>a </i>in a position below the second upper edge <b>226</b> and between the second outer edge <b>222</b> inside of the second outer lip <b>264</b> and the second inner edge <b>224</b> inside of the upper lip <b>268</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0189" num="0184">A difference between the first front grip <b>218</b> and the second front grip <b>228</b> is that for a given configuration of the closure <b>300</b>, the second front attachment segment <b>412</b> may extend above the transition <b>258</b>, and a lower grip end <b>800</b><i>a </i>of the second front grip <b>228</b> may be attached to the first exterior surface <b>210</b><i>a </i>at or below the transition <b>258</b>. Thus, the lower grip end <b>800</b> of the second front grip <b>228</b> may be covered by the second front attachment segment <b>412</b>. A portion of the second front attachment segment <b>228</b> covering the lower grip attachment <b>800</b> is cut away in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>10</b></figref> so that the lower grip attachment <b>800</b> is visible. As a result, a portion of an upper edge of the second front attachment segment <b>228</b> (where the second front attachment segment <b>412</b> is provided as a layer) may be attached to the second front grip <b>228</b> via segment stitching <b>350</b>, or to the second panel <b>220</b> and the second front grip <b>228</b> via double segment stitching <b>450</b>. Alternatively, the second front attachment segment <b>412</b> may have a cutout section to accommodate the lower grip end <b>800</b><i>a </i>of the second front grip <b>228</b>, and the lower grip end <b>800</b><i>a </i>may include a respective attachment segment secured thereto or formed as a part thereof.</p>

In general, a sagittal body plane divides a body into right and left parts, which may be unequal where the plane analyzed is offset from the midline of the body. Where an analyzed sagittal plane is offset to the left or right from the midline, but closer to the midline than an outer edge of the plane (i.e., side of a body in question), it is considered a medial plane. Conversely, where the analyzed plane is closer to the edge of the plane than the midline it is considered a lateral plane. The coronal plane <b>1360</b> divides the body into anterior (front or ventral) and posterior (back or dorsal) parts. Finally, the transverse plane <b>1380</b> runs horizontally and divides the body into superior (upper/top) and inferior (lower) parts.</p>
<p id="p-0202" num="0197">Anatomically, a trunk (or torso) for an individual includes their chest, abdomen, and back (including the spine). Trunk control refers an individual's ability to hold their torso upright, and control movement to and from that upright position. Thus, trunk control corresponds to an ability to control the movement of one's torso within the sagittal and coronal planes <b>1340</b>, <b>1360</b>. More particularly, trunk control can be described as an ability to hold a center of one's trunk coincident with a line of intersection between the coronal plane <b>1360</b> and the median sagittal plane (sagittal plane <b>1340</b> in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>13</b>C</figref>).</p>
<p id="p-0203" num="0198">Posture refers to the natural curves&#x2014;cervical, thoracic, and lumbar&#x2014;present in an individual's spine. An individual's posture is a reflection of the respective state of strength and flexibility in that individual's muscles and joints associated with their spine, hip, and legs. Alignment refers to how the head, shoulders, spine, hips, knees and ankles relate and line up with each other. As one of ordinary skill would readily understand, hip, knee, and ankle joints balance the natural curves of an individual's spine as the individual moves. Proper alignment of the body may reduce stress on the spine and help an individual maintain beneficial posture. Concurrently, an upright posture enables an individual to more easily maintain proper alignment.</p>
<p id="p-0204" num="0199">When proper alignment and beneficial posture is achieved, improved muscle function may result, because muscles have to do less work, or work together more efficiently, to accomplish given movements. A holistic effect of reduced stress on muscles during normal movements may contribute to better optimizing motor control of muscles being used, and autonomic functioning of an individual's nervous system. A more specific benefit with respect to the muscles and joints associated with the spine, hip, and legs, is improved trunk control. Conversely, issues related to the spine giving rise to poor posture and alignment inhibit an individual's ability to exercise trunk control.</p>
<p id="p-0205" num="0200">The first compressive forces <b>1300</b> applied by the vest <b>200</b> supplement a core strength of the patient <b>20</b> and increase the patient's ability to exercise trunk control. More specifically, by applying the first compressive forces <b>1300</b> (with or without the belt <b>1200</b>), the vest <b>200</b> limits movement of a spine of the patient <b>20</b> in the sagittal plane <b>1340</b> and the coronal plane <b>1360</b>. Thus, in straightening the spine of the patient <b>20</b>, the vest <b>200</b> by itself, provides general spinal support and stability within two of the three body planes, and can promote improved posture. In addition, alignment between trunk and hips of the patient <b>20</b> may be improved. This may allow certain muscle groups in the legs and hips of the patient to work together at the same time, and thereby improve overall muscle function. For example, where the trunk and hips are in alignment, muscles in the hips and legs can fire together at the same time as the patient <b>20</b> moves from a sitting to a standing position. This lessens the burden on the muscles around the spine to maintain the trunk from shifting to the left or to right of the sagittal plane <b>1340</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0206" num="0201">As the second compressive forces <b>1302</b> are directed radially inward similar to the first compressive forces <b>1300</b>, adding the belt <b>1200</b> enhances the spinal support and stability provided by the vest <b>200</b> within, and relative to the intersection of, the sagittal and coronal planes <b>1340</b>, <b>1360</b>. More significantly, where the belt <b>1200</b> is attached to first back attachment segment <b>240</b>, the second compressive forces <b>1302</b> are applied in a lumbar region of the spine of the patient <b>200</b>. This has the effect of locking a trunk and hips of the patient <b>20</b> relative to each other and the transverse plane <b>1380</b>. With the trunk and hips locked in place in proper (or at least improved) spatial alignment relative to the transvers plane <b>1380</b>, movement and motor control of the muscles in the hips and lower back occur in a natural (or least less inhibited) manner for an individual for which movements involving these muscles are problematic.</p>
<p id="p-0207" num="0202">Another benefit of the compression vest system <b>100</b> is that continued use may result in strengthening and, in effect, retraining of muscles in the trunk, hips, and legs involved in the movements for which functions of those muscles are improved by the system <b>100</b>. Further, as the compression vest system <b>100</b> causes a trunk of a sitting individual to be in an upright position, the muscles around the individual's spine responsible for holding the torso in the upright position will be active to some degree and thereby passively strengthened. Accordingly, even a person wearing compression vest system <b>100</b> may be inactive, muscles associated with the spine may be passively strengthened resulting in improved spinal stability and trunk control. To this point, the compression vest system <b>100</b> can assist with active core isometrics and passive strengthening, while at the same time, assist with increasing a spine angle and posture to be more upright. This in turn can help with motor control, posture, and body alignment, which play important roles in breathing, speech, eating, and swallowing, among other important functions of the body.</p>

Where the elastic tension bands <b>2190</b> are in a tensile state, and the belt <b>2150</b> is thus in an active state, ends of the elastic tension bands <b>2190</b> attached to the belt <b>2150</b> are in a state of tension. In a situation where the compression vest system <b>2100</b> is used by a patient that has extended the elastic tension bands <b>2190</b> to a maximum length, substantial tensile forces may be exerted on attachment points between the elastic tension bands <b>2190</b> and the belt <b>2150</b>.</p>

As indicated by the undulations of the layers <b>2166</b> illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>21</b>A and <b>21</b>B</figref>, the stays <b>2170</b> can have thickness so as to cause the layers <b>2166</b> to bulge beyond a normal thickness of a primary portion of the belt <b>2150</b> to which grips and attachment segments are attached. In one example, a thickness, number, and configuration of the stays <b>2170</b> will be determined according to location and magnitude of loads on a sacral-lumbar area of a patient to be relieved. As explained in more detail with reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>22</b>A and <b>22</b>B</figref>, the combination of the vest <b>200</b> and the belt <b>2150</b>, with the segmented pouching <b>2160</b>, can provide a patient with targeted lower spinal support.</p>
<p id="p-0239" num="0234"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>22</b>A and <b>22</b>B</figref> illustrate front and rear perspective views of the compression vest system <b>2100</b>, according to an aspect of the present disclosure. In the configuration illustrated: (1) the first panel <b>210</b> is attached to the second panel <b>220</b> via the closure <b>300</b>; (2) the belt <b>2150</b> is attached to the vest <b>200</b> via the central belt attachment segment <b>2162</b> and the first back attachment segment <b>240</b>; and (3) the first and second flanks <b>2156</b>, <b>2158</b> are wrapped around a torso of the patient <b>20</b> such that the first belt attachment segment <b>2156</b> (not shown) is attached to the exterior belt attachment segment <b>2172</b> provided on the first flank <b>2156</b>. In addition, the elastic tension bands <b>2190</b> have been attached to the first and second flanks <b>2156</b>, <b>2158</b> so as to be in a state of tension. The first compressive force <b>1300</b> applied by the vest <b>200</b> provides general support to a patient's spine, especially with respect to opposing movement of a patient's spine in sagittal and coronal body planes.</p>
<p id="p-0240" num="0235">Adding the belt <b>2150</b> so as to be tightly or form-fittingly (with respect to a form of the patient <b>20</b>) wrapped around the vest <b>200</b> worn by the patient <b>20</b> will result in second compressive forces <b>1302</b> generally/broadly exerted on the lower torso of the patient <b>20</b>, particularly in a lumbar and sacral region. Further, the belt <b>2150</b>, even without the segmented pouch <b>2160</b>, generally assists in controlling movement of a patient's spine in the sagittal plane and supports the patient's lumbar/sacral region. Extending the elastic tension bands <b>2190</b> beyond normal state lengths and attaching them to the exterior belt attachment segments <b>2172</b> increases the second compressive forces <b>1302</b> exerted on the patient <b>20</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0241" num="0236">The first and second compressive forces <b>1300</b>, <b>1302</b> counter act forces applied to the compression system <b>200</b> resulting from any of the first and second front, first and second back, body, and belt grips <b>218</b>, <b>228</b>, <b>236</b>, <b>238</b>, <b>280</b>, <b>2120</b> being pulled or pushed in any direction. As a result, the first and second compressive forces <b>1300</b>, <b>1302</b> act to: (A) support the spine in sagittal and coronal body planes; and (B) resist and eliminate, or at least substantially minimize a vertical displacement, a rotational displacement, and a front to back displacement of the vest <b>200</b> and the belt <b>2150</b> relative to the patient <b>20</b>. Further, the addition of the segmented pouch <b>2160</b> enables the compression vest system <b>2100</b> to provide targeted load relief to vertebrae in a patient's spine.</p>
<p id="p-0242" num="0237">Each stay <b>2170</b> in the segmented pouch <b>2160</b> can exert a compressive force over a respective portion of a lumbar and sacral spinal region of a patient. More specifically, with the elastic tension bands <b>2190</b> extending over the portion of the central strip <b>2155</b> including the segmented pouch <b>2160</b> and placed in tension, each stay <b>2170</b> in the segmented pouch <b>2160</b> applies an individual compressive force <b>2250</b> on a respective first pocket layer <b>2166</b>A of the belt <b>2150</b>, which is transmitted over a corresponding area of the back panel <b>230</b> of the vest <b>200</b>. In the case of the belt <b>2150</b>, the individual compressive forces <b>2250</b> are directed to a posterior of the patient in the lumbar and sacral portions of the patient's spine.</p>
<p id="p-0243" num="0238">A cumulative effect of the individual compressive forces <b>2250</b> applied over a total surface area of a corresponding region of the vest <b>200</b>, and thereby the patient, may produce intracavitary pressure that reduces load on intervertebral discs. As a result, a degree of reduction in load on the intervertebral discs in an area of the spine between the first (&#x201c;L-1&#x201d;) and just below the fifth vertebrae (&#x201c;L-5&#x201d;) of the lumbar spine, may be achieved. Such a reduction may be proportional to a cumulative magnitude of the individual compressive forces <b>2250</b> applied by the stays <b>2170</b> of the belt <b>2150</b>. Accordingly, a patient utilizing the compression vest system <b>2100</b> may experience a substantial improvement in stability in their lumbar spine.</p>

The vents <b>2186</b> may be sized to have a desired width in order to provided a desired degree of overall extension for the belt <b>2150</b>. In one example, the vent <b>2186</b> may be sized to accommodate a piece of equipment that a patient may have to use or wear to some degree of regularity, but not all of the time. In another example, where the patient may be expected to grow a certain amount in a predictable amount of time, the vents <b>2186</b> may extend a certain amount so the patient can use their compression vest system <b>2100</b> until a next different size is required.</p>
<p id="p-0245" num="0240">With the belt <b>2150</b> in the compact state, the vents <b>2186</b> may protrude from a surface of the exterior <b>2154</b> of the belt <b>2150</b>. However, with the elastic tension bands <b>2190</b> extended through the spaces between the surface of the exterior <b>2154</b> and the belt grips <b>2180</b> and attached to the exterior belt attachment segments <b>2172</b>, each elastic tension band <b>2190</b> can press down a respective vent <b>2186</b>. As result, any bulge that may result from vents <b>2186</b> being folded will be minimized by the normal function of the elastic tension bands <b>2190</b>. Accordingly, the vents <b>2186</b> will not obstruct an individual's ability to run their hand between one of the belt grips <b>2186</b> and the belt exterior <b>2154</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0246" num="0241">As illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>23</b>B</figref>, the zippers <b>2184</b> of the belt <b>2150</b> are closed. The sliders for each zipper <b>2184</b> are positioned at an upper edge of the belt <b>2150</b>. As one of ordinary skill in the art would readily recognize, moving the slider towards the bottom edge of the belt <b>2150</b> will cause opposing chains to disengage until the slider is moved to a stopper of one chain that is beyond the last tooth of the opposing chain, thereby separating the edges once joined. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>23</b>C and <b>23</b>D</figref> illustrate a case in which both of the zippers <b>2184</b> have been opened.

Each of the second vent edges <b>2186</b>B defines or substantially corresponds to a respective outer edge of the central strip <b>2155</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0248" num="0243">In one example, the vent <b>2186</b> includes first and second chains <b>2184</b>A, <b>2184</b>B of the zipper <b>2184</b> illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>23</b>D</figref>. Thus, the vent includes a section of fabric with long edges that either define or have attached thereto, tape on which a chain of teeth is included. Accordingly, either the tape or an edge of the section of fabric there attached is also attached to a respective outer edge of the central strip <b>2155</b> and an inner edge of a respective one of the first and second flanks <b>2156</b>, <b>2158</b>. In another example, the tape and chain are incorporated in the edges of the central strip <b>2155</b> and the first and second flanks <b>2156</b>, <b>2158</b>. In that case, the long edges of the section of fabric defining the vent <b>2186</b> will be sewn or otherwise permanently attached to an edge of the central strip <b>2155</b> and a respective one of the first and second flanks <b>2156</b>, <b>2158</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0249" num="0244">In either configuration for the vent <b>2186</b> discussed above, the vent <b>2186</b> may include two layers.

The second layer may be made of inelastic material and define a portion of the belt interior <b>2152</b> in the expanded state. As a result, the elastic layer in the compact state will limit a degree that the in-elastic layer will bulge out, and the in-elastic layer can limit an extent that the elastic layer can be stretched in the expanded state of the belt <b>2150</b>.</p>

In addition, the belt <b>3600</b> includes an anterior pocket <b>3680</b> configured to receive either or both of an extra-wide stay <b>3670</b> and a second modular segmented pouch <b>3700</b> (&#x201c;second modular pouch <b>3700</b>) illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>37</b></figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0268" num="0263">The extra-wide stay <b>3670</b> may be received or removed through an opening <b>3684</b> in the anterior pocket <b>3680</b> that may include opposing fastening strips <b>3686</b> with zipper chains or strips of hook and loop material. In practice: the opening <b>3684</b> may be opened by moving a slider of a zipper or pulling one fastening strip <b>3686</b> away from the other where a hook and loop access is utilized; the extra-wide stay <b>3670</b> can be positioned in the pocket <b>3680</b>; and the opening <b>3684</b> can be closed. As explained with reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>38</b>A and <b>38</b>B</figref>, the single wide shape of the extra-wide stay <b>3670</b> may be particularly beneficial to patients that have recently undergone open heart surgery, who need assistance with trunk control while at the same time needing to protect staples or stitches where an incision was made. A width of the extra-wide stay <b>3670</b> (i.e., a dimension extending along a longitudinal length of the belt <b>3600</b>) may be substantially equal to a width of an abdomen area of a patient wearing a compression vest system according to the present disclosure. The same options for material, edge-shape, and surface contour that can be used to provide the stays <b>2170</b>, <b>2870</b>, <b>2970</b>, <b>3070</b>, <b>3170</b> may be employed to provide the extra-wide stay <b>3670</b>. Further, the extra-wide stay <b>3670</b> can be formed with edges, surface contours, and an overall curvature that is customized to the shape of patient's abdomen so as to promote comfort.</p>

In one example, the anterior attachment segment <b>3688</b> extends over an entire width of the anterior pocket <b>3680</b>, which substantially corresponds to a width of the of the extra-wide stay <b>3670</b>. This in turn, may provide an attachment segment having a width the same as second modular pouch <b>3700</b>. In another example, the extra-wide stay <b>3670</b> having a smaller width may be provided, and the anterior pocket <b>3680</b> may be configured with vertical stitching inward of the edges of the anterior attachment segment <b>3688</b> so as to define an opening that corresponds to the width of the extra-wide stay <b>3670</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0270" num="0265">The second modular pouch <b>3700</b> may include a plurality of pockets <b>3364</b> which are defined by stitching <b>3368</b> in the pouch attachment segment <b>3782</b> to have a same configuration (e.g., size) as the pockets <b>3364</b> of the first modular pouch <b>3300</b>. However, as the second modular pouch <b>3700</b> is configured to attach to the attachment segment <b>3688</b> which may be smaller than the central attachment segment <b>3660</b> of the belt <b>3600</b>, and the second modular pouch <b>3700</b> may have fewer pockets <b>3364</b> than the first modular pouch <b>3300</b> as illustrated. Each of the pockets <b>3364</b> may be provided with a zipper <b>3382</b> (or hook and loop access), so that respective stays <b>3370</b> may be removed or replaced.</p>
<p id="p-0271" num="0266">It will be noted that both the first and second modular pouches <b>3300</b>, <b>3700</b> may be configured with some or all of their respective pockets <b>3364</b> provided with zippered or hook and loop access openings so that each pouch may be variably configured to apply compressive forces to a patient's trunk where most effective. For example, the second modular pouch <b>3700</b> may have three pockets <b>3364</b> but only a middle pocket <b>3364</b> may include a stay <b>3370</b>. Other configurations may provide stays <b>3370</b> only in the first and third pockets <b>3364</b>. A configuration of stays in the second modular pouch <b>3700</b> can be coordinated with a configuration of stays <b>3370</b> in the first modular pouch <b>3300</b> so that the localized/individual/targeted compressive forces are applied equidistantly around a circumference defined by a cross-section of a patient's (radially compressed&#x2014;given the action of the vest compression system <b>2100</b> including the belt <b>3600</b>) trunk. One of ordinary skill in the art will recognize that different configurations of stays <b>3370</b> can be implemented via the first and second modular pouches <b>3300</b>, <b>3700</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0272" num="0267"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>38</b>A and <b>38</b>B</figref> illustrate front and rear perspective views of a compression vest system <b>3800</b> including the vest <b>200</b> and the belt <b>3600</b>. The belt <b>3600</b> is provided with the first modular pouch <b>3300</b> attached to the central belt attachment segment <b>3660</b> (not shown), and the extra-wide stay <b>3670</b> positioned in the anterior pocket <b>3680</b>. As illustrated, the first modular pouch <b>3300</b> is provided with a stay <b>3370</b> in each of its respective pockets <b>3364</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0273" num="0268">As discussed above with reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>22</b>A and <b>22</b>B</figref>, the first compressive forces <b>1300</b> applied by the vest <b>200</b> provide general support to a patient's spine, especially with respect to opposing movement of the spine in sagittal and coronal body planes. Were the belt <b>3600</b>, absent the extra-wide stay <b>3670</b> and the first modular pouch <b>3300</b>, added to the vest <b>200</b> so as to be tightly or form-fittingly wrapped around the vest <b>200</b> worn by the patient <b>20</b>, it still would cause the second compressive forces <b>1302</b> to be generally/broadly exerted on the lower torso of the patient <b>20</b>. These second compressive forces <b>1302</b> being applied in the lumbar/sacral region of a patient have the effect of locking a trunk and hips of the patient relative to each other and a transverse body plane. With the trunk and hips locked in place in proper (or at least improved) spatial alignment relative to the transvers plane, movement and motor control of the muscles in the hips and lower back occur in a natural (or least less inhibited) manner for an individual for which movements involving these muscles are problematic.</p>
<p id="p-0274" num="0269">However, the illustrated belt <b>3600</b> includes the extra-wide stay <b>3670</b> and the first modular pouch <b>3300</b> as noted above. Each stay <b>3370</b> in the first modular pouch <b>3300</b> can exert a respective individual compressive force over a respective portion of a lumbar and sacral spinal region of a patient. More specifically, each stay <b>3370</b> may apply an individual compressive force <b>3850</b> that is transmitted over a corresponding area of the back panel <b>230</b> of the vest <b>200</b>. The first individual compressive forces <b>3850</b> are directed to a posterior of the patient in the lumbar and sacral portions of the patient's spine and may produce intracavitary pressure that reduces load on intervertebral discs. Further, the individual compressive forces <b>3850</b> may combine with the second compressive forces <b>1302</b> to increase a vector of force that locks the trunk and hips of the patient relative to each other and the transverse body plane. Accordingly, the stays <b>3370</b> can enhance an ability of the compression vest system to maintain the patient's trunk and hips in spatial alignment.</p>
<p id="p-0275" num="0270">Turning to the extra-wide stay <b>3670</b>, the belt <b>3600</b> in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>38</b>A and <b>38</b>B</figref> is orientated on the patient with the extra-wide stay <b>3670</b> positioned to apply a second individual compressive force <b>3880</b> to an anterior of the patient. With the width of the extra-wide stay <b>3670</b> being substantially greater than that of other stays discussed herein, when the belt <b>3600</b> is placed on the vest <b>200</b>, and respective tension bands are put in tension, the extra-wide stay <b>3670</b> exerts the second individual compressive force <b>3880</b> over an area substantially greater than the stays provided in the first modular pouch <b>3300</b>, for example. More specifically, the second individual compressive force <b>3880</b> may be applied uniformly over an area of the vest <b>200</b>, and thus over an area of an anterior of the patient, corresponding to at least the surface area of the extra-wide stay <b>3670</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0276" num="0271">As with the first individual compressive forces <b>3850</b>, the second individual compressive force <b>3880</b> can combine with the other compressive forces <b>1300</b>, <b>1302</b>, <b>3850</b> to better limit spinal displacement in the sagittal and coronal body planes, provide support that facilitates improved trunk control for a patient, and lock the hips and trunk relative to each other and the transverse body plane. As discussed above, directing the compressive force to an anterior of an individual may provide the additional support required to those individuals who experience mild to severely decreased trunk control, and provide structural support that yields overall functional improvements in those individuals with mild to severe alignment and structural spine issues like scoliosis.</p>
<p id="p-0277" num="0272">An added advantage of the size and shape of the extra-wide stay <b>3670</b> is how it can protect scares, wounds, incisions, or conceal and/or stabilize of devices, such as a catheter securement device. Each of the modular pouches described herein may offer some protection to a patient's incision, but the wide surface of the extra-wide stay <b>3670</b> ensures that only a substantially flat or ergonomically curved uniform plane of pressure is applied to the patient's skin where an incision or device may be disposed. Accordingly, pulling of the skin in different directions that may test an ability of sutures or staples to keep the incision closed may be minimized. Further, staples or devices like catheters are less likely to be caught on or moved by undulations in an individual's clothes, in particular when the individual moves, with the extra-wide stay <b>3670</b> applying the second individual compressive force over at least a respective surface area.</p>

<p id="p-0283" num="0278">The third modular pouches <b>4000</b> are positioned substantially equidistant to a midline of the patient. Such positioning may be incorporated in an effort to directionally (vector direction) balance the forces being applied to the patient's trunk. However, the belt <b>4000</b> is advantageously configured to allow the multiple arrangements, each capable of applying a unique combination of directional forces on the patient. More specifically, the extended central attachment segment <b>3960</b> of the belt <b>3900</b> illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>39</b></figref>, enables an individual, caregiver, or medical professional, to place modular segmented pouches in a variety of locations on the belt. When the belt <b>3900</b> is worn, each potential location for a modular pouch corresponds to a position along a circumference defined by an outer radial extent of a region of a patient including portions of their abdomen and lower back adjacent to a respective waist line. Thus, a caregiver, medical professional, or an individual prior to wearing a compression vest system, can customize where compressive forces are applied along the circumference. Thus, a cumulative effect of the all the compressive forces applied to a patient who is in moderate or significant need of trunk control support and assistance, can be tailored and optimized to obtain the most beneficial load reduction on the patient's spine, and yield the most significant functional improvement in the patient's muscles and joints during movement.</p>
