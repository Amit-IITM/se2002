<p id="p-0001" num="0000">A bladder for an article of footwear extends from an anterior end to a posterior end and includes a first chamber disposed in an interior region of the bladder and a second chamber at least partially surrounding the first chamber. The first chamber includes a first interior void having a first pressure and the second chamber includes a second interior void having a second pressure. In some implementations, the second chamber includes a plurality of lobes arranged in series and each having a first end, a second end, and an intermediate portion disposed between the first end and the second end. Each lobe has a greater thickness at the intermediate portion than at the first end and the second end, such that each lobe tapers from the intermediate portion to the first end and the second end.</p>

<p id="p-0003" num="0002">The present disclosure relates generally to sole structures for articles of footwear, and more particularly, to sole structures incorporating a bladder.</p>
<heading id="h-0003" level="1">BACKGROUND</heading>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">This section provides background information related to the present disclosure, which is not necessarily prior art.</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">Articles of footwear conventionally include an upper and a sole structure. The upper may be formed from any suitable material(s) to receive, secure, and support a foot on the sole structure. The upper may cooperate with laces, straps, or other fasteners to adjust the fit of the upper around the foot. A bottom portion of the upper, proximate to a bottom surface of the foot, attaches to the sole structure.</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">Sole structures generally include a layered arrangement extending between a ground surface and the upper. One layer of the sole structure includes an outsole that provides abrasion-resistance and traction with the ground surface. The outsole may be formed from rubber or other materials that impart durability and wear-resistance, as well as enhance traction with the ground surface. Another layer of the sole structure includes a midsole disposed between the outsole and the upper. The midsole provides cushioning for the foot and may be partially formed from a polymer foam material that compresses resiliently under an applied load to cushion the foot by attenuating ground-reaction forces. The midsole may additionally or alternatively incorporate a fluid-filled bladder to increase durability of the sole structure, as well as to provide cushioning to the foot by compressing resiliently under an applied load to attenuate ground-reaction forces. Sole structures may also include a comfort-enhancing insole or a sockliner located within a void proximate to the bottom portion of the upper and a strobel attached to the upper and disposed between the midsole and the insole or sockliner.</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">Midsoles employing bladders typically include a bladder formed from two barrier layers of polymer material that are sealed or bonded together. The bladders may contain air, and may incorporate tensile members within the bladder to retain the shape of the bladder when pressurized. Generally, bladders are designed with an emphasis on balancing support for the foot and cushioning characteristics that relate to responsiveness as the bladder resiliently compresses under an applied load</p>

<heading id="h-0005" level="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION</heading>
<p id="p-0022" num="0021">Example configurations will now be described more fully with reference to the accompanying drawings. Example configurations are provided so that this disclosure will be thorough, and will fully convey the scope of the disclosure to those of ordinary skill in the art. Specific details are set forth such as examples of specific components, devices, and methods, to provide a thorough understanding of configurations of the present disclosure. It will be apparent to those of ordinary skill in the art that specific details need not be employed, that example configurations may be embodied in many different forms, and that the specific details and the example configurations should not be construed to limit the scope of the disclosure.</p>
<p id="p-0023" num="0022">The terminology used herein is for the purpose of describing particular exemplary configurations only and is not intended to be limiting. As used herein, the singular articles &#x201c;a,&#x201d; &#x201c;an,&#x201d; and &#x201c;the&#x201d; may be intended to include the plural forms as well, unless the context clearly indicates otherwise. The terms &#x201c;comprises,&#x201d; &#x201c;comprising,&#x201d; &#x201c;including,&#x201d; and &#x201c;having,&#x201d; are inclusive and therefore specify the presence of features, steps, operations, elements, and/or components, but do not preclude the presence or addition of one or more other features, steps, operations, elements, components, and/or groups thereof. The method steps, processes, and operations described herein are not to be construed as necessarily requiring their performance in the particular order discussed or illustrated, unless specifically identified as an order of performance. Additional or alternative steps may be employed.</p>
<p id="p-0024" num="0023">When an element or layer is referred to as being &#x201c;on,&#x201d; &#x201c;engaged to,&#x201d; &#x201c;connected to,&#x201d; &#x201c;attached to,&#x201d; or &#x201c;coupled to&#x201d; another element or layer, it may be directly on, engaged, connected, attached, or coupled to the other element or layer, or intervening elements or layers may be present.</p>
<p id="p-0025" num="0024">In contrast, when an element is referred to as being &#x201c;directly on,&#x201d; &#x201c;directly engaged to,&#x201d; &#x201c;directly connected to,&#x201d; &#x201c;directly attached to,&#x201d; or &#x201c;directly coupled to&#x201d; another element or layer, there may be no intervening elements or layers present. Other words used to describe the relationship between elements should be interpreted in a like fashion (e.g., &#x201c;between&#x201d; versus &#x201c;directly between,&#x201d; &#x201c;adjacent&#x201d; versus &#x201c;directly adjacent,&#x201d; etc.). As used herein, the term &#x201c;and/or&#x201d; includes any and all combinations of one or more of the associated listed items.</p>
<p id="p-0026" num="0025">The terms first, second, third, etc. may be used herein to describe various elements, components, regions, layers and/or sections. These elements, components, regions, layers and/or sections should not be limited by these terms. These terms may be only used to distinguish one element, component, region, layer or section from another region, layer or section. Terms such as &#x201c;first,&#x201d; &#x201c;second,&#x201d; and other numerical terms do not imply a sequence or order unless clearly indicated by the context. Thus, a first element, component, region, layer or section discussed below could be termed a second element, component, region, layer or section without departing from the teachings of the example configurations.</p>
<p id="p-0027" num="0026">In one aspect of the disclosure, a bladder for an article of footwear is provided. The bladder extends from an anterior end to a posterior end and includes a first chamber disposed in an interior region of the bladder and including a first interior void having a first pressure, and a second chamber at least partially surrounding the first chamber and including a second interior void having a second pressure.</p>
<p id="p-0028" num="0027">Implementations of the disclosure may include one or more of the following optional features.</p>
<p id="p-0029" num="0028">In some examples, the bladder has a first width adjacent to the anterior end of the bladder, a second width adjacent to the posterior end of the bladder, and a third width in an intermediate portion that is less than the first width and the second width.</p>
<p id="p-0030" num="0029">In some configurations, the second chamber includes an anterior portion having a first cross-sectional area, a posterior portion having a second cross-sectional area, and an intermediate portion connecting the anterior portion and the posterior portion and having a third cross-sectional area. Here, the third cross-sectional area may be less than the first cross-sectional area. Optionally, the third cross-sectional area may be less than the second cross-sectional area. In some examples, the third cross-sectional area may be less than the first cross-sectional area and the second cross-sectional area.</p>
<p id="p-0031" num="0030">In some implementations, the bladder includes a web area disposed between and connecting the first chamber and the second chamber.</p>
<p id="p-0032" num="0031">In some examples, the bladder includes a first barrier layer and a second barrier layer joined together at discrete locations to define the first chamber and the second chamber. Optionally, at least one of the first barrier layer and the second barrier layer is transparent. In some examples, at least one of the first barrier layer and the second barrier layer is translucent.</p>
<p id="p-0033" num="0032">In some configurations, the second chamber completely surrounds the first chamber.</p>

In some embodiments, one or both of the barrier layers <b>118</b>, <b>120</b> are each produced (e.g., thermoformed or blow molded) from a monolayer film (a single layer). In other embodiments, one or both of the barrier layers <b>118</b>, <b>120</b> are each produced (e.g., thermoformed or blow molded) from a multilayer film (multiple sublayers). In either aspect, each layer or sublayer can have a film thickness ranging from about 0.2 micrometers to about be about 1 millimeter.

In comparison, for an opaque barrier layer, light does not pass through the barrier layer and one cannot see clearly through the barrier layer at all. A translucent barrier layer falls between a transparent barrier layer and an opaque barrier layer, in that light passes through a translucent layer but some of the light is scattered so that a viewer cannot see clearly through the layer.</p>
<p id="p-0058" num="0057">The barrier layers <b>118</b>, <b>120</b> can each be produced from an elastomeric material that includes one or more thermoplastic polymers and/or one or more cross-linkable polymers.

<p id="p-0080" num="0079">Referring now to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>, the thickness T<sub>106 </sub>the bladder <b>106</b> generally increases along a direction from the anterior end <b>112</b> to the posterior end <b>114</b>.

Instead, the thickness of the bladder <b>106</b> incrementally increases along the length L<sub>106 </sub>of the bladder <b>106</b>. For example, the bladder <b>106</b> has a first thickness T<sub>106-1 </sub>at the anterior end <b>112</b> defined by the intermediate portions <b>158</b><i>a</i>, <b>158</b><i>b </i>of the anterior lobes <b>152</b><i>a</i>, <b>152</b><i>b</i>, a second thickness T<sub>106-2 </sub>in the intermediate region <b>116</b> defined by the intermediate portions <b>158</b><i>d</i>, <b>158</b><i>e </i>of the intermediate lobes <b>152</b><i>d</i>, <b>152</b><i>e</i>, and a third thickness T<sub>106-3 </sub>at the posterior end <b>114</b> defined by the intermediate portion <b>158</b><i>c </i>of the posterior lobe <b>152</b><i>c</i>. Here, the second thickness T<sub>106-2 </sub>is greater than the first thickness T<sub>106-1 </sub>and less than the third thickness T<sub>106-3</sub>, such that an average thickness of the bladder <b>106</b> increases from the anterior end <b>112</b> to the posterior end <b>114</b>. Furthermore, as shown in the cross-sectional view of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b></figref>, the thickness of the bladder <b>106</b> also incrementally increases along the longitudinal axis A<sub>106</sub>. Accordingly, the bladder <b>106</b> has a thickness T<sub>1064 </sub>at the first ends <b>154</b><i>a</i>, <b>154</b><i>b </i>of the anterior lobes <b>152</b><i>a</i>, <b>152</b><i>b </i>that is less than the thickness T<b>130</b> of the interior chamber <b>130</b>, which is, in turn, less than the thickness T<sub>106-3 </sub>at the posterior lobe <b>152</b><i>c. </i></p>
<p id="p-0081" num="0080">The chambers <b>130</b>, <b>132</b> can be provided in a fluid-filled (e.g., as provided in footwear <b>10</b>) or in an unfilled state. The chambers <b>130</b>, <b>132</b> can be filled to include any suitable fluid, such as a gas or liquid. In an aspect, the gas can include air, nitrogen (N<sub>2</sub>), or any other suitable gas. The fluid provided to the chambers <b>130</b>, <b>132</b> can result in the bladder <b>106</b> being pressurized. Alternatively, the fluid provided to the chambers <b>130</b>, <b>132</b> can be at atmospheric pressure such that the chambers <b>130</b>, <b>132</b> are not pressurized but, rather, simply contains a volume of fluid at atmospheric pressure. In other aspects, the chambers <b>130</b>, <b>132</b> can alternatively include other compressible media, such as pellets, beads, ground recycled material, and the like (e.g., foamed beads and/or rubber beads).</p>
<p id="p-0082" num="0081">In the illustrated example, the interior void <b>134</b> of the interior chamber <b>130</b> includes a first fluid at a first pressure and the interior void <b>136</b> of the peripheral chamber <b>132</b> includes a second fluid at a second pressure. As discussed above, the interior chamber <b>130</b> is isolated from the peripheral chamber <b>132</b> such that the first pressure and the second pressure may be independently maintained within the interior voids <b>134</b>, <b>136</b>. The first pressure and the second pressure may be different from each other. For instance, the first pressure within the interior void <b>134</b> of the interior chamber <b>130</b> may be less than the second pressure within the interior void <b>136</b> of the peripheral chamber <b>132</b> when the bladder <b>106</b> is in an uncompressed (i.e., natural) state. In some examples, the first pressure ranges from 0 psi to 20 psi, and more particularly from 5 psi to 15 psi, and even more particularly from 7 psi to 10 psi. The second pressure may range from 0 psi to 35 psi, and more particularly from 15 psi to 30 psi, and even more particularly from 20 psi to 25 psi.</p>
<p id="p-0083" num="0082">Providing the bladder <b>106</b> with an interior chamber <b>130</b> having a lower pressure than the surrounding peripheral chamber <b>132</b> allows the interior chamber <b>130</b> to provide a softer cushioning response to a point load applied by the central portion of the heel when sole structure <b>100</b> contacts a ground surface. Upon initial compression of the interior chamber <b>130</b>, the higher pressure of the peripheral chamber <b>130</b> provides secondary cushioning around a perimeter of the heel. Furthermore, the higher pressure of the peripheral chamber <b>132</b> provides the heel region with enhanced lateral (i.e., side-to-side, front-to-back) stability. Thus, the dual-chamber configuration of the bladder <b>106</b> advantageously provides both impact attenuation and stability.</p>
<p id="p-0084" num="0083">With continued reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>1</b>-<b>4</b></figref>, the chassis <b>108</b> of the sole structure <b>100</b> extends continuously from the anterior end <b>18</b> to the posterior end <b>20</b>.

The chassis <b>108</b> further includes a bottom surface <b>162</b> and a recessed surface <b>164</b> formed on an opposite side of the chassis <b>108</b> than the top surface <b>160</b>. In the illustrated example, the bottom surface <b>162</b> extends from the anterior end <b>18</b> of the sole structure <b>100</b> and terminates at an intermediate portion of the chassis <b>108</b> in the midfoot region <b>14</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0085" num="0084">The recessed surface <b>164</b> is spaced between the top surface <b>160</b> and the bottom surface <b>162</b>, and defines a recess <b>166</b> in the heel region <b>16</b> of the sole structure <b>100</b> that is configured to receive the bladder <b>106</b>. Thus, a depth or height of the recess <b>166</b> is defined by the offset distance between the bottom surface <b>162</b> and the recessed surface <b>164</b>. Here, the height of the recess <b>166</b> is configured such that when the bladder <b>106</b> is disposed within the recess <b>166</b>, the lower surface <b>128</b> of the bladder <b>106</b> and the bottom surface <b>162</b> of the chassis <b>108</b> will cooperate to form a bottom support surface of the midsole <b>102</b> that attaches to the outsole <b>104</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0086" num="0085">As best shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b></figref>, the recessed surface <b>164</b> may include one or more supports <b>168</b> configured to interface with the bladder <b>106</b>.

Accordingly, compression forces applied to the top surface <b>160</b> of the chassis <b>108</b> in the heel region <b>16</b> are transferred to the bladder <b>108</b> as localized loads by the one or more supports <b>168</b>-<b>168</b><i>e</i>. Thus, the chassis <b>108</b> is not in continuous contact with the upper barrier layer <b>118</b>, but instead contacts the upper barrier layer <b>118</b> at one or more discrete interfaces between a lower support surface <b>170</b> of each support <b>168</b>-<b>168</b><i>e </i>and the upper barrier layer <b>118</b>. For example, the lower support surfaces <b>170</b>-<b>170</b><i>e </i>of the supports <b>168</b>-<b>168</b><i>e </i>may be configured to contact the uppermost portions of the upper barrier layer <b>118</b>.</p>

The cushioning element <b>172</b> is formed as a first part and extends from the anterior end <b>18</b> to the posterior end <b>20</b>. The cushioning element <b>172</b> defines the top surface <b>160</b> and the bottom surface <b>162</b> of the chassis <b>108</b>.

<p id="p-0091" num="0090">In examples where the chassis <b>108</b> is formed as a composite structure including the cushioning element <b>172</b> and the cradle <b>174</b>, the cushioning element <b>172</b> and the cradle <b>174</b> may be formed of materials having different properties.
