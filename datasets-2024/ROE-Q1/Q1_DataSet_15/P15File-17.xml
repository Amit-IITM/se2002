<heading id="h-0002" level="1">FIELD</heading>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">This application relates to the field of surface cleaning apparatus and power packs for the same.</p>
<heading id="h-0003" level="1">INTRODUCTION</heading>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">The following is not an admission that anything discussed below is part of the prior art or part of the common general knowledge of a person skilled in the art.</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">Various types of surface cleaning apparatus are known, including upright surface cleaning apparatus, canister surface cleaning apparatus, stick surface cleaning apparatus, central vacuum systems, and hand carriable surface cleaning apparatus such as hand vacuums. Further, various designs for cyclonic hand vacuum cleaners, including battery operated cyclonic hand vacuum cleaners, are known in the art.</p>
<heading id="h-0004" level="1">SUMMARY</heading>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">Surface cleaning apparatus, such as hand vacuum cleaners may be operable on batteries. Depending upon the number of batteries provided on board a surface cleaning apparatus, the batteries may be the most expensive component of a surface cleaning apparatus and/or the heaviest component. In the design of a surface cleaning apparatus and, in particular, a hand vacuum cleaner, the weight of the product is an important design consideration. At the same time, the performance of the surface cleaning apparatus is dependent upon the available power, i.e., the number of batteries that are provided on board. Any battery pack will provide a certain amount of power. The amount of on board power may be used to produce a higher air flow, so as to provide better cleaning performance. However, this will result in a surface cleaning apparatus having a shorter run time. Conversely, the amount of on board power may be used to provide a longer run time, which will result in a reduced level of air flow and therefore a reduced cleaning performance.</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">Accordingly, a manufacturer may elect to design a surface cleaning apparatus to have better cleaning performance or a longer run time. The design of any product will be a compromise based on expected consumer preferences.</p>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">In accordance with this disclosure, a surface cleaning apparatus may be designed to have different modes of operation depending upon the level of on board power that is provided. Accordingly, the surface cleaning apparatus may be constructed to enable the surface cleaning apparatus to operate in a different mode when more power is provided on board (e.g., a battery pack having a higher level of power is provided and/or a supplemental battery pack is provided). The provision of the additional power may unlock the second mode. Accordingly, for example, a mechanical actuator may be inhibited from move to a particular position until the additional power is provided. In the case of a touch control (e.g., a digital user interface), a particular operating mode control may not be displayed or actuatable until the additional power is provided. The second mode may comprise one or more of a higher power (higher air flow) operating mode, enabling an additional component of the surface cleaning apparatus to operate (e.g., a brush motor), enabling a brush motor to operate at a higher power level, etc.</p>
<p id="p-0009" num="0008">Accordingly, a user may purchase a surface cleaning apparatus and, if they determine that they require a surface cleaning apparatus with, e.g., a higher power mode, the user may then buy a second battery pack that has a higher level of power than the original battery pack that was provided with the surface cleaning apparatus and/or a supplemental battery pack to enhance the power provided by the original battery pack. The additional on board power then unlocks the higher power mode of operation.</p>
<p id="p-0010" num="0009">In accordance with one aspect of this disclosure, a surface cleaning apparatus is provided that is powered by one or both of a first power pack and a second power pack. When the second power pack is provided, the surface cleaning apparatus receives a higher level of on board power that enables the user to actuate the suction motor to operate at a higher operating power. An advantage of this design is that the provision of the second power pack enables additional functionality of the surface cleaning apparatus. Accordingly, the user can select the desired operating power of the surface cleaning apparatus to better suit their cleaning needs.</p>
<p id="p-0011" num="0010">In accordance with this aspect, there is provided a surface cleaning apparatus having an air flow path from a dirty air inlet to a clean air outlet with an air treatment member and a suction motor provided in the air flow path, the surface cleaning apparatus has a suction motor actuator, the suction motor actuator is actuatable to actuate the suction motor to operate in a first mode of operation and to operate in a second mode of operation, the first mode of operation defining a first discrete power level for the suction motor and the second mode of operation defining a second discrete power level for the suction motor,

<p id="p-0018" num="0020">In any embodiment, when the suction motor actuator is pressed a first time and either the first or the second power pack is provided to power the surface cleaning apparatus, the first mode of operation may be actuated, and when the suction motor actuator is pressed a second time and the second power pack is provided to power the surface cleaning apparatus, the second mode of operation may be actuated and the second mode of operation may only be actuatable when the second power pack is provided.</p>

<heading id="h-0007" level="2">General Description of a Vacuum Cleaner</heading>
<p id="p-0122" num="0156">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>1</b>A-<b>1</b>B</figref>, an exemplary embodiment of a surface cleaning apparatus is shown generally as <b>100</b>. The following is a general discussion of apparatus <b>100</b>, which provides a basis for understanding several of the features that are discussed herein. As discussed subsequently, each of the features may be used individually or in any particular combination or sub-combination in this or in other embodiments disclosed herein.</p>
<p id="p-0123" num="0157">Surface cleaning apparatus <b>100</b> may be any type of surface cleaning apparatus, including for example a stick vacuum cleaner as shown, a hand vacuum cleaner, an upright vacuum cleaner (which may optionally have a lift away cleaning unit that has one or more air cleaning members and a suction motor), a canister vacuum cleaner, an extractor, or a wet/dry type vacuum cleaner.</p>
<p id="p-0124" num="0158">In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>1</b>A-<b>2</b></figref>, the surface cleaning apparatus <b>100</b> is illustrated as a stick vacuum cleaner. As exemplified, the stick vacuum cleaner includes a portable cleaning unit, which may also be referred to as a &#x201c;hand vacuum cleaner&#x201d;, a &#x201c;handvac&#x201d; or &#x201c;hand-held vacuum cleaner&#x201d;. As used herein, a hand vacuum cleaner is a vacuum cleaner that can be operated to clean a surface generally one-handedly. That is, the entire weight of the vacuum may be held by the same one hand used to direct a dirty air inlet of the vacuum cleaner with respect to a surface to be cleaned. This is to be contrasted with canister and upright vacuum cleaners, whose weight is typically supported by a surface (e.g., a floor) during use. When a canister vacuum cleaner is operated, or when an upright vacuum cleaner is operated in a &#x2018;lift-away&#x2019; configuration, a second hand is typically required to direct the dirty air inlet at the end of a flexible hose.</p>
<p id="p-0125" num="0159">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>1</b>A-<b>2</b></figref>, surface cleaning apparatus <b>100</b> includes a portable cleaning unit <b>120</b> having a main body or a handvac body <b>122</b> having an air treatment member (which may be permanently affixed to the main body or may be removable in part or in whole therefrom for emptying), a dirty air inlet <b>124</b>, a clean air outlet <b>126</b>, and an air flow path extending between the dirty air inlet <b>124</b> and the clean air outlet <b>126</b>. It will be appreciated that dirty air inlet <b>124</b> and clean air outlet <b>126</b> may be positioned in different locations of apparatus <b>100</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0126" num="0160">A suction motor <b>160</b> is provided to generate vacuum suction through air flow path. Suction motor <b>160</b> may be a fan-motor assembly including an electric motor and impeller blade(s). An air treatment member (not shown) is configured to remove particles of dirt and other debris from the air flow. The air treatment member may comprise a cyclone assembly (also referred to as a &#x201c;cyclone bin assembly&#x201d;) having a single cyclonic cleaning stage with a single cyclone and a dirt collection chamber that is external to the cyclone (also referred to as a &#x201c;dirt collection region&#x201d;, &#x201c;dirt collection bin&#x201d;, &#x201c;dirt bin&#x201d;, or &#x201c;dirt chamber&#x201d;). The cyclone and dirt collection chamber may be of any configuration suitable for separating dirt from an air stream and collecting the separated dirt respectively, and may be in communication dirt outlet(s) of the cyclone chamber.</p>
<p id="p-0127" num="0161">In alternate embodiments, the air treatment member may include a cyclone assembly having two or more cyclonic cleaning stages arranged in series with each other. Each cyclonic cleaning stage may include one or more cyclones arranged in parallel with each other and one or more dirt collection chambers, of any suitable configuration. The dirt collection chamber(s) may be external to the cyclone chambers of the cyclones or internal of the cyclone chamber. Each cyclone may have its own dirt collection chamber or two or more cyclones fluidically connected in parallel may have a single common dirt collection chamber. Alternately, any other air treatment member known in the art, such as a bag or a non-cyclonic momentum separator may be used.</p>
<p id="p-0128" num="0162">The hand vacuum cleaner <b>120</b> may include a pre-motor filter provided in the air flow path downstream of the air treatment member and upstream of suction motor <b>160</b>. The pre-motor filter may be formed from any suitable physical, porous filter media. For example, the pre-motor filter may be one or more of a foam filter, felt filter, HEPA filter, or other physical filter media. In some embodiments, the pre-motor filter may include an electrostatic filter, or the like. The pre-motor filter may be located in a pre-motor filter housing that is external to the air treatment member.</p>
<p id="p-0129" num="0163">In the illustrated embodiments, dirty air inlet <b>124</b> is the inlet end of an air inlet conduit <b>128</b>. Optionally, the inlet end of air inlet conduit <b>128</b> can be used as a nozzle to directly clean a surface. Alternatively, or in addition to functioning as a nozzle, air inlet conduit <b>128</b> may be connected (e.g., directly connected) to the downstream end of any suitable accessory tool such as a rigid air flow conduit (e.g., an above floor cleaning wand), a crevice tool, a mini brush, and the like. For example, as exemplified in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b>B</figref>, the air inlet conduit <b>128</b> of the hand vacuum cleaner <b>120</b> is connectable to a wand <b>130</b>. The wand <b>130</b> may be used to extend the reach of the hand vacuum cleaner <b>120</b>. As exemplified, the wand <b>130</b> may provide an air flow conduit <b>132</b> for connecting the hand vacuum cleaner <b>120</b> to a surface cleaning head <b>140</b>, having a dirty air inlet <b>142</b>. In some embodiments, the hand vacuum cleaner <b>120</b> may be directly connectable to the surface cleaning head <b>140</b>. In some embodiments, the wand <b>130</b> may be a separate accessory for lengthening the air inlet conduit <b>128</b> of the hand vacuum cleaner <b>120</b> and may not be in air flow communication with the surface cleaning head <b>140</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0130" num="0164">It will be appreciated that the surface cleaning head <b>140</b> may be any type of surface cleaning head. For example, the surface cleaning head <b>140</b> may be a dry cleaning head as exemplified, or may be a wet cleaning head such as a wet mop cleaning head.</p>
<p id="p-0131" num="0165">Accordingly, in operation, after activating the suction motor <b>160</b>, dirty air enters apparatus <b>100</b> through dirty air inlet <b>124</b> and is directed along air inlet conduit <b>128</b> to the air treatment member. Dirt particles and other debris may be disentrained (i.e., separated) from the dirty air flow as the dirty air flow travels through the air treatment member. The disentrained dirt particles and debris may be discharge from the air treatment member into the dirt collection chamber, in which the dirt particles and debris may be collected and stored until the dirt collection chamber is emptied.</p>
<p id="p-0132" num="0166">Air exiting the air treatment member may be directed through the pre-motor filter, and then travel to the suction motor <b>160</b> and may then be subsequently discharged from apparatus <b>100</b> through clean air outlet <b>126</b>. Prior to exiting the clean air outlet <b>126</b>, the treated air may pass through a post-motor filter, which may be one or more layers of filter media.</p>
<p id="p-0133" num="0167">Power may be supplied to the suction motor <b>160</b> and other electrical components of apparatus <b>100</b> from an on board energy storage member, also referred to as a power pack, which may include, for example, one or more batteries or other energy storage device such as a capacitor. As discussed herein a battery pack may comprise one or more energy storage members, such as one or more batteries and/or one or more capacitors, which may be enclosed in a housing.</p>
<heading id="h-0008" level="2">Suction Motor Actuator</heading>
<p id="p-0134" num="0168">In accordance with this aspect, which may be used by itself or in combination with one or more other aspects, the surface cleaning apparatus <b>100</b> has a motor and fan assembly that is operable in one or more additional power or flow modes when additional on board power is provided. Accordingly, for example, a user may be able to upgrade their, e.g., hand vacuum cleaner, to have a high power mode by inserting a supplemental battery pack or replacing the original battery pack with a higher powered battery pack.</p>
<p id="p-0135" num="0169">For example, a surface cleaning apparatus may have a suction motor actuator (which could be mechanical or digital), for changing a mode of operation of the suction motor from, e.g., a low power mode to a high power mode wherein the higher power mode of operation of the suction motor is enabled by the inclusion of one or more power supplemental battery packs and/or inserting an alternate higher powered battery pack. The power packs vary (e.g., increase) the level of on board power available to the surface cleaning apparatus. Depending on the provided level of on board power, different modes of operation of the suction motor may be enabled or disabled. An advantage of this aspect is that the provision of more power packs, or a power pack of greater capacity, may be used to enable different modes of operation of the suction motor. Accordingly, a user may upgrade the surface cleaning apparatus <b>100</b> to have a higher level of on board power to improve the operation of the surface cleaning apparatus <b>100</b>. For example, the inclusion of a larger capacity power pack may enable the suction motor to operate in a higher flow mode, thereby improving the efficiency of the surface cleaning apparatus <b>100</b>. Alternately, the suction motor may be operable on a medium power mode when the on board power is upgraded to a first higher power level and a high power mode when the on board power is upgraded to a second higher power level.</p>
<p id="p-0136" num="0170">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref>, the surface cleaning apparatus <b>100</b> has a suction motor <b>160</b> and a suction motor actuator <b>162</b>. The suction motor actuator <b>162</b> is actuatable to actuate the suction motor <b>160</b> to operate in different modes of operation. For example, the suction motor <b>160</b> may operate in a first mode of operation and a second mode of operation. In accordance with this exemplary embodiment, the first mode of operation defines a first, discrete power level for the suction motor <b>160</b>, while the second mode of operation defines a second, discrete power level for the suction motor <b>160</b>. As used herein, a discrete power level means a specific power setting such as a low mode and a high mode.</p>
<p id="p-0137" num="0171">It will be appreciated that there may be any number of different modes of operation of the suction motor <b>160</b>. For example, the first mode of operation may be a low flow mode, requiring a first level on board power and the second mode of operation may be a high flow mode, requiring more on board power than the first mode of operation (a second level on board power). It will also be appreciated that each mode of operation may have one or more sub-modes. For example, the first mode of operation may include a low flow mode and a medium flow mode, where the medium flow mode operates between low flow mode and the high flow mode. The medium flow mode may operate on the first level of on board power.</p>
<p id="p-0138" num="0172">To provide the different power levels for the suction motor <b>160</b>, one or more power packs are provided in the surface cleaning apparatus <b>100</b>. Each power pack may include one or more batteries, capacitors, or other energy storage members. For example, when a first power pack <b>200</b> is provided, the first power pack <b>200</b> provides a first level of on board power that is available to power the surface cleaning apparatus <b>100</b>. When a second power pack <b>210</b> is provided, a second level of on board power is available to power the surface cleaning apparatus <b>100</b>. The second level of on board power is greater than the first level of on board power. In other words, when the first power pack <b>200</b> is provided, the suction motor <b>160</b> may operate, for example, in the low or low and medium flow modes as the first mode of operation and when the second power pack <b>210</b> is provided, the suction motor <b>160</b> may operate in the high flow mode as the second mode of operation. Each of the first power pack <b>200</b> and the second power pack <b>210</b> may be removably receivable within the surface cleaning apparatus <b>100</b>. Alternately, the first power pack <b>200</b> may be fixed within the surface cleaning apparatus <b>100</b>, while the second power pack <b>210</b> is removably receivable within the surface cleaning apparatus <b>100</b>. Accordingly, the second power pack <b>210</b> may be a supplemental battery pack that is mountable to the surface cleaning apparatus <b>100</b> or an alternate battery pack that replaces the first battery pack <b>200</b>. It will be appreciated that, optionally, a series of power packs, each having a different level of on board power, may be provided and each may be removably receivable in the same recess or, each may be receivable is a different recess.</p>
<p id="p-0139" num="0173">As exemplified in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>4</b>-<b>6</b></figref>, the surface cleaning apparatus <b>100</b> may have a power pack docking station <b>230</b> for receiving one, two or more power packs. It will be appreciated that the power pack docking station <b>230</b> may be any structure that removably receives a power pack. Accordingly, the power pack docking station <b>230</b> may be a recess or opening provided in a main body of a surface cleaning apparatus for removable receiving a power pack. It will be appreciated that the power pack docking station <b>230</b> may be a single recess into which the first power pack <b>200</b> and the second power pack <b>210</b> are alternately receivable. Alternately, the power pack docking station <b>230</b> may comprise a first recess into which the first power pack <b>200</b> is removably receivable and a second recess into which the second power pack is receivable, optionally while the first power pack <b>200</b> is installed or while when the first power pack <b>200</b> has been removed.</p>
<p id="p-0140" num="0174">It will be appreciated that, by using alternate energy storage members, the second power pack <b>210</b> may have be able to store a greater level of on board power then the first power pack <b>200</b>, but may have the same or essentially the same physical size. Accordingly, the recess into which the power packs are alternately removably receivable may be sized to physically support the power packs, e.g., the length and width of the recess in a direction transverse to an insertion direction of the power packs <b>200</b>, <b>210</b> may be slightly larger than the length and width of the power packs <b>200</b>, <b>210</b> in the direction transverse to the insertion direction of the power packs.</p>
<p id="p-0141" num="0175">It will also be appreciated that the first power pack <b>200</b> may have the same length and width as the second power pack <b>210</b> but that the second power pack <b>210</b> may have more, e.g., batteries, than the first power pack <b>200</b> and may therefore have a larger depth in the direction of insertion then the first power pack <b>200</b>. The recess may be sized to receive therein the entire depth of the second power pack <b>210</b> such that the second power pack is fully inserted into the surface cleaning apparatus <b>100</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0142" num="0176"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>4</b>-<b>6</b></figref> exemplify a power pack docking station <b>230</b> that is sized to alternately receive the first power pack <b>200</b> (see <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b></figref>) and a single larger second power pack <b>210</b> (see <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>6</b></figref>). As exemplified in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b></figref>, the power pack docking station <b>230</b> may also receive each of the first power pack <b>200</b> and the second power pack <b>210</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0143" num="0177">As exemplified in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b></figref>, power pack <b>200</b> is provided in docking station <b>230</b>. If power pack <b>200</b> is removable mountable in docking station <b>230</b>, then docking station <b>230</b> will have a set of electrical contacts and power pack <b>200</b> will have a mating pair of electrical contacts such that power pack <b>200</b> is electrically connected to surface cleaning apparatus <b>100</b> when power pack <b>200</b> inserted into the docking station <b>230</b>. The first power pack <b>200</b> has a first level of power storage.</p>
<p id="p-0144" num="0178">As exemplified in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b></figref>, the docking station <b>230</b> is sized to receive each of the first power pack <b>200</b> and the second power pack <b>210</b>. Accordingly, the second power pack <b>210</b> may be utilized concurrently with the first power pack <b>200</b> to power a surface cleaning apparatus <b>100</b> and is therefore a supplementary power pack. Combined, the first and second power packs <b>200</b>, <b>210</b> provide a second level of on board power storage. The second power pack <b>210</b> itself provides a third level of power storage which may be the same as, less than or more than the first level of power storage.</p>
<p id="p-0145" num="0179">As with the first power pack <b>200</b>, the docking station <b>230</b> may have a set of electrical contacts and power pack <b>210</b> may have a mating pair of electrical contacts such that power pack <b>210</b> is electrically connected to surface cleaning apparatus <b>100</b> when power pack <b>210</b> inserted into the docking station <b>230</b>. Therefore, as exemplified in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b></figref>, docking station may be a single recess that is sized to enable both power packs <b>200</b>, <b>210</b> to be inserted and engage their respective electrical contacts that are provides within the single recess. It will be appreciated that, in an alternate embodiment, the docking station <b>230</b> may comprise a two recesses, each of which is sized to receive a power pack <b>200</b>, <b>210</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0146" num="0180">As exemplified in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>6</b></figref>, the second power pack <b>210</b>, has a larger power capacity than the first power pack <b>200</b> and is physically larger than the first power pack <b>200</b>. The docking station <b>230</b> is sized to receive the second power pack <b>210</b> but, due to the size of the second power pack <b>210</b>, the first power pack <b>200</b> may not be concurrently mounted in the docking station <b>230</b>. Accordingly, the first power pack <b>200</b> may be removed from the surface cleaning apparatus <b>100</b> and may be replaced with the second, larger power pack <b>210</b>. The second power pack <b>210</b> may then provide the second, greater level of on board power to the surface cleaning apparatus <b>100</b>. It will be appreciated that, in such an embodiment, the second power pack <b>210</b> may engage any of the sets of electrical contacts provided in the docking station or, alternately, a third set of electrical contacts may be provided in the docking station <b>230</b> for the second power pack <b>210</b> to engage.</p>
<p id="p-0147" num="0181">It will be appreciated that there may be any number of power packs removably receivable in the surface cleaning apparatus <b>100</b>. The capacity of each power pack may vary or may be the same. Accordingly, a user (or a manufacturer) may choose the level of desired on board power and select the appropriate power pack and/or power packs to achieve the desired level of on board power.</p>
<p id="p-0148" num="0182">In accordance with this aspect, the selected level of on board power is used to enable or disable the modes of operation of the suction motor <b>160</b>. For example, the first mode of operation is enabled when the first power pack <b>200</b> is provided to power the surface cleaning apparatus <b>100</b>. However, the second mode of operation is not enabled until the second power pack <b>210</b> is provided to power the surface cleaning apparatus <b>100</b>. In other words, the second power pack <b>210</b> is used to enable the second mode of operation of the suction motor <b>160</b>. As described above, the second power pack <b>210</b> may be a larger power pack than the first power pack <b>200</b> and may replace the first power pack <b>200</b>, as exemplified in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>6</b></figref>, or the second power pack <b>210</b> may be a supplemental power pack that operates with the first power pack <b>200</b> to provide the second level of on board power, as exemplified in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b></figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0149" num="0183">As exemplified in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>7</b>-<b>9</b></figref>, the suction motor actuator <b>162</b> may be a mechanical switch <b>162</b> that is movable a between an off position, a first on position, and a second on position. When the switch <b>162</b> is in the first on position, a first level of power is provided to the suction motor <b>160</b> and when the switch <b>162</b> is in the second on position, a second level of power is provided to the suction motor <b>160</b>, the second level of power being greater than the first level of power. As exemplified, the second on position is a high power mode of operation, which is enabled by the provision of the second power pack <b>210</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0150" num="0184">In some embodiments, the suction motor actuator <b>162</b> may only be moveable to the second on position once the second power pack <b>210</b> is provided to power the surface cleaning apparatus. For example, as exemplified in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>7</b>-<b>9</b></figref>, the suction motor actuator <b>162</b> is a slide switch that is slidable between the off (see <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>7</b></figref>), first on (see <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>8</b></figref>), and second on (see <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>9</b></figref>) positions. A lock <b>164</b> extends through the path of the slide switch <b>162</b>, preventing the switch <b>162</b> from sliding to the second on position (e.g., the high flow position) until the second power pack <b>210</b> is provided. As exemplified in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>9</b></figref>, the provision of the second power pack <b>210</b> unlocks the suction motor actuator <b>162</b> such that the suction motor actuator <b>162</b> is movable to the second on position. The lock <b>164</b> is unlocked by the second power pack <b>210</b> engaging with, and moving, the lock <b>164</b> out of the slide path of the switch <b>162</b>, thereby enabling the switch <b>162</b> to move to the second on position. As shown, a biasing member <b>166</b> provides an upward bias on the lock <b>164</b>, such that when the second pack <b>210</b> is removed, the lock <b>164</b> moves back to the locked position. It will be appreciated that the lock <b>164</b> may be any device capable of inhibiting the motion of the switch <b>162</b>, such that the switch <b>162</b> cannot enter the second on mode.</p>
<p id="p-0151" num="0185">While the examples show the inclusion of a supplementary power pack <b>210</b> to unlock the lock <b>164</b>, it will be appreciated that the lock <b>164</b> may be designed to be unlocked with the inclusion of a larger capacity second power pack <b>210</b> that replaces the first power pack <b>200</b>. For example, the larger capacity second power pack <b>210</b> may have an increased footprint within the surface cleaning apparatus <b>100</b> such that the second power pack <b>210</b> moveably engages with the lock <b>164</b>, while the smaller first power pack <b>200</b> does not.</p>
<p id="p-0152" num="0186">In an alternate embodiment, the lock may be disengaged upon the second power pack <b>210</b> engaging a set of electrical contacts positioned to engage the second power pack <b>210</b> when the second power pack <b>210</b> is inserted into the docking station <b>230</b> as discussed previously.</p>
<p id="p-0153" num="0187">In some embodiments, the surface cleaning apparatus <b>100</b> may include a digital user interface <b>180</b>, as exemplified in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>10</b>-<b>18</b></figref>.

As exemplified, the suction motor actuator <b>162</b> is a touch button provided on the digital user interface <b>180</b>. As described previously, the suction motor actuator <b>162</b> may be used to actuate the first and second modes of operation. For example, in some embodiments, when the suction motor actuator <b>162</b> is pressed a first time, and only the first power pack <b>200</b> is provided to power the surface cleaning apparatus, the first mode of operation is actuated. When the suction motor actuator <b>162</b> is pressed a second time, the surface cleaning apparatus may turn off. Similarly, when the suction motor actuator <b>162</b> is pressed a first time, and either the first power pack <b>200</b> and a supplemental second power pack <b>210</b> is provided or a single higher capacity second power pack <b>210</b> is provided to power the surface cleaning apparatus, the first mode of operation is actuated. When the suction motor actuator <b>162</b> is pressed a second time, the second mode of operation is actuated. When the suction motor actuator <b>162</b> is pressed a third time, the surface cleaning apparatus may turn off.

<p id="p-0154" num="0188">As exemplified in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>10</b>-<b>11</b> and <b>16</b>-<b>18</b></figref>, the suction motor actuator <b>162</b> may include a first actuation portion <b>162</b><i>a </i>and a second actuation portion <b>162</b><i>b </i>of the user interface <b>180</b>. The first mode of operation may be actuated when the first actuation portion <b>162</b><i>a </i>is operated by a user and the second mode of operation may be actuated when the second actuation portion <b>162</b><i>b </i>is operated by the user. As exemplified in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>10</b>-<b>11</b> and <b>16</b>-<b>18</b></figref>, the first actuation portion <b>162</b><i>a </i>actuates a low flow mode and the second actuation portion <b>162</b><i>b </i>actuates a high flow mode.</p>
<p id="p-0155" num="0189">As exemplified in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>10</b>-<b>18</b></figref>, the digital user interface <b>180</b> may change when the second power pack <b>210</b> is electrically connected to the surface cleaning apparatus <b>100</b>. As shown, the greyed-out regions indicate that the actuation portion is disabled while the white regions indicate that the actuation portion is enabled. For example, when only the first power pack <b>200</b> is provided, the digital user interface <b>180</b> may display an illuminated touch area as the first actuation portion <b>162</b><i>a </i>for actuating the first mode (i.e., on or off), as exemplified in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>10</b></figref>. When the second power pack <b>210</b> is provided, the digital user interface may display the second actuation portion <b>162</b><i>b </i>as a new illuminated area for actuating the second mode, as exemplified in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>11</b></figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0156" num="0190">It will be appreciated that the labelling of the actuation portions <b>162</b><i>a</i>, <b>162</b><i>b </i>may be varied when the second power pack <b>210</b> is provided.

Accordingly, the controls of the digital user interface <b>180</b> may vary depending on the power levels available to the surface cleaning apparatus <b>100</b> provided by the first power pack <b>200</b> and/or the second power pack <b>210</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0157" num="0191">In some embodiments, the surface cleaning apparatus <b>100</b> may include a controller that enables the second mode of operation when the second power pack <b>210</b> is provided to power the surface cleaning apparatus.

<heading id="h-0009" level="2">Brush Motor Actuator</heading>
<p id="p-0158" num="0192">In accordance with this aspect, which may be used by itself or in combination with one or more other aspects, the surface cleaning apparatus <b>100</b> has a surface cleaning head <b>140</b> with a brush motor <b>144</b> drivingly connected to a moveable brush member <b>146</b>.

<p id="p-0160" num="0194">It will be appreciated that the first mode of operation may be a carpet or high power brush on mode (a high speed of movement of the moveable brush member <b>146</b>).

However, when a supplemental power pack is provided or the original power pack is replaced by a second power pack <b>210</b>, the surface cleaning apparatus may have sufficient on board power to enable the brush motor to operate on a carpet cleaning mode while the suction motor is operational for a preset run time.</p>
<p id="p-0161" num="0195">It will be appreciated that the first mode of operation may also be a brush on mode.

<p id="p-0174" num="0208">In accordance with this aspect, which may be used by itself or in combination with one or more other aspects, the provision of a higher level of on board power to the surface cleaning apparatus <b>100</b> enables the operating power level of the suction motor <b>160</b> and/or the brush motor <b>144</b> to be increased.

Accordingly, a user can increase the operating power of the surface cleaning apparatus <b>100</b> with the provision of the second power pack <b>210</b> to improve the cleaning ability of the surface cleaning apparatus <b>100</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0175" num="0209">For example, the operating power level of one or more modes of operation of the suction motor may be increased when the on board power level is increased.

An advantage of this aspect is the provision of a higher level of on board power to the surface cleaning apparatus <b>100</b> enables the user to optionally select whether to use the additional on board power to extend the operational run time of the surface cleaning apparatus, to increase the operating power level of the suction motor <b>160</b> and/or the brush motor <b>144</b> or both. Adjusting the operating power levels may improve the cleaning efficacy of the surface cleaning apparatus <b>100</b>, while also allowing the user to control the rate of power consumption. As described previously, each the suction motor <b>160</b> and the brush motor <b>144</b> may be operable in a single power mode or a plurality of operating modes, such as a low mode of operation and a high mode of operation.</p>
<p id="p-0184" num="0218">The provision of the second power pack <b>210</b> may enable the power level adjustment controller <b>220</b> to be operable such that the user can adjust the operating power level provided to the suction motor <b>160</b> and/or the brush motor <b>144</b> in the low mode of operation and/or the high mode of operation. In other words, the user may adjust operating power of either the low mode of operation, the high mode of operation, or both modes of operation.</p>
<p id="p-0185" num="0219">As described previously, the suction motor <b>160</b> produces a low rate of flow in the low mode of operation and high rate of flow in the high mode of operation. When the second power pack <b>210</b> is provided, the low rate of flow and/or the high rate of flow may be adjustable by the user through use of the power level adjustment controller <b>220</b>. For example, the provision of the second power pack <b>210</b> may enable the power level adjustment controller <b>220</b> to adjust the high flow rate but may not enable adjustment of the low flow rate. Alternately, the provision of the second power pack <b>210</b> may enable the power level adjustment controller <b>220</b> to adjust both the low flow rate and the high flow rate.</p>
<p id="p-0186" num="0220">Similarly, the power level adjustment controller <b>220</b> may be used to adjust each rate of motion of the moveable brush member <b>146</b>. It will be appreciated that the power level adjustment controller <b>220</b> may be used to adjust one of the low speed mode and the high speed mode or both the low speed mode and the high speed mode.</p>
<p id="p-0187" num="0221">It will be appreciated that the power level controller <b>220</b> may be a mechanical control (e.g., a rotary dial or a slide switch) or a digital control. The power level controller may be operable between two positions (e.g., the power level adjustment controller <b>220</b> may enable the user to adjust the power level of the different modes of operation to a single, higher level of operation) or may enable the user to adjust the discrete amount by which the operating power level is increased or the power level controller may be infinitely adjustable. As exemplified in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>18</b></figref>, the power level adjustment controller <b>220</b> is adjustable between a <b>4</b> different positions, namely 25%, 50%, 75% and 100%. Each position may be for all operating levels of one or both of the suction motor and the brush motor. For example, if the user selects the 25% position, then in each of the operating positions of the brush motor and the suction motor (e.g., suction motor on low mode, suction motor on high mode, brush motor on low mode, brush motor on high mode), the power provided to the motor may be increased by 25%. Accordingly, the user may then selectively adjust an amount by which the operating power level is increased by adjusting the power level adjustment controller <b>220</b> through each of the plurality of positions.</p>
<p id="p-0188" num="0222">Alternately, the user may select that the power level controller <b>220</b> adjusts the power level to one of the brush motor and the suction motor. Accordingly, the user may select which motor has the power level adjusted and the user may then set the level of increase provided to that motor. It will be appreciated that a user may first select the suction motor and adjust the power level and may then select the brush motor and may then select the power level, which may be different to the power level selected for the brush motor.</p>
<p id="p-0189" num="0223">Alternately, a user may be able to select the power level provide for a particular operating mode of one or both of the suction motor and the brush motor. A user may therefore select, for example, the high mode of operation of the suction motor, and increase the operating power by 25%, 50%, 75%, or 100% for that operating mode of the suction motor.</p>
<p id="p-0190" num="0224">It will be appreciated that the increment of increase between each of the plurality of positions may vary.</p>
<p id="p-0191" num="0225">Similarly, the power level adjustment controller <b>220</b> may be used to enable the user to adjust the power level of the different modes of operation to a decreased operating power level. Decreasing the operating power level may increase the run time of the surface cleaning apparatus <b>100</b> due to the slower depletion of the first power pack <b>200</b> and/or the second power pack <b>210</b>. It will be appreciated that the power level controller <b>220</b> may be operable to decrease one or more operating power levels of the suction motor and/or the brush motor when the first power pack <b>200</b> is provided.</p>
<p id="p-0192" num="0226">The surface cleaning apparatus may also provide information to a user advising of the run time available based on the power pack provided and the operating mode selected. Accordingly, a user will be able to determine the run time of the surface cleaning apparatus <b>100</b> based on, e.g., if the brush motor is actuated and, if so, the mode of operation of the brush motor and the operating mode of the suction motor. It will be appreciated that the estimated run times will increase when the higher level of on board power is provided by the second power pack <b>210</b>. It will be appreciated that adjusting the power level using the power level controller <b>220</b> will adjust the run time. Therefore, when a user elects to, e.g., increase the power level provided to the suction motor, the run time of the surface cleaning apparatus using the on board power will decrease. Therefore, using the power level adjustment controller <b>220</b> in conjunction with an information display, the user may control the run time of the surface cleaning apparatus <b>100</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0193" num="0227">For example, the digital user interface <b>180</b> may provide run time and power level information to the user. When the second power pack <b>210</b> is provided, the power level adjustment controller <b>220</b> may be selectively operated by the user to adjust the power level and/or the run time. Adjusting the power level to a higher operating power level will result in more rapid depletion of the first power pack <b>200</b> and/or the second power pack <b>210</b>. More rapid depletion of the power packs will result in reduced run time, while resulting in increased operating power. Similarly, reducing the operating power level will result in a slower depletion of the first power pack <b>200</b> and/or the second power pack <b>210</b>. Slower depletion of the power packs will result in increased run time, while resulting in decreased operating power. Accordingly, when the second power pack <b>210</b> is provided, the user may operate the power level adjustment controller <b>220</b> to accommodate their cleaning needs. For example, if the user is cleaning a surface with minimal dirt and/or debris, less operating power may be required to sufficiently clean the surface, so the user may increase the run time of the surface cleaning apparatus <b>100</b> by reducing the operating power level. Alternately, if the user is cleaning a surface with large amounts of dirt and/or debris, more operating power may be required to sufficiently clean the surface, so the user may decrease the run time of the surface cleaning apparatus <b>100</b> by increasing the operating power level.</p>
<p id="p-0194" num="0228">It will be appreciated that if the surface cleaning apparatus provides run time information to a user, then the power level controller <b>220</b> may be operable by a user when the first power pack <b>200</b> is provided.</p>
<p id="p-0195" num="0229">It will also be appreciated that the digital user interface <b>180</b> may be operable to enable a user to select a desired run time, in which case the power level controller <b>220</b> may be automatically adjusted by, e.g., a controller, to adjust one or more power levels provided to the brush motor and/or the suction motor to enable the surface cleaning apparatus to have the selected run time. Optionally, the user may be able to select which motor and/or which power level is adjusted to achieve the selected run time.</p>
