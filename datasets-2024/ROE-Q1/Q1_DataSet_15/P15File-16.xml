<heading level="1" id="h-0002">TECHNICAL FIELD</heading>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">This disclosure relates to utensils for holding food adjacent to a campfire or other outdoor fire for roasting.</p>
<heading level="1" id="h-0003">BACKGROUND</heading>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">Campers sometimes use the heat from campfires to roast food such as hot dogs and marshmallows. To roast food, the food must be in sufficient proximity to the fire to receive adequate heat. However, the campers must maintain enough distance to avoid the negative effects of heat on their skin. To hold the food close to the fire while maintaining their hands at a sufficient distance from the fire to avoid burns or discomfort, various utensils, sometimes referred to as &#x201c;roasting sticks&#x201d; or &#x201c;roasting forks&#x201d; are employed.</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">These roasting utensils include a shaft having a grip or handle at one end and a food retention portion at the other end opposite the grip or handle. In most cases, the food retention portion is either a sharp end or a bifurcated fork on which the food is skewered, as understood by those skilled in the art. The shaft separates the food retention portion (which retains the food) from the grip (at which the camper holds the utensil) so that when the food retention portion and food are close enough to the fire for roasting, the grip and hand is far enough away to avoid burns or discomfort.</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">The roasting utensils are therefore, of necessity, long and have one or more sharp points at one end. This geometry and size makes roasting utensils cumbersome to store and clean. When not in use, the utensils are stored unhygienically on the ground or take up significant space on a picnic table, with the sharp skewer portions creating a poking hazard. If the utensils have been used, food residue on the food retention portions may also soil clothing or other surfaces that may come into contact with it.</p>
<heading level="1" id="h-0004">SUMMARY</heading>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">A roasting utensil holder is provided. The roasting utensil holder includes structure defining a chamber and an opening to the chamber. The roasting utensil holder also includes a plurality of brushes. Each of the brushes includes a respective central shaft having a plurality of bristles mounted thereto and extending substantially radially therefrom. The brushes are mounted to the structure such that the brushes extend across the chamber. A clamp is mounted to the structure.</p>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">The clamp enables the selective attachment of the holder to various objects that may be found around a campfire, such as a picnic table or folding camp chair. The roasting utensil holder is configured such that, when the clamp is engaged with the picnic table, camp chair, etc., the opening to the chamber is facing upward.</p>
<p id="p-0009" num="0008">The opening to the chamber is sufficiently sized such that the food retention portion of a roasting utensil is insertable into the chamber through the opening. The central shafts of the brushes and the structure defining the chamber cooperate to limit lateral movement of the food retention portion such that the utensils are maintained in a substantially upright (i.e., vertical) position.</p>
<p id="p-0010" num="0009">The bristles extend through the space within the chamber between the central shafts and the structure; insertion of the food retention portion of the utensil into the chamber causes contact between the bristles and the food retention portion, thereby causing the bristles to scour the food retention portion and remove unwanted food residue. In one embodiment, the structure is formed by two pieces that are detachable from one another to expose the brushes for even more effective scouring of the utensils.</p>
<p id="p-0011" num="0010">Accordingly, the roasting utensil holder provides a secure and stable place to store roasting utensils when not in use, and also provides a way to clean the roasting utensils.</p>
<p id="p-0012" num="0011">A corresponding method of use is also provided.</p>
<p id="p-0013" num="0012">The above features and advantages and other features and advantages of the present disclosure are readily apparent from the following detailed description of the best modes for carrying out the disclosure when taken in connection with the accompanying drawings.</p>

<heading level="1" id="h-0006">DETAILED DESCRIPTION</heading>
<p id="p-0024" num="0023">Referring to the Figures, wherein like reference numbers refer to like components throughout, a holder <b>10</b> for use with roasting utensils <b>14</b> is schematically depicted. The holder <b>10</b> includes structure <b>18</b> that defines an open space, which, in the embodiment depicted, is a chamber <b>22</b> having an opening <b>26</b>. More specifically, in the embodiment depicted, the structure <b>18</b> has five walls <b>30</b>A, <b>30</b>B, <b>30</b>C, <b>30</b>D, <b>30</b>E.</p>
<p id="p-0025" num="0024">Walls <b>30</b>A and <b>30</b>B are substantially parallel to one another; walls <b>30</b>C and <b>30</b>D are substantially parallel to one another and perpendicular to walls <b>30</b>A and <b>30</b>B; and wall <b>30</b>E is perpendicular to walls <b>30</b>A, <b>30</b>B, <b>30</b>C, and <b>30</b>D. Walls <b>30</b>C, <b>30</b>D, and <b>30</b>E extend between, and interconnect, walls <b>30</b>A and <b>30</b>B. The walls 30A-E cooperate to define the chamber <b>22</b>. The structure <b>18</b> as shown in the Figures is in the shape of a rectangular prism, though other shapes and structure configurations may be employed within the scope of the claimed invention. The opening <b>26</b> to the chamber <b>22</b> is directly opposite wall <b>30</b>E.</p>
<p id="p-0026" num="0025">The holder <b>10</b> includes a plurality of brushes <b>34</b>. Each of the brushes <b>34</b> includes a respective central shaft <b>38</b> and a plurality of bristles <b>42</b> that are connected to the central shaft <b>38</b> such that the bristles <b>42</b> extend radially outward from the shaft <b>38</b>. The brushes <b>34</b> are mounted to the structure <b>18</b> such that the brushes <b>34</b> extend across the chamber <b>22</b>. In the embodiment depicted, each of the central shafts <b>38</b> extends from wall <b>30</b>C to wall <b>30</b>D such that the central shafts <b>38</b> are parallel to one another. In the embodiment depicted, the brushes <b>34</b> are mounted to the walls <b>30</b>C, <b>30</b>D with threaded fasteners <b>44</b> that extend through holes in the walls and the central shafts, though any method of mounting the brushes <b>34</b> to the structure <b>18</b> may be employed within the scope of the claimed invention.</p>
<p id="p-0027" num="0026">In the embodiment depicted, the structure <b>18</b> is formed from two segments <b>46</b>, <b>50</b> to assist in assembly of the holder <b>10</b>. The segments <b>46</b>, <b>50</b> are also selectively separable to facilitate access to the brushes <b>34</b> for cleaning. More specifically, segment <b>46</b> includes wall <b>30</b>A and half of walls <b>30</b>C, <b>30</b>D, <b>30</b>E. Segment <b>50</b> includes wall <b>30</b>B and half of walls <b>30</b>C, <b>30</b>D, <b>30</b>E. The segments <b>46</b>, <b>50</b> are separable as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b></figref> to make the brushes <b>34</b> more accessible.</p>
<p id="p-0028" num="0027">The holder <b>10</b> includes a fastening system to fasten the segments <b>46</b>, <b>50</b> together to form the chamber <b>22</b>. In the embodiment depicted, the fastening system includes a threaded rod <b>54</b> that is attached to segment <b>50</b> at wall <b>30</b>B. A hole <b>58</b> in wall <b>30</b>A is positioned so that the rod <b>54</b> extends therethrough when the segments <b>46</b>, <b>50</b> are positioned to form the rectangular prism, as best seen in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b></figref>; a nut <b>62</b> having internal threads is engageable with the threaded rod <b>54</b> and contacts the wall <b>30</b>A, thereby connecting the segments <b>46</b>, <b>50</b>. It should be noted that other fastening systems to releasably connect the segments <b>46</b>, <b>50</b> may be employed within the scope of the claimed invention.</p>
<p id="p-0029" num="0028">It should be noted that, in the embodiment depicted and as best shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>4</b> and <b>5</b></figref>, a first set <b>64</b> of brushes <b>34</b> is connected to the portions of the walls <b>30</b>C, <b>30</b>D that are formed by segment <b>46</b>, and a second set <b>65</b> of brushes is connected to the portions of the walls <b>30</b>C, <b>30</b>D that are formed by segment <b>50</b>. Thus, each segment <b>46</b>, <b>50</b> has a respective set <b>64</b>, <b>65</b> of brushes <b>34</b> mounted thereto. The central shafts <b>38</b> of the first set <b>64</b> of brushes <b>34</b> are parallel to one another and coplanar on a first plane <b>66</b> that is parallel to walls <b>30</b>A, <b>30</b>B. The central shafts <b>38</b> of the second set <b>65</b> of brushes <b>34</b> are parallel to one another and coplanar on a second plane <b>68</b> that is parallel to plane <b>66</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0030" num="0029">The holder <b>10</b> includes a clamp assembly <b>70</b> that is mounted to the structure <b>18</b>. The clamp assembly <b>70</b> is configured to removably attach the holder <b>10</b> to various outdoor objects or furniture that may be at a campsite or near a campfire, including, but not limited to, a picnic table <b>74</b>, the leg <b>78</b> of a portable camp chair <b>82</b>, etc. The clamp assembly <b>70</b> may be any type of clamp suitable for releasably attaching the holder <b>10</b> to a picnic table top <b>74</b>, a cylindrical camp chair leg, etc. within the scope of the claimed invention. The clamp assembly <b>70</b> is selectively rotatable relative to the structure <b>18</b> and the brushes <b>34</b> so that the clamp assembly <b>70</b> can engage objects of various shapes and orientations while maintaining the structure <b>18</b> in a position in which the opening <b>26</b> is at the top of the structure <b>18</b> and the chamber <b>22</b> is upwardly open, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>6</b>-<b>8</b></figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0031" num="0030">A method of using the holder <b>10</b> may include operatively connecting segments <b>46</b>, <b>50</b> to one another so that they cooperate to form a rectangular prism and define chamber <b>22</b>, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>1</b>-<b>4</b> and <b>6</b>-<b>8</b></figref>. Operatively connecting the segments <b>46</b>, <b>50</b> may include extending the threaded rod <b>54</b> that is attached to segment <b>50</b> through the hole <b>58</b> in wall <b>30</b>A, and then engaging nut <b>62</b> with the threaded rod <b>54</b> so that the nut <b>62</b> contacts the wall <b>30</b>A.</p>
<p id="p-0032" num="0031">The method also includes using the clamp assembly <b>70</b> to attach the holder <b>10</b> to an object at a campsite or near a campfire, and, more specifically, to cause the assembly <b>70</b> to clamp, i.e., exert compressive clamping forces on, the object. The object may be a picnic table <b>74</b>, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>6</b> and <b>7</b></figref>, or the leg <b>78</b> of a camp chair <b>82</b>, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>8</b></figref>. The method may also include rotating the structure <b>18</b> (and the brushes <b>34</b> mounted thereto) relative to the clamp assembly <b>70</b> so that the opening <b>26</b> to the chamber <b>22</b> is at the top of the structure <b>18</b> and the chamber <b>22</b> is open and unobstructed from above.</p>
<p id="p-0033" num="0032">The method further includes inserting the food retention portion of a roasting utensil <b>14</b> through the opening <b>26</b> and into the chamber <b>22</b>, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>7</b> and <b>8</b></figref>. In the embodiment depicted, the utensil <b>14</b> includes a shaft <b>86</b>, and the food retention portion attached at one end of the shaft <b>86</b> is a fork having two prongs <b>90</b>, <b>94</b>; each prong <b>90</b>, <b>94</b> has a respective terminal end <b>95</b>, <b>96</b> that is tapered to form a conical tip. A grip or handle (not shown) is mounted to, or integral with, the shaft <b>86</b> at the end opposite the prongs <b>90</b>, <b>94</b> as understood by those skilled in the art.</p>
<p id="p-0034" num="0033">When the prongs <b>90</b>, <b>94</b> have been sufficiently inserted into the chamber <b>22</b>, the bristles <b>42</b>, the shafts <b>38</b>, and/or the walls <b>30</b>A, <b>30</b>B will prevent or restrict lateral movement of the prongs <b>90</b>, <b>94</b>, which will maintain the shaft <b>86</b>, which remains outside the chamber <b>22</b>, in a substantially upright, vertical position. More specifically, the bristles <b>42</b>, shafts <b>38</b>, and/or walls <b>30</b>A, <b>30</b>B act on the prongs <b>90</b>A, <b>90</b>B to prevent the utensil <b>14</b> from falling to a horizontal position. This upright position of the shaft <b>86</b> provides efficient storage of the utensils <b>14</b> until they are ready to use.</p>
<p id="p-0035" num="0034">The use of two sets <b>64</b>, <b>65</b> of brushes enables the storage of a plurality of utensils <b>14</b>, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>8</b></figref>. Referring specifically to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>8</b></figref>, the prongs <b>90</b>, <b>94</b> of a first utensil <b>14</b> are between wall <b>30</b>A and the shafts <b>38</b> of the first set <b>64</b> of brushes <b>34</b>; the wall <b>30</b>A and the first set <b>64</b> of brushes <b>34</b> restrict movement of the prongs <b>90</b>, <b>94</b> of the first utensil <b>14</b>. The prongs <b>90</b>, <b>94</b> of a second utensil <b>14</b> are between wall <b>30</b>B and the shafts <b>38</b> of the second set <b>65</b> of brushes <b>34</b>; the wall <b>30</b>B and the second set <b>65</b> of brushes <b>34</b> restrict movement of the prongs <b>90</b>, <b>94</b> of the second utensil <b>14</b>. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>7</b></figref>, the prongs <b>90</b>, <b>94</b> of a utensil <b>14</b> are also insertable between the first and second sets <b>64</b>, <b>65</b> of brushes <b>34</b> such that the shafts <b>38</b> of the two sets <b>64</b>, <b>65</b> of brushes restrict lateral movement of the utensil. Accordingly, in the embodiment depicted, the holder <b>10</b> can store at least three utensils <b>14</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0036" num="0035">As the prongs <b>90</b>, <b>94</b> move through the chamber <b>22</b>, the bristles <b>42</b> scour the prongs <b>90</b>, <b>94</b>, thereby removing food residue. The method may include moving the utensils <b>14</b> up and down repeatedly to increase the scouring action.</p>
<p id="p-0037" num="0036">The method may also include separating the segments <b>46</b>, <b>50</b> as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b></figref> to expose the brushes <b>34</b> for cleaning the brushes <b>34</b>. It should be noted that the structure <b>18</b> may have other configurations within the scope of the claimed invention. For example, the walls <b>30</b>A, <b>30</b>B, <b>30</b>C, <b>30</b>D may have holes to reduce the weight of the holder <b>10</b> or to facilitate the removal of water or residue from the chamber <b>22</b>. In one embodiment, the bristles <b>42</b> are metal.</p>
<p id="p-0038" num="0037">It should be noted that the clamp assembly <b>70</b> is shown highly schematically in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>1</b>-<b>5</b></figref>. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>9</b> and <b>10</b></figref> schematically depict the clamp assembly <b>70</b>. Clamp assembly <b>70</b> includes first and second jaw members <b>98</b>, <b>102</b> that are pivotably connected to each other via a pivot pin <b>106</b>. More specifically, jaw member <b>98</b> includes an end <b>110</b> that is proximate to the pivot pin <b>106</b>, an end <b>114</b> that is distal relative to the pin <b>106</b>, and a concave surface <b>116</b> between the ends <b>110</b>, <b>114</b>. Similarly, jaw member <b>102</b> includes an end <b>118</b> proximate to the pin <b>106</b>, another end <b>122</b> distal to the pivot pin <b>106</b>, and a concave surface <b>124</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0039" num="0038">Surfaces <b>116</b>, <b>124</b> generally face each other. The distance between surfaces <b>116</b>, <b>124</b>, and the distance between ends <b>114</b>, <b>122</b>, are variable by causing jaw member <b>98</b> to rotate relative to jaw member <b>102</b> about the pivot pin <b>106</b>. Accordingly, a compressive clamping force is exertable by the jaw members <b>98</b>, <b>102</b> on an object located between the surfaces <b>116</b>, <b>124</b>, or between the ends <b>114</b>, <b>122</b>, as understood by those skilled in the art.</p>
<p id="p-0040" num="0039">The clamp assembly <b>70</b> includes a thumb screw <b>128</b> having external threads. The thumb screw <b>128</b> extends through a hole in the first jaw member <b>98</b> having internal threads. The external threads and the internal threads engage each other such that rotation of the thumb screw <b>128</b> causes rotation of the first jaw member <b>98</b> about the pivot pin <b>106</b> and relative to the second jaw member. Thus, a user of the holder <b>10</b> attaches the holder <b>10</b> to an object, e.g., the picnic table or camp chair, by positioning the object between the jaw members <b>98</b>, <b>102</b> when the jaw members <b>98</b>, <b>102</b> are in an open position as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>9</b></figref>, and turning the thumbscrew <b>128</b> until a sufficient compressive clamping force is exerted on the object. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>10</b></figref> depicts the clamp assembly with the jaw members <b>98</b>, <b>102</b> fully closed.</p>
<p id="p-0041" num="0040">The surfaces <b>116</b>, <b>124</b> may have a high-friction coating applied thereto to prevent the holder <b>10</b> from sliding along the object to which it is attached. In the embodiment depicted, end <b>114</b> is bifurcated into two prongs <b>132</b>, <b>136</b>. When the jaw members <b>98</b>, <b>102</b> are fully closed, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>10</b></figref>, the end <b>122</b> of jaw member <b>102</b> extends between the prongs <b>132</b>, <b>136</b> of jaw member <b>98</b> to permit the surfaces <b>116</b>, <b>124</b> to be closer together.</p>
<p id="p-0042" num="0041">Although a thumb screw style clamp assembly <b>70</b> is shown and described, it should be noted that any clamp configuration suitable for attaching the holder <b>10</b> to an object may be employed within the scope of the claimed invention.</p>
<p id="p-0043" num="0042">The clamp assembly <b>70</b> is connected to the structure <b>18</b> via a shaft <b>140</b>. The clamp assembly <b>70</b> is selectively pivotable about the shaft <b>140</b> such that the orientation of the clamp assembly <b>70</b> can be altered while maintaining the structure <b>18</b> so that the chamber <b>22</b> is upwardly-open. For example, and with reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>6</b> and <b>7</b></figref>, the picnic table top <b>74</b> has first and second horizontal surfaces <b>144</b>, <b>148</b>. Surface <b>144</b> faces upward and surface <b>148</b> faces downward, as understood by those skilled in the art. The clamp assembly <b>70</b> is positioned such that one jaw member <b>98</b> contacts the lower surface <b>148</b> and the other jaw member <b>102</b> contacts the upper surface <b>144</b>. Thus, the jaw members <b>98</b>, <b>102</b> are coplanar about a vertical plane.</p>
<p id="p-0044" num="0043">However, the orientation of the clamp assembly <b>70</b> shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>6</b> and <b>7</b></figref> will not permit the clamp assembly <b>70</b> to clamp onto a vertically-oriented cylinder, such as the leg <b>78</b> of the camp chair <b>82</b> as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>8</b></figref>. A user may rotate the clamp assembly <b>70</b> relative to the structure <b>18</b> such that the jaw members <b>98</b>, <b>102</b> are coplanar about a horizontal plane so that the cylindrical outer surface of the leg <b>78</b> may be clamped between the jaw members <b>98</b>, <b>102</b>. The clamp assembly <b>70</b> in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>8</b></figref> is rotated ninety degrees relative to the structure <b>18</b> from its position in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>6</b> and <b>7</b></figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0045" num="0044">A mechanism may be employed to selectively lock the clamp assembly <b>70</b> relative to the structure <b>18</b> once the clamp assembly <b>70</b> is in its desired rotational position.</p>
<p id="p-0046" num="0045">While the best modes for carrying out the disclosure have been described in detail, those familiar with the art to which this disclosure relates will recognize various alternative designs and embodiments for practicing the disclosure within the scope of the appended claims.</p>
