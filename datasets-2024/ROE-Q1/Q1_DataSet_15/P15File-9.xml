<?summary-of-invention description="Summary of Invention" end="lead"?>
<p id="p-0002" num="0001">The present invention relates to an aerosol-generating device with an elongate housing having a distal end and a proximal end, with a light source, and a control unit configured for controlling the light source. The proximal end of the housing comprises an illumination portion made from translucent material and the light source is optically coupled to the illumination portion. The present invention also relates to an aerosol-generating system comprising the aerosol-generating device and a method for operating the aerosol-generating system.</p>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">Visual indication means are frequently used in electronic aerosol-generating devices to visually provide information to the user. Existing aerosol-generating devices comprising different types of displays in their lateral surfaces are known in the art.</p>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">Currently used visual indication means are provided at positions of the aerosol-generating devices that cannot be easily observed during the user experience. Since such visual indication means are usually provided at the sides of the housing of the aerosol-generating device, the aerosol-generating device may have to be turned around to be inspected. Such handling may be perceived as cumbersome by the consumers.</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">It is also known to provide end faces that in use point away from the consumer with illuminated portions. Typically, such illuminated portions are used in order to mimic the glow of a conventional cigarette.</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">It would be desirable to provide an aerosol-generating device having a visual feedback means that can conveniently be checked during the user experience.</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">It would further be desirable to provide an aerosol-generating device having a visual feedback means that may guide the user before, during and after the user experience.</p>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">It would be further desirable to provide an aerosol-generating device with a feedback means that has a low power consumption and at the same time has a high visual perceptibility.</p>
<p id="p-0009" num="0008">According to an embodiment of the present invention there is provided an aerosol-generating device comprising an elongate housing having a distal end and a proximal end, a light source, and a control unit configured for controlling the light source. The proximal end of the housing comprises an illumination portion made from translucent material. The light source is optically coupled to the illumination portion.The aerosol-generating device may be configured to receive an aerosol-generating article. The illumination portion may be configured to surround the aerosol-generating article in use.</p>
<p id="p-0010" num="0009">As used herein, an &#x2018;aerosol-generating device&#x2019; relates to a device that interacts with an aerosol-forming substrate to generate an aerosol. The aerosol-forming substrate may be part of an aerosol-generating article. An aerosol-generating device may be a device that interacts with an aerosol-forming substrate of an aerosol-generating article. An aerosol-generating device may be a holder. The aerosol-generating device may be an electrically heated aerosol-generating device. The aerosol-generating device may comprise one or more of a housing, electric circuitry, a power supply, a heating chamber and a heating element. The housing may define a cavity that comprises the heating chamber having an open end at the proximal end of the aerosol-generating device, and the heating element. The heating chamber may be configured for insertion of an aerosol-generating article. The heating element may be part of the aerosol-generating article.</p>
<p id="p-0011" num="0010">The aerosol-generating device is preferably a portable or handheld device that is comfortable to hold between the fingers of a single hand. The device may be substantially cylindrical in shape and may have a length of between 30 and 150 millimetres. The maximum diameter of the device is preferably between 5 and 30 millimetres.</p>
<p id="p-0012" num="0011">The housing of the aerosol-generating device may be elongate. The housing may comprise any suitable material or combination of materials. Examples of suitable materials include metals, alloys, plastics or composite materials containing one or more of those materials, or thermoplastics that are suitable for food or pharmaceutical applications, for example polypropylene, polyetheretherketone (PEEK) and polyethylene. Preferably, the material is light and non-brittle.</p>
<p id="p-0013" num="0012">The housing may comprise a mouthpiece. The housing may comprise at least one air inlet. The housing may comprise more than one air inlet. The mouthpiece may comprise at least one air inlet and at least one air outlet. The mouthpiece may comprise more than one air inlet. One or more of the air inlets may reduce the temperature of the aerosol before it is delivered to a user and may reduce the concentration of the aerosol before it is delivered to a user.</p>
<p id="p-0014" num="0013">As used herein, the term &#x2018;mouthpiece&#x2019; refers to a portion of an aerosol-generating device that during a puff is closest to the user's mouth.</p>
<p id="p-0015" num="0014">The aerosol-generating device may include a sensor to activate the aerosol-generating device. The aerosol-generating device may include a user interface to activate the aerosol-generating device, for example a button to initiate heating of the aerosol-generating device or display to indicate a state of the aerosol-generating device or of the aerosol-forming substrate.</p>
<p id="p-0016" num="0015">As used herein, the term &#x2018;user experience&#x2019; refers to the act of consuming an aerosol-generating article. A user experience may include one or more consecutive puffs. The user experience also includes the time period in between puffs.</p>
<p id="p-0017" num="0016">As light source of the aerosol-generating device any known light source with low power consumption may be used. Suitable light sources include light emitting diodes (LED), micro LEDs or organic LEDs (OLED) devices. These light sources have low power consumption. The addition of a the light source with low power consumption advantageously puts only a very small load on the power source of an existing aerosol-generating device, preferably with only very limited effect on the design of the existing power source. This is particularly advantageous for portable devices in which capacity of the power source is limited and excess power consumption is to be avoided.</p>
<p id="p-0018" num="0017">The light source may be capable of displaying monochromatic or multi-coloured light. A light source that is capable of displaying multi-coloured light may be controlled to emit a plurality of colours of light. Multi-coloured light sources are advantageous in that a single light source can be used to create a plurality of illumination effects. This may help to reduce the overall number of electronic components to be used in the aerosol-generating device. This may also reduce design complexity and may reduce the total manufacturing cost of the aerosol-generating device.</p>
<p id="p-0019" num="0018">In use of the aerosol-generating device the proximal end of the housing, which comprises the illumination portion, may point towards the consumer. The housing of the aerosol-generating device may define a cavity with an open end at the proximal end of the housing. The cavity may be configured to receive an aerosol-generating article.</p>
<p id="p-0020" num="0019">The proximal end of the housing is the end at which the mouthpiece is provided. During a puff the user puts the mouthpiece into or close to the user's mouth.</p>
<p id="p-0021" num="0020">The proximal end may have a proximal end face that faces to the user during the user experience. The proximal end face may comprise the illumination portion.</p>
<p id="p-0022" num="0021">Accordingly, in particular in use of the aerosol-generating device, the proximal end of the housing and under normal handling conditions the proximal end of the aerosol-generating device is in the field of view of the user. The illumination portion provided at the proximal end of the aerosol-generating device is therefore highly visible to the user in use of the device and also during the user experience. The illumination portion is particularly visible to the user in between puffs of a user experience.</p>
<p id="p-0023" num="0022">For this reason, the illumination portion may be advantageously used to indicate useful information to the user. Such information may pertain to the various operation status of the aerosol-generation device. The illumination portion may also be used to indicate a progress of a specific operation or information regarding the user experience.</p>
<p id="p-0024" num="0023">The aerosol-generating device may comprise a retaining element. The retaining element may form the illumination portion at the proximal end of the housing of the aerosol-generating device. The retaining element may be provided at the opening of the cavity formed at the proximal end of the housing of the aerosol-generating device.</p>
<p id="p-0025" num="0024">The retaining element may have generally ring-shaped form. The outer diameter of the retaining element may correspond to the dimensions of the housing of the aerosol-generating device. The outer circumferential edge of the retaining element may be mounted to the housing of the aerosol-generating device.</p>
<p id="p-0026" num="0025">The inner diameter of the retaining element may define the opening of the cavity. The inner diameter of the retaining element may have a dimension that corresponds to the diameter of the aerosol-generating article that is to be inserted into the cavity. The retaining element may assure correct placement of the aerosol-generating article in the cavity. In particular, the retaining element may ensure that the aerosol-generating article is correctly inserted in the centre of the cavity.</p>
<p id="p-0027" num="0026">The retaining element may be made from any suitable material. The retaining element may be made from an elastic material. The retaining element is made from elastic, translucent polymer material such as, for example, poly(amide-imide), liquid silicone rubber (LSR), polyvinyl chloride (PVC). Retaining elements made from such elastic materials may be dimensioned such that their inner diameter corresponds exactly or is slightly smaller than the outer diameter of the aerosol-generating article that is to be inserted into the cavity. The retaining element may be formed such that it has physical contact with the outer circumference of the aerosol-generating article that is inserted into the cavity. In this way the retaining element may assure retention of the aerosol-generating article in the cavity. Moreover, the retaining element may sealingly engage with the outer circumference of the aerosol-generating article in the cavity. In use of the aerosol-generating device the retaining element may reduce air flow into the heating chamber through its open end.</p>
<p id="p-0028" num="0027">The retaining element may be made from transparent or translucent material. The retaining element may be optically coupled to the light source of the aerosol-generating device. By coupling the retaining element optically to the light source, the retaining element may be illuminated by the light source. When the light source is configured to generate a plurality of different colours, the retaining element can accordingly appear in a number of different colours.</p>
<p id="p-0029" num="0028">The light source can be integrated in the opening of the cavity of the device and in close proximity of the retaining element. The light source may be provided in a circumferential recess at the opening of the cavity. The light source may have a ring-shaped form that may be integrated in the opening of the cavity of the device and in close proximity of the retaining element. The light source may be located directly adjacent to the retaining element. The light source may be located directly adjacent to the outer circumference of the retaining element. By providing the light source close to the translucent retaining element, the light can be efficiently coupled into the material of the retaining element.</p>
<p id="p-0030" num="0029">The aerosol-generating device may be an electrically heated aerosol-generating device. The aerosol-generating device may be configured to resistively heat the aerosol-generating article.</p>
<p id="p-0031" num="0030">The aerosol-generating device may be configured to inductively heat the aerosol-generating article. The aerosol-generating device may comprise an induction heating element. The induction heating element may comprise an induction coil. The induction heating element may comprise a susceptor. The induction coil is capable of generating an alternating magnetic field. This alternating magnetic field penetrates the susceptor and thereby generates heat due to eddy currents and or hysteresis losses within the susceptor.</p>
<p id="p-0032" num="0031">The susceptor may be formed from any material that can be inductively heated to a temperature sufficient to generate an aerosol from the aerosol-forming substrate. A preferred susceptor may comprise or consist of a ferromagnetic material or ferri-magnetic material, for example a ferromagnetic alloy, ferritic iron, or a ferromagnetic steel or stainless steel. A suitable susceptor may be, or comprise, aluminum. Preferred susceptors may be heated to a temperature in excess of 250 degrees Celsius.</p>
<p id="p-0033" num="0032">When an induction heating element is employed, the induction heating element may be configured as an internal heating element as described herein or as an external heater as described herein. If the induction heating element is configured as an internal heating element, the susceptor element is preferably configured as a pin or blade for penetrating the aerosol-generating article. If the induction heating element is configured as an external heating element, the susceptor element is preferably configured as a cylindrical susceptor at least partly surrounding the cavity or forming the sidewall of the cavity.</p>
<p id="p-0034" num="0033">The susceptor may also be provided within or as a part of the aerosol-forming article.</p>
<p id="p-0035" num="0034">The aerosol-generating device comprises a control unit that is configured to control the operation of the aerosol-generating device. The control unit may be configured to control the heating element of the aerosol-generating device.</p>
<p id="p-0036" num="0035">The control unit may be configured to control the light source of the aerosol-generating device. The control unit may be configured to control the light source of the aerosol-generating device based on the detected operation status of the aerosol-generating device.</p>
<p id="p-0037" num="0036">Controlling the light source based on an operation status of the aerosol-generating device may include changing colour, brightness or operational mode of the light source. The operational mode of the light source may include continuous light mode, blinking mode or flashing mode.</p>
<p id="p-0038" num="0037">The control unit may detect activation of the aerosol-generating device and may be configured to control the light source to emit a first colour of light to indicate that the aerosol-generating device is activated. The control unit may control the light source to emit white light to indicate that the aerosol-generating device is activated.</p>
<p id="p-0039" num="0038">The control unit may detect that heat-up procedure is started and may be configured to control the light source to emit a second colour of light to indicate that the aerosol-generating device is heating up. The control unit may be configured to control the light source to blink in the second colour to indicate that the process of heating up is currently carried out.</p>
<p id="p-0040" num="0039">The control unit may detect that heat-up procedure has finished and that the aerosol-generating device is ready for the user experience. The control unit may control the light source to emit a further colour of light to indicate that the aerosol-generating device is ready for use. The control unit may control the light source to emit a green colour to indicate that the aerosol-generating device is ready for use.</p>
<p id="p-0041" num="0040">By controlling the light source to changing its lighting status and thereby changing the appearance of the illumination portion, the user can be informed of the operational status of the aerosol-generating device. Since the illumination portion is provided at the proximal end of the housing of the aerosol-generating device, the illumination portion is readily visible to the user during the user experience. Furthermore the illumination portion at the proximal end of the housing of the aerosol-generating device during normal handling of the device is usually not covered by a user's hand, such that the risk of accidentally covering the illumination portion is reduced.</p>
<p id="p-0042" num="0041">The control unit of the aerosol-generating device may be configured to control the light source also based on signals detected from further sensors of the aerosol-generating device.</p>
<p id="p-0043" num="0042">The proximal end of the aerosol-generating device may comprise a proximity sensor for detecting proximity to the consumer's mouth. Based on corresponding signals received from the proximity sensor, the light source may be controlled by the control unit. The control unit may dim the light source during a puff, when the proximity sensor detects proximity to the consumer's mouth. During a puff the user may not be able to observe the proximal end of the aerosol-generating device. In such situation the light source can be temporarily dimmed or switched off to save electric energy of the power source.</p>
<p id="p-0044" num="0043">The aerosol-generating device may comprise a light sensor for detecting the brightness of the ambient environment. The control unit may be configured to adjust the intensity of the light source based on the signals from the light sensor. In this way it can be ensured that during the day at increase surrounding brightness the intensity of the light source is sufficient to be detected by the user. At the same time electric energy may be saved by avoiding unnecessary power consumption by a high intensity of the light source at night or in low light environment.</p>
<p id="p-0045" num="0044">The control unit of the aerosol-generating device may be configured to detect the presence of an aerosol-generating article in the cavity. For this purpose the control unit may be configured to monitor the magnetic field within the heating chamber of the aerosol-generating device. In embodiments in which the aerosol-generating article is inductively heated the change of the magnetic field of the induction coils may be monitored. The control unit may not only determine whether a change of the magnetic field occurs, but may also be configured to determine whether the aerosol-generating article has been inserted correctly. The control unit may also be configured to determine whether the correct aerosol-generating article has been inserted. Aerosol-generating devices are usually configured to co-operate with specific aerosol-generating articles. Thus, a recognition method that is able to verify that the correct aerosol-generating articles are used with the device may help to avoid incorrect use of the aerosol-generating device.</p>
<p id="p-0046" num="0045">The control unit may be configured to control the light source in dependence of the aerosol-generating article recognition. If the control unit detects that a compatible aerosol-generating article has been correctly inserted into the heating chamber of the aerosol-generating device, the light source may be controlled to change to a further different colour to indicate to the user that the aerosol-generating device is ready for use. The control unit may also be configured to automatically start heating when a correct aerosol-generating article has been correctly inserted into the heating chamber of the aerosol-generating device.</p>

The control unit controls the light source based on an operation status of the aerosol-generating device.</p>
<p id="p-0049" num="0048">Controlling the light source based on an operation status of the aerosol-generating device may include changing colour, brightness or the lighting mode of the light source. The operational mode of the light source may include continuous light mode, blinking mode or flashing mode.</p>
<p id="p-0050" num="0049">The control unit may be configured to detect presence of an aerosol-generating article in the cavity and may changes brightness, colour or operational mode of the light source upon detection of the presence of the aerosol-generating article.</p>
<p id="p-0051" num="0050">The control unit may be configured to detect presence of an aerosol-generating article in the cavity by monitoring the magnetic field in the heating chamber. This method is particularly advantageous for aerosol-generating devices that are configured for inductive heating. Such devices are configured to generate a magnetic field in the heating chamber, such that monitoring of the magnetic field can be performed without increasing the complexity of the aerosol-generating device.</p>

In this way the user may be immediately informed should an unexpected situation be detected. Such situation may include for example the detection of an incompatible aerosol-generating article, incorrect insertion of a compatible aerosol-generating article, or detection of an imminent overheating of the heating chamber. In such case, the control unit may switch the light source into a flashing mode. Since the illumination portion is usually within the view field of the user, the user may immediately perceive the warning signal.</p>
<p id="p-0055" num="0054">The aerosol generating device may be configured to perform a cleaning procedure of the heating chamber. The cleaning procedure may include heating the heating chamber to increased temperatures. The control unit may be configured to control the light source to emit a corresponding visual signal to inform the user that a cleaning procedure is in operation.</p>
<p id="p-0056" num="0055">Thanks to the good visibility of the illumination portion at the proximal end of the aerosol-generating device, the user is guided and informed before, during and after the user experience. In this way the overall user experience is enhanced.</p>
<p id="p-0057" num="0056">A user may be able to customize the aerosol-generating device by adapting the light control according to personal preferences. Customization may be done by connecting the aerosol generating device to a personal computer, a smart phone or any other suitable input device.

The aerosol-generating device <b>12</b> comprises an elongate housing <b>16</b> having a distal end <b>18</b> and a proximal end <b>20</b>. The housing defines a main portion <b>22</b> and a heating portion <b>24</b>. In the main portion <b>22</b> of the housing <b>16</b> of the aerosol-generating device <b>12</b> there is provided a power source and electric circuitry including a control unit. The power source provides electrical energy to the control unit and all other electronic components of the aerosol-generating device <b>12</b>. An interface portion <b>22</b> is located at the distal end <b>18</b> of the housing <b>16</b>. The interface portion <b>22</b> comprises a charging port for charging the power source.</p>
<p id="p-0086" num="0085">The heating portion <b>24</b> of the housing <b>16</b> defines a cavity <b>26</b> at the proximal end <b>20</b>. The cavity <b>26</b> forms a heating chamber that is configured for receiving and heating the aerosol-generating article <b>14</b>. At the opening of the cavity <b>26</b> at the proximal end <b>20</b> of the housing <b>16</b> there is provided an illumination portion <b>30</b>. The illumination portion <b>30</b> is made from translucent material. The illumination portion <b>30</b> is coupled to a multi-colour light source and is configured to be illuminated in a plurality of colours.</p>
<p id="p-0087" num="0086">In the left view in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref> the aerosol-generating device <b>12</b> is activated and ready for receiving an aerosol-generating article <b>14</b>. As an indication of this operational status, the illumination portion <b>30</b> is illuminated in bright blue colour.</p>
<p id="p-0088" num="0087">In the central view in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref> the aerosol-generating article <b>14</b> is inserted into the cavity <b>26</b> of the aerosol-generating device <b>12</b> and the heating phase is started. As an indication of this operational status, the illumination portion <b>30</b> is illuminated in red colour.</p>
<p id="p-0089" num="0088">In the right view in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref> the heating phase is finished and the aerosol-generating system <b>10</b> is ready for the user experience. As an indication of this operational status, the illumination portion <b>30</b> is illuminated in green colour.</p>
<p id="p-0090" num="0089">A user usually holds the aerosol-generating device <b>12</b> at the central portion of the housing <b>16</b>, leaving the proximal end <b>20</b> uncovered. In normal use of the aerosol-generating device <b>12</b> the proximal end <b>20</b> points towards the user. Accordingly, the proximal end <b>20</b> is usually in the view field of the user and the information conveyed by the colour coding of the illumination portion <b>30</b> is readily perceivable by the user.</p>
<p id="p-0091" num="0090">In the cross-sectional views of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref> more details of the heating chamber can be seen. In this embodiment the aerosol-generating device <b>12</b> is configured for inductive heating. For this purpose the aerosol-generating device <b>12</b> comprises an induction coil <b>32</b> and a susceptor element <b>34</b>. The induction coil <b>32</b> and the susceptor element <b>34</b> are separated by an electrically insulating wall <b>36</b> and are arranged to surround the cavity of aerosol-generating device <b>12</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0092" num="0091">The induction coil <b>32</b> is capable of generating an alternating magnetic field. This alternating magnetic field penetrates the susceptor element <b>34</b> and thereby generates heat.</p>
<p id="p-0093" num="0092">The susceptor element <b>34</b> has a cylindrical shape and has a diameter that substantially corresponds to the outer diameter of the aerosol-generating article <b>14</b>. The susceptor element <b>34</b> is formed from a plurality of susceptor blades. The susceptor blades are configured resilient and firmly contact the aerosol-generating article <b>14</b> after insertion. In this way good thermal contact between the susceptor element <b>34</b> and the aerosol-generating article <b>24</b> is ensured.</p>
<p id="p-0094" num="0093">The opening of the cavity <b>26</b> at the proximal end <b>20</b> of the housing <b>16</b> there is provided a ring shaped retaining element <b>38</b> made from elastic and translucent polymer material. In this case the retaining element <b>38</b> is made from polyvinyl chloride. The retaining element forms the illumination portion of the aerosol-generating device <b>12</b>. The retaining element <b>38</b> defines the opening of the cavity <b>26</b> and has an inner diameter that corresponds to the outer diameter aerosol-generating article <b>14</b>. The funnel shape of the retaining element <b>38</b> allows for guided and easy insertion of the aerosol-generating article <b>14</b> into the heating chamber.</p>
<p id="p-0095" num="0094">A light source <b>40</b> is optically coupled to the retaining element <b>38</b>. The light source <b>40</b> is an OLED device that is capable of emitting a plurality of colours. The light source <b>40</b> is located in a circumferential recess in the housing <b>16</b> adjacent to the outer circumference of the retaining element <b>38</b>. Since the retaining element <b>38</b> is made from translucent material, the retaining element <b>38</b> appears in the colour that is emitted from the light source.</p>
<p id="p-0096" num="0095">When the aerosol-generating device <b>12</b> is turned off, the light source <b>40</b> is deactivated, and the retaining element <b>30</b> appears in the natural colour of its material. When the aerosol-generating device <b>12</b> is activated, but an aerosol-generating article <b>14</b> is not yet inserted, the light source <b>40</b> is controlled to emit bright blue light, to inform the user that the aerosol-generating device <b>12</b> is activated.</p>
<p id="p-0097" num="0096">In the embodiment of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref>, the aerosol-generating device <b>12</b> is configured for monitoring the magnetic field within the heating chamber. If the aerosol-generating article <b>14</b> is inserted into the heating chamber, the control unit detects a change of the magnetic field. If the change of the magnetic field corresponds to an expected change upon correct insertion of a compatible aerosol-generating article <b>14</b>, the light source <b>40</b> is switched to emit green pulsing light. This optical feedback confirms the user of correct handling of the aerosol-generating system <b>10</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0098" num="0097">The control unit is further configured to automatically start the heating phase after a designated time of three seconds after insertion of the aerosol-generating article <b>14</b>. During the heating phase the light source <b>40</b> is switched to emit orange pulsing light.</p>
<p id="p-0099" num="0098">When the heating phase is completed, the control unit switches the colour of the light source <b>40</b> from orange pulsing to a continuous green light to inform the user that the aerosol-generating system <b>10</b> is ready for the user experience.</p>
<p id="p-0100" num="0099">If the control unit of the aerosol-generating device <b>12</b> detects upon monitoring of the magnetic field, that an aerosol-generating article <b>14</b> is wrongly inserted or that an incompatible aerosol-generating article <b>14</b> is inserted, the control unit controls the light source <b>40</b> to emit red flashing light. At the same time normal operation of aerosol-generating system <b>10</b> is interrupted until correct insertion of the aerosol-generating article <b>14</b> is established.</p>
