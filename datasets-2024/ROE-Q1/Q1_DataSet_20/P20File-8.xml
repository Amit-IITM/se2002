<p id="p-0003" num="0002">Example embodiments relate to an aerosol-generating device comprising a waterproof housing, and aerosol-generating systems comprising the aerosol-generating device. At least some example embodiments are also applicable as an electrically operated aerosol-generating device.</p>
<heading id="h-0004" level="1">Description of Related Art</heading>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">One type of aerosol-generating system is an electrically operated aerosol-generating system. Known handheld electrically operated aerosol-generating systems typically comprise an aerosol-generating device comprising a battery, control electronics, and an electric heater for heating an aerosol-generating article designed specifically for use with the aerosol-generating device. In some systems, the aerosol-generating article comprises an aerosol-generating substrate, such as a tobacco rod or a tobacco plug, and the heater contained within the aerosol-generating device is inserted into or around the aerosol-generating substrate when the aerosol-generating article is inserted into the aerosol-generating device. In other electrically operated aerosol-generating systems, the aerosol-generating article may comprise a capsule containing an aerosol-generating substrate, such as loose tobacco.</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">Typically, an aerosol-generating device is reusable with a plurality of disposable or refillable aerosol-generating articles. Therefore, the purchase of an aerosol-generating device may represent a larger consumer investment when compared to the purchase of a single aerosol-generating article.</p>
<heading id="h-0005" level="1">SUMMARY</heading>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">An aerosol-generating device may comprise a housing defining at least one internal compartment. The housing may be waterproof with regard to the at least one internal compartment. A power supply may be positioned within the at least one internal compartment. In addition, an electric heater may be positioned within the at least one internal compartment. Furthermore, a haptic feedback device may be positioned within the at least one internal compartment.</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">An aerosol-generating system may comprise an aerosol-generating device and an aerosol-generating article. The aerosol-generating article may include a storage portion and an aerosol-forming substrate within the storage portion. The electric heater of the aerosol-generating device may be configured to heat the aerosol-forming substrate during an operation of the aerosol-generating system. For example, the housing of the aerosol-generating device may further define a cavity configured to receive the aerosol-generating article. The electric heater of the aerosol-generating device may be configured to heat the aerosol-forming substrate when the aerosol-generating article is received within the cavity.</p>

<heading id="h-0007" level="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION</heading>
<p id="p-0012" num="0011">It should be understood that when an element or layer is referred to as being &#x201c;on,&#x201d; &#x201c;connected to,&#x201d; &#x201c;coupled to,&#x201d; or &#x201c;covering&#x201d; another element or layer, it may be directly on, connected to, coupled to, or covering the other element or layer or intervening elements or layers may be present. In contrast, when an element is referred to as being &#x201c;directly on,&#x201d; &#x201c;directly connected to,&#x201d; or &#x201c;directly coupled to&#x201d; another element or layer, there are no intervening elements or layers present. Like numbers refer to like elements throughout the specification. As used herein, the term &#x201c;and/or&#x201d; includes any and all combinations of one or more of the associated listed items.</p>
<p id="p-0013" num="0012">It should be understood that, although the terms first, second, third, etc. may be used herein to describe various elements, components, regions, layers and/or sections, these elements, components, regions, layers, and/or sections should not be limited by these terms. These terms are only used to distinguish one element, component, region, layer, or section from another region, layer, or section. Thus, a first element, component, region, layer, or section discussed below could be termed a second element, component, region, layer, or section without departing from the teachings of example embodiments.</p>
<p id="p-0014" num="0013">Spatially relative terms (e.g., &#x201c;beneath,&#x201d; &#x201c;below,&#x201d; &#x201c;lower,&#x201d; &#x201c;above,&#x201d; &#x201c;upper,&#x201d; and the like) may be used herein for ease of description to describe one element or feature's relationship to another element(s) or feature(s) as illustrated in the figures. It should be understood that the spatially relative terms are intended to encompass different orientations of the device in use or operation in addition to the orientation depicted in the figures. For example, if the device in the figures is turned over, elements described as &#x201c;below&#x201d; or &#x201c;beneath&#x201d; other elements or features would then be oriented &#x201c;above&#x201d; the other elements or features. Thus, the term &#x201c;below&#x201d; may encompass both an orientation of above and below. The device may be otherwise oriented (rotated 90 degrees or at other orientations) and the spatially relative descriptors used herein interpreted accordingly.</p>
<p id="p-0015" num="0014">The terminology used herein is for the purpose of describing various embodiments only and is not intended to be limiting of example embodiments. As used herein, the singular forms &#x201c;a,&#x201d; &#x201c;an,&#x201d; and &#x201c;the&#x201d; are intended to include the plural forms as well, unless the context clearly indicates otherwise. It will be further understood that the terms &#x201c;includes,&#x201d; &#x201c;including,&#x201d; &#x201c;comprises,&#x201d; and/or &#x201c;comprising,&#x201d; when used in this specification, specify the presence of stated features, integers, steps, operations, elements, and/or components, but do not preclude the presence or addition of one or more other features, integers, steps, operations, elements, components, and/or groups thereof.</p>
<p id="p-0016" num="0015">Example embodiments are described herein with reference to cross-sectional illustrations that are schematic illustrations of idealized embodiments (and intermediate structures) of example embodiments. As such, variations from the shapes of the illustrations as a result, for example, of manufacturing techniques and/or tolerances, are to be expected. Thus, example embodiments should not be construed as limited to the shapes of regions illustrated herein but are to include deviations in shapes that result, for example, from manufacturing.</p>
<p id="p-0017" num="0016">Unless otherwise defined, all terms (including technical and scientific terms) used herein have the same meaning as commonly understood by one of ordinary skill in the art to which example embodiments belong. It will be further understood that terms, including those defined in commonly used dictionaries, should be interpreted as having a meaning that is consistent with their meaning in the context of the relevant art and will not be interpreted in an idealized or overly formal sense unless expressly so defined herein.</p>
<p id="p-0018" num="0017">According to an example embodiment, an aerosol-generating device may comprise a housing defining at least one internal compartment. The housing may be waterproof (with regard to the at least one internal compartment). The aerosol-generating device may further comprise a power supply, an electric heater, and/or a haptic feedback device. Each of the power supply, electric heater, and/or haptic feedback device may be positioned within one or more of the at least one internal compartments.</p>
<p id="p-0019" num="0018">The term &#x201c;waterproof&#x201d; is used herein to refer to a liquid ingress protection level of at least 6 when measured in accordance with IEC standard 60529. Thus, a housing that is waterproof will provide such a protection level against liquid ingress into the at least one internal compartment therein.</p>
<p id="p-0020" num="0019">Additionally, the aerosol-generating devices may comprise a haptic feedback device. In an example embodiment, the aerosol-generating device comprises a waterproof housing defining the internal compartment in which the power supply or the electric heater, or both the power supply and the electric heater, are positioned. A waterproof housing improves the reliability of aerosol-generating devices when compared to known aerosol- generating devices by protecting the power supply and the heater from water damage. Using a haptic feedback device may facilitate waterproofing of the housing since the haptic feedback device can be entirely sealed within the housing. This is in contrast to known aerosol-generating devices, which typically use at least one of a light and a speaker to provide feedback. Lights and speakers typically require at least one opening in the housing to facilitate adequate transmission of light or sound through the housing to provide the desired feedback, which prevents waterproofing of the housing.</p>
<p id="p-0021" num="0020">The aerosol-generating device may further comprise an input device positioned within the at least one internal compartment. Providing an input device may enable the control of one or more functions of the aerosol-generating device. The input device may enable the control of at least one of an activation of the electric heater, a deactivation of the electric heater, a duration of a heating cycle, an electronic locking of the device to prevent activation of the electric heater, an electronic unlocking of the device to permit activation of the electric heater, and combinations thereof. The aerosol-generating device may be configured to provide feedback via the haptic feedback device in response to an input via the input device.</p>
<p id="p-0022" num="0021">In an example embodiment, the input device is positioned within the internal compartment so that the input device does not compromise the waterproofing of the housing. The input device may comprise at least one of a capacitive sensor, an electro-optical sensor, an accelerometer, a gyroscope, a magnetometer, and combinations thereof. Such input devices facilitate the positioning of the input device within the internal compartment. This is in contrast to push-button input devices used on known aerosol-generating devices, which may prevent or compromise the waterproofing of a housing. Typically, push-button input devices extend through an aperture in a housing, which may provide a route for moisture or other contaminants to directly enter the housing.</p>
<p id="p-0023" num="0022">In example embodiments in which the input device comprises a capacitive sensor, the capacitive sensor may be positioned on an internal surface of the housing. Positioning the capacitive sensor on an internal surface may improve the sensitivity of the capacitive sensor to stimuli outside the housing. For example, positioning the capacitive sensor on an internal surface of the housing may facilitate detection of a digit or finger when positioned proximate to or against the external surface of the portion of the housing overlying the capacitive sensor. The portion of the housing overlying the capacitive sensor may have a reduced thickness compared to adjacent portions of the housing to optimize the sensitivity of the capacitive sensor. The housing may be provided with one or more indicia on the external surface of the housing to indicate the location of the capacitive sensor.</p>
<p id="p-0024" num="0023">In example embodiments in which the input device comprises an electro-optical sensor, at least a portion of the housing may be substantially transparent to at least one wavelength of electromagnetic radiation to which the electro-optical sensor is sensitive.</p>
<p id="p-0025" num="0024">In any of the example embodiments described herein, the haptic feedback device may comprise at least one of an eccentric rotating mass motor, a linear resonant actuator, and a piezoelectric device. Such haptic feedback devices may be relatively small with relatively low power requirements, and therefore particularly suitable for inclusion in aerosol-generating devices.</p>
<p id="p-0026" num="0025">The housing may be hermetically sealed. The term &#x201c;hermetically sealed&#x201d; is used herein to refer to a liquid ingress protection level of at least 7 when measured in accordance with IEC standard 60529. An aerosol-generating device comprising a hermetically sealed housing may tolerate immersion in water without suffering water damage to the power supply, the haptic feedback device, the electric heater, and any other electrical components positioned within the at least one internal compartment.</p>
<p id="p-0027" num="0026">In any of the example embodiments described herein, the electric heater may comprise at least one of a resistive heater and an inductive heater. For instance, the electric heater may be an inductive heater. An inductive heater positioned within the at least one internal compartment may be operated to heat an aerosol-generating article positioned outside of the at least one internal compartment without significant heating of the housing or other components of the aerosol-generating device.</p>
<p id="p-0028" num="0027">The aerosol-generating device may define a cavity for receiving an aerosol-generating article. At least a portion of the at least one internal compartment may circumscribe at least a portion of the cavity. The electric heater may be an inductive heater circumscribing at least a portion of the cavity. The inductive heater may have a substantially annular shape.</p>
<p id="p-0029" num="0028">In any of the example embodiments described herein, the aerosol-generating device may further comprise a wireless data connector positioned within the at least one internal compartment. A wireless data connector can facilitate data communication between the aerosol-generating device and an external device without compromising the waterproofing of the housing. The wireless data connector may be configured to transmit data from the aerosol-generating device, receive data from an external device, or transmit and receive data.</p>
