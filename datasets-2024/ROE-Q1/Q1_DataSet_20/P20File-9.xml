<p id="p-0052" num="0051">After the vaporizer is inserted in a battery rod, when the battery rod communicates with the vaporizer, the chip <b>1</b> controls the heating element L to generate heat, so that the vaporizer operates in a first mode; and when the battery rod fails to communicate with the vaporizer, the chip <b>1</b> controls the heating element L to generate heat or to not generate heat, so that the vaporizer operates in a second mode. Specifically, in a specific embodiment, if the battery rod communicates with the vaporizer, it indicates that the vaporizer can match the battery rod, and the vaporizer and the battery rod are products of a same model and produced by a same manufacturer. In this case, the vaporizer may be controlled to generate heat according to the model of the vaporizer to operate in the first mode. If the battery rod fails to communicate with the vaporizer, it indicates that the vaporizer cannot match the battery rod, and the vaporizer and the battery rod are not products of a same model and produced by a same manufacturer. In this case, a default parameter may be used for controlling the vaporizer to generate heat or prohibiting the vaporizer from generating heat to cause the vaporizer to operate in the second mode.</p>
<p id="p-0053" num="0052">Specifically, the vaporizer further includes: a first input end <i>m</i><b>1</b> and a second input end <i>m</i><b>2</b>. When the vaporizer is inserted in the battery rod, the vaporizer is electrically connected to the battery rod through the first input end <i>m</i><b>1</b> and the second input end <i>m</i><b>2</b>. In this embodiment, the heating element L and the control switch M of the chip <b>1</b> are connected in series between the first input end <i>m</i><b>1</b> and the second input end <i>m</i><b>2</b>, and the communication interface SDA of the package <b>12</b> is connected to the first input end <i>m</i><b>1</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0054" num="0053">Optionally, the vaporizer further includes: a capacitor C, where the power supply interface VDD of the package <b>12</b> is grounded through the capacitor C.</p>
<p id="p-0055" num="0054">Specifically, a first end of the heating element L is connected to the first input end <i>m</i><b>1</b>, and a second end thereof is connected to the first channel end of the control switch M. A first end of the capacitor C is connected to the power supply interface VDD, and a second end thereof is grounded.</p>
<p id="p-0056" num="0055"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b></figref> is a schematic structural diagram of a second embodiment of a vaporizer according to this application. Compared with the first embodiment of the vaporizer shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref>, a difference is that this embodiment further includes a first switch M&#x2032;, and the first switch M&#x2032; and the control switch M are connected in parallel. Specifically, a control end of the first switch M&#x2032; is connected to a switch control interface VG_SCL, a first channel end of the first switch M&#x2032; is connected to the switch channel interface VDS and the first channel end of the control switch M, and a second channel end of the first switch M&#x2032; is connected to the ground interface GND and the second channel end of the control switch.</p>
<p id="p-0057" num="0056">In this embodiment, the first switch M&#x2032; and the control switch M are connected in parallel, so that a conduction current is increased. For example, if a current that flows through the heating element L is 10 A, while the control switch M can only withstand a maximum current of 6 A, after completing an authentication operation, when the chip <b>1</b> turns on the control switch M and then uses a PWM signal to heat the heating element L, the control switch M cannot withstand the 10 A current, and an electronic vaporization device cannot vaporize normally. In this embodiment, since the expansion interface NC or the ground interface GND is reserved, the first switch M&#x2032; is externally connected, and the control switch M in the chip <b>1</b> and the first switch M&#x2032; are connected in parallel, so that the conduction current is increased. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b></figref> is a schematic structural diagram of a third embodiment of a vaporizer according to this application. Compared with the first embodiment of the vaporizer shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref>, a difference is that this embodiment further includes a second switch M&#x2033;, where the second switch M&#x2033; and the control switch M are connected in series. Specifically, a control end of the second switch M&#x2033; is connected to the switch control interface VG_SCL, a first channel end of the second switch M&#x2033; is connected to the ground interface GND and the second channel end of the control switch M, and a second channel end of the second switch M&#x2033; is connected to the second input end <i>m</i><b>2</b>. Specifically, in this embodiment, the heating element L, the control switch M, and the second switch M&#x2033; are connected in series between the first input end <i>m</i><b>1</b> and the second input end <i>m</i><b>2</b> in sequence.</p>
<p id="p-0058" num="0057">In this embodiment, when only the control switch M exists in the chip <b>1</b>, if the vaporizer is reversely inserted in the battery rod, the heating element L is grounded. When the second channel end (a source) of the control switch M is connected to the power supply voltage VDD, the power supply voltage VDD forms a channel through a body diode of the control switch M, so that reverse conduction is achieved. When only the second switch M&#x2033; exists in the chip <b>1</b>, if the vaporizer is reversely inserted in the battery rod, a body diode of the second switch M&#x2033; is in a turn-off state, which can prevent the vaporizer from being damaged due to the reverse conduction of the vaporizer. Therefore, the heating element L, the control switch M, and the second switch M&#x2033; are connected in series between the first input end <i>m</i><b>1</b> and the second input end <i>m</i><b>2</b> in sequence, which can prevent a reverse conduction problem of the control switch M.</p>
<p id="p-0059" num="0058">Operating modes of the vaporizers of the second embodiment and the third embodiment are similar to the operating mode of the vaporizer of the first embodiment. For brevity, details are not described herein again.</p>

In this embodiment, the heating element L and the control switch M are connected in parallel between the first input end <i>m</i><b>1</b> and the second input end <i>m</i><b>2</b>. Specifically, one end of the heating element L is connected to the first input end <i>m</i><b>1</b>, the switch channel interface VDS of the package <b>12</b> is connected to the first input end <i>m</i><b>1</b>, and the other end of the heating element L is connected to the ground interface GND of the package <b>12</b>. In this embodiment, the communication interface SDA of the package <b>12</b> is connected to the first input end <i>m</i><b>1</b>, and the capacitor C is connected to the power supply interface VDD of the package <b>12</b> and is grounded.

Specifically, the first channel end of the control switch M is connected to the first input end <i>m</i><b>1</b>, the second channel end of the control switch M is connected to the second input end <i>m</i><b>2</b>, and the control end of the control switch M is connected to the control end <i>n</i><b>1</b> of a driving control circuit <b>13</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0061" num="0060">In this embodiment, if the battery rod successfully communicates with the vaporizer, the battery rod may heat the heating element L according to a heating parameter stored in the vaporizer to cause the vaporizer to operate in the first mode. In this embodiment, since the heating element L and the control switch M are connected in parallel, if the battery rod fails to communicate with the vaporizer, provided that the battery rod sends a PWM signal, the heating element can still generate heat to cause the vaporizer to operate in the second mode. In this embodiment, the heating element L and the control switch M are connected in parallel, and the battery rod may determine whether the battery rod and the vaporizer are products produced by a same manufacturer by determining whether the battery rod and the vaporizer can communicate successfully, so as to identify the vaporizer, but cannot implement a function of prohibiting use of the vaporizer if the battery rod and the vaporizer do not match.</p>
<p id="p-0062" num="0061">The chip used for the vaporizer according to this application may achieve a series connection between the heating element and the control switch, or achieve a parallel connection between the heating element and the control switch, and may implement different functions according to different software settings, so as to meet different usage requirements of the vaporizer in different usage environments.</p>

<p id="p-0102" num="0101"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>14</b></figref> is a schematic structural diagram of a fifth embodiment of a vaporizer according to this application; Specifically, compared with the vaporizer shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref>, a memory <b>14</b> is further arranged in the chip <b>1</b>. Specifically, the memory <b>14</b> is arranged in a driving control circuit <b>13</b>. It should be noted that, for simplicity, the technical features shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref> are not fully shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>14</b></figref>, and for the technical features not shown, reference can be directly made to the description in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0103" num="0102">A scrap parameter is stored in the memory <b>14</b>. The scrap parameter is used for identifying whether the vaporizer can be used. Specifically, if the scrap parameter stored in memory <b>14</b> is valid, it indicates that the vaporizer cannot be used; and if the scrap parameter stored in the memory <b>14</b> is invalid, it indicates that the vaporizer can be used.</p>
<p id="p-0104" num="0103">Specifically, the communication interface SDA of the chip <b>1</b> communicates with the battery rod. Specifically, when the vaporizer is inserted in the battery rod, the vaporizer authenticates with the battery rod through the communication interface SDA. If the authentication is successful, the battery rod reads the scrap parameter stored in the memory <b>14</b> to determine whether the vaporizer can be used.</p>
<p id="p-0105" num="0104">Specifically, when the vaporizer is inserted in the battery rod, the battery rod transmits data to the communication interface SDA of the vaporizer, and if the feedback data from the vaporizer is received, the authentication is successful. In this case, the battery rod reads the scrap parameter stored in the memory <b>14</b> of the vaporizer through the communication interface SDA.</p>
<p id="p-0106" num="0105">Specifically, when the scrap parameter is in the valid state, the driving control circuit <b>13</b> controls the control switch M to be in an abnormal mode, so that the vaporizer cannot be used normally. Specifically, the driving control circuit <b>13</b> controls the control switch M to be disconnected. In this case, the battery rod cannot heat the heating element L, and the vaporizer cannot be used normally.</p>
<p id="p-0107" num="0106">When the scrap parameter is in the invalid state, the driving control circuit <b>13</b> controls the control switch M to be in the normal mode, so that the vaporizer can be used normally. Specifically, the driving control circuit <b>13</b> controls the control switch M to be turned on. In this case, the battery rod heats the heating element L, and the vaporizer can be used normally.</p>
<p id="p-0108" num="0107">Specifically, in an embodiment, the memory <b>14</b> includes a data protection area and a data read/write area, and the data read/write area stores a current inhalation parameter and the scrap parameter. The data protection area stores a default inhalation parameter and a default heating parameter. The default inhalation parameter, for example, can be the longest inhalation time or the maximum number of inhalations after oil injection of the vaporizer. The default heating parameter, for example, can be a corresponding heating power or a heating temperature curve. The current inhalation parameter, for example, can be the current inhalation time or the current number of inhalations of the vaporizer.</p>
<p id="p-0109" num="0108">The vaporizer can be used when the scrap parameter is in the invalid state. The default heating parameter is obtained by the battery rod, and the battery rod heats the heating element L according to the default heating parameter, so that the vaporizer can be used normally. Specifically, when the battery rod heats the heating element L, the driving chip can control to output a corresponding heating power so that the heating element L can reach a predetermined temperature curve, to prevent overheating of the vaporization substrate.</p>
<p id="p-0110" num="0109">In an embodiment, the driving control circuit <b>13</b> further includes a timer <b>15</b>. When the vaporizer is in used normally, the driving control circuit <b>13</b> is controlled to turn off the control switch M at a predetermined interval time. Specifically, after the driving control circuit <b>13</b> controls the control switch M to be turned on, the control switch M is regularly controlled to be turned off every timed time of the timer. Alternatively, in another embodiment, a predetermined code is written in the driving control circuit <b>13</b>, and the predetermined code can control the driving control circuit <b>13</b> to control the control switch M to be turned off every predetermined interval time.</p>
<p id="p-0111" num="0110">In an embodiment, when it is detected that the vaporizer stops inhalation, the scrap parameter and the current inhalation parameter of the vaporizer are updated. If the updated current inhalation parameter reaches the default inhalation parameter, the scrap parameter in the vaporizer is updated to the valid state.</p>
<p id="p-0112" num="0111">Specifically, a microphone or an airflow sensor is arranged in the battery rod. When the microphone or the airflow sensor detects passing of an airflow, the battery rod is awakened from a sleep state and transmits a conduction signal to the vaporizer. After the vaporizer receives a conduction instruction, the driving control circuit <b>13</b> controls the control switch M to be turned on, and then the battery rod obtains the default heating parameter to heat the heating element L, so that the vaporizer can be used normally. In this way, different vaporization substrates can be vaporized with different heating parameters to improve user experience. When the microphone or the airflow sensor detects stopping of the airflow, that is, when the inhalation is stopped, the battery rod stops heating the heating element L, and updates the current inhalation parameter in the vaporizer according to the inhalation time or the number of inhalations during the inhalation process. For example, when it is detected that the user stops sucking the electronic vaporization device, the battery rod accumulates the inhalation time or the number of inhalations and the inhalation time or the number of inhalations in the current inhalation parameter, and uses the accumulated result to update the current inhalation parameter.</p>
<p id="p-0113" num="0112">Optionally, after updating the current inhalation parameter, the updated current inhalation parameter is compared with the default inhalation time, and when the updated current inhalation parameter reaches the default inhalation parameter, it indicates that the inhalation time or the number of inhalations of the vaporizer has been used up. In this case, the scrap parameter in the vaporizer is updated to the valid state to lock the vaporizer and prevent the vaporizer from being used. When the updated current inhalation parameter does not reach the default inhalation parameter, it indicates that the inhalation time or the number of inhalations of the vaporizer has not been used up, the battery rod enters the sleep time, and when the airflow is detected next time, continues to supply power to the vaporizer to heat the heating element L.</p>
<p id="p-0114" num="0113">Further, If the scrap parameter of the vaporizer is updated to the valid state, the driving control circuit <b>13</b> controls the control switch M to be always in the off state, so as to prohibit the use of the vaporizer that the user injects oil without permission.</p>

<p id="p-0123" num="0122">Specifically, When the read scrap parameter is invalid, it indicates that the vaporizer can be used, and the battery rod obtains the default heating parameter stored in the memory <b>14</b> of the vaporizer and heats the vaporizer according to the default heating parameter. In a specific embodiment, the default inhalation parameter, for example, can be the longest inhalation time or the maximum number of inhalations after the oil injection of the vaporizer. The default heating parameter, for example, can be a corresponding heating power or a heating temperature curve.</p>
<p id="p-0124" num="0123">Specifically, the battery rod further includes: a drive circuit <b>40</b>, and the drive circuit <b>40</b> is connected to the driving chip <b>300</b> and the identification circuit <b>50</b>. When the read scrap parameter is invalid, the battery rod obtains the default heating parameter stored in the vaporizer, and uses the drive circuit <b>40</b> to heat the heating element L of the vaporizer according to the default heating parameter, so that the vaporizer can be used normally.</p>
<p id="p-0125" num="0124">In a specific embodiment, the driving chip <b>300</b> is the driving chip <b>100</b> shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>9</b></figref>, the detection communication portion D of the driving chip <b>300</b> is the first detection communication portion P<b>1</b> or the second detection communication portion P<b>1</b>&#x2032; of the driving chip <b>100</b>, the identification circuit <b>50</b> is the first identification module <b>11</b> or the second identification module <b>12</b> shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>9</b></figref>, and the drive circuit <b>40</b> is the first drive module <b>31</b> or the second drive module <b>32</b> shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>9</b></figref>. The circuit connection of the detection communication portion D, the identification circuit <b>50</b>, the drive circuit <b>40</b>, and the driving chip <b>300</b> is the same as the circuit connection of the first detection communication portion P<b>1</b>, the first identification module <b>11</b>, the first drive module <b>31</b>, and the driving chip <b>100</b> shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>9</b></figref> or the circuit connection of the second detection communication portion P<b>1</b>&#x2032;, the second identification module <b>12</b>, the second drive module <b>32</b>, and the driving chip <b>100</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0126" num="0125">It can be understood that, in other embodiments, the electronic vaporization device may also include the battery rod shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>9</b></figref>. In this case, before step S<b>11</b>, the method further includes the step: Identify whether the vaporizer is forwardly or reversely inserted and select the corresponding detection communication portion, drive module, and identification module. It can be understood that, in other embodiments, the electronic vaporization device may also include the battery rod shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>11</b></figref>, and its specific operating process is similar, which will not be repeated here.</p>
<p id="p-0127" num="0126">Step S<b>22</b>: Detect whether the vaporizer stops inhalation.</p>
<p id="p-0128" num="0127">Specifically, a microphone or an airflow sensor is arranged in the battery rod. When the microphone or the airflow sensor detects passing of an airflow, the battery rod is awakened from a sleep state and transmits a conduction signal to the vaporizer. After the vaporizer receives a conduction instruction, the driving control circuit <b>13</b> controls the control switch M to be turned on, and then the battery rod obtains the default heating parameter to heat the heating element L, so that the vaporizer can be used normally. When the microphone or the airflow sensor detects no passing of an airflow, the vaporizer stops inhalation.</p>
<p id="p-0129" num="0128">Step S<b>23</b>: Update the current number of inhalations of the vaporizer and the scrap parameter when it is detected that the vaporizer stops inhalation.</p>
<p id="p-0130" num="0129">When the microphone or the airflow sensor detects no passing of an airflow, the vaporizer stops inhalation, and the battery rod stops heating the heating element L, and updates the current inhalation parameter in the vaporizer according to the inhalation time or the number of inhalations during the inhalation process. For example, when it is detected that the user stops sucking the electronic vaporization device, the battery rod accumulates the inhalation time or the number of inhalations and the inhalation time or the number of inhalations in the current inhalation parameter, and uses the accumulated result to update the current inhalation parameter.</p>
<p id="p-0131" num="0130">Optionally, after updating the current inhalation parameter, the updated current inhalation parameter is compared with the default inhalation time, and when the updated current inhalation parameter reaches the default inhalation parameter, it indicates that the inhalation time or the number of inhalations of the vaporizer is used up. In this case, the scrap parameter in the vaporizer is updated to the valid state to lock the vaporizer and prevent the vaporizer from being used. When the updated current inhalation parameter does not reach the default inhalation parameter, it indicates that the inhalation time or the number of inhalations of the vaporizer has not been used up, the battery rod enters the sleep time, and when the airflow is detected next time, continues to supply power to the vaporizer to heat the heating element L.</p>
<p id="p-0132" num="0131">Further, If the scrap parameter of the vaporizer is updated to the valid state, the driving control circuit <b>13</b> controls the control switch M to be always in the off state, so as to prohibit the use of the vaporizer that the user injects oil without permission.</p>
<p id="p-0133" num="0132">This application provides an electronic vaporization device, where a chip is arranged in a vaporizer, and the vaporizer can communicate with a battery rod through a communication interface arranged on the chip. When the battery rod communicates with the vaporizer, the vaporizer operates in a first mode; and when the battery rod does not communicate with the vaporizer, the vaporizer operates in a second mode. Specifically, if the battery rod communicates with the vaporizer, it indicates that the battery rod and the vaporizer are products from the same manufacturer; and if the battery rod does not communicate with the vaporizer, it indicates that the battery rod and the vaporizer are not products from the same manufacturer. Through the method of this application, the battery rod and the vaporizer of the same model or different models operate in different modes, so as to meet the requirements of use in different environments.</p>
<p id="p-0134" num="0133">In the electronic vaporization device provided in this application, a driving chip and a drive identification circuit are arranged in the battery rod, and the drive identification circuit is connected to the driving chip. When the vaporizer is inserted in the battery rod, the driving chip determines that the vaporizer is inserted forwardly or reversely through the drive identification circuit and controls the drive identification circuit to operate in a forward insertion mode or a reverse insertion mode. This enables the battery rod and the vaporizer to operate normally in both the forward insertion mode and the reverse insertion mode.</p>
<p id="p-0135" num="0134">The electronic vaporization device in this application can also prevent the use of the vaporizer that the user injects oil without permission.</p>
