<p id="p-0006" num="0005">The invention refers to a photonic integrated circuit (PIC) for optically investigating flowing and/or non-flowing liquids, for example, flowing blood at a portion of tissue. The invention also refers to a method for controlling a photonic integrated circuit (PIC) for optically investigating flowing and/or non-flowing liquids.</p>

<heading id="h-0003" level="1">BACKGROUND</heading>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">Digital healthcare is transforming the healthcare industry with a rising demand for real-time and on-demand analysis of various biomarkers for a range of purposes. Wearable devices (&#x201c;wearables&#x201d;) are now commonplace in the fields of wellness and healthcare (including for e.g. fitness tracking, general health monitoring, and medical condition management). For devices such as these, there is a desire for the sensing and measuring of biological parameters to be quick, non-invasive and of sufficient specificity, sensitivity, and accuracy. As a result, there is a desire to provide components suitable for use in non-invasive wearable devices that provide the necessary technical requirements for the biological parameters that are to be measured, but also that are conveniently small and that can be manufactured at a consumer-friendly price point. Whilst, for the visible and NIR (up to 1200 nm) wavelength ranges LEDs have been used, in the IR wavebands lasers have been introduced with the benefits of narrow bandwidths and higher intensities (better S/N ratios). It is known that non-invasive sensing modules may find uses outside of the wearable device market, for example in robotics or remote sensing.</p>
<p id="p-0009" num="0008">Wearable devices should be robust, reliable and easy to wear and may include skin contact patches, wrist watches, rings, ear buds, head bands, and glasses frames.</p>
<heading id="h-0004" level="1">SUMMARY</heading>
<p id="p-0010" num="0009">This invention can be relevant to the application of lasers on spectroscopy chips for use in the visible and NIR wavelength range.</p>
<p id="p-0011" num="0010">A photonic integrated circuit (PIC) may be configured to optically investigate blood flow and blood volume changes, and/or measurements of pulse oximetry (SpO2), oxygen saturation, carboxy haemoglobin, methaemoglobin, or fractional oxygen saturation at a portion of tissue of a user. However, the photonic integrated circuit may be used for other applications, such as a Lab-on-a-Chip, for measuring other types of fluids and/or gases, for Raman spectroscopy, and/or any other type of spectroscopy measurements. Pulse oximetry (SpO2), oxygen saturation, carboxy haemoglobin, methaemoglobin, or fractional oxygen saturation are described in WO 2021/116766, filed on Dec. 11, 2020, entitled &#x201c;OPTICAL SENSING MODULE&#x201d; which is incorporated by reference in its entirety.</p>

For example, the optical components disclosed in WO 2021/116766 may include silicon nitride (Si<sub>3</sub>N<sub>4</sub>).</p>
<p id="p-0013" num="0012">One example would be the application of the photonic integrated circuit for the applications as described in International Application No. PCT/IB2022/000373 filed Jun. 24, 2022, entitled &#x201c;TRANSMITTER PHOTONIC INTEGRATED CIRCUIT&#x201d;, the entire content of which is incorporated herein by reference. The photonic integrated circuit may be the transmitter photonic integrated circuit for generating an optical signal for optical spectroscopy of a surface as described in PCT/IB2022/000373. The one or more coherent light sources described in PCT/IB2022/000373 can correspond to the lasers discussed below.</p>
<p id="p-0014" num="0013">In an optional embodiment, one, more, or all optical components, such as waveguides, light sources, and the like, disclosed in PCT/IB2022/000373 may be configured to transmit, convey, and/or are functional for light having wavelength below 1200 nm, below 1000 nm, below 850 nm, and/or 750 nm. For example, the optical components disclosed in PCT/IB2022/000373 may include silicon nitride (Si<sub>3</sub>N<sub>4</sub>).</p>
<p id="p-0015" num="0014">A further example would be the application of the photonic integrated circuit for generating an optical signal for optical spectroscopy of a surface (e.g. skin). Typically, the transmitter PIC would be used in conjunction with a receiver for receiving light that has been scattered and/or reflected from the surface being studied by spectroscopy. The photonic integrated circuit may be the transmitter photonic integrated circuit for generating an optical signal for optical spectroscopy of a surface.</p>
<p id="p-0016" num="0015">For example, the homogenizer described in PCT/IB2022/000373 may be used with the receiver. Further, the speckle mitigation techniques, such as the ones described in described in PCT/IB2022/000373, may be capable of being turned on and off and not permanently employed to address the fact that some techniques benefit from coherent light while others benefit from incoherent or spatially homogenized light.</p>

<p id="p-0084" num="0088">In an optional embodiment, the photonic integrated circuit is a silicon photonics chip. All or a majority of the optical functions necessary to generate and/or transmit optical signals and/or to receive and interpret the returning optical signals can be arranged on the silicon photonics chip.</p>
<p id="p-0085" num="0089">The transmit (Tx) and receive (Rx) parts may be on one chip to form a single transmitter/receiver chip, or on more than one chip, such as a separate Tx and Rx chip device. The silicon photonics chip may be based upon an SOI structure where there is one buried oxide layer or on a double SOI structure where there are two (or more) buried oxide layers.</p>
<p id="p-0086" num="0090">In an optional embodiment, the photonic integrated circuit further comprises at least one (optical) detector, wherein the photonic integrated circuit is configured to execute transmittance and/or reflectance photoplethysmography (PPG) and/or speckle photoplethysmography (SPG) measurements. In speckle plethysmography (SPG), an optical signal is used to measure changes in blood flow using laser speckle imaging or temporal decorrelation methods such as diffuse correlation spectroscopy. Laser speckle imaging may be provided on a receiver that is separate from the photonic integrated circuit.</p>
<p id="p-0087" num="0091">For SPG measurements, the laser may generate light in the visible or near-infrared spectrum, for example between about 380 nm to about 850 nm, or between 380 nm to about 950/960 nm. The waveguides that are used for the SPG application can be optimized for the propagation of light in visible or near infrared spectrum or having wavelengths below 960 nm, 800 nm, or 700 nm. For example, the waveguides may be made from silicon nitride (Si<sub>3</sub>N<sub>4</sub>).</p>
<p id="p-0088" num="0092">In an optional embodiment, the photonic integrated circuit is configured to execute diffuse correlation spectroscopy (DCS). DCS detects blood flow by quantifying temporal fluctuations of light fields emerging from the tissue surface. Optional embodiments are disclosed in U.S. application Ser. No. 17/814,787 and/or International Application No. PCT/EP2022/071467 which are incorporated by reference in their entirety. Optional embodiments of optical sensor modules for measuring both speckleplethysmography (SPG) and photoplethysmography (PPG) are described in U.S. application Ser. No. 17/711,974.</p>
<p id="p-0089" num="0093">In an optional embodiment, the photonic integrated circuit is configured to execute diffuse reflection spectroscopy</p>
<p id="p-0090" num="0094">In an optional embodiment, the photonic integrated circuit executes a measurement of pulse oximetry (SpO2), oxygen saturation, carboxy haemoglobin, methaemoglobin, or fractional oxygen saturation. Optional embodiments are disclosed in WO 2021/116766 which is incorporated by reference in its entirety.</p>
<p id="p-0091" num="0095">A wearable device may comprise a photonic integrated circuit as described above. The wearable device may be watch or a part of band for finger, arm, leg, and/or chest. The wearable device may provide monitoring of a pulse (heart rate), oxygen saturation, and/or parameters that are can be detected by spectroscopy of the blood in tissue.</p>
<p id="p-0092" num="0096">The photonic integrated circuit may be used to determine the pulse (heart rate) of the blood flow within the tissue and/or under the tissue. The tissue may be the skin of a user of the wearable device. To this end, the user may bring the wearable device into contact with the tissue (skin) to monitor, determine, and/or record the heart rate oxygen saturation, and/or parameters that are can be detected by spectroscopy of the blood in tissue.</p>
<p id="p-0093" num="0097">Various spectroscopy techniques, such as the ones described above, can be used to monitor the blood flow. These spectroscopy techniques rely on the light absorption characteristics of blood which changes depending on the oxygen saturation of the blood, such as the pulsatile oxygen saturation (SpO<sub>2</sub>). These techniques may be called pulse oximetry.</p>
<p id="p-0094" num="0098">To provide accurate and reliable spectroscopy measurements, such as oxygen saturation measurements, two or more lasers with wavelengths on opposite sides of an isosbestic point in the oxygen saturation curve can be used, but it can be beneficial to use various multiple wavelengths. The more wavelengths that are used for the spectroscopy measurement, the more precisely the absorption spectrum can be determined. In particular, the wavelengths generated by the n lasers can be equally distributed over parts or the complete visible spectrum and/or infrared (IR) which are commonly used to measure oxygen saturation. For example, wavelengths of 442 nm, 472 nm, 660 nm, 960 nm, and/or 1200 nm were used for determining the oxygen saturation.</p>
<p id="p-0095" num="0099">One option for including more wavelengths for investigating the blood flow is to provide an array of discrete lasers each generating a light of a fixed wavelength. The lasers can be multiplexed together. This option has the disadvantage that a multitude of lasers are needed increasing the required space of the photonic integrated circuit. Alternatively, a tunable laser can be used which has the drawback that only a small wavelength range is covered by the tunable laser.</p>
<p id="p-0096" num="0100">The invention provides a further optional solution, namely in that a plurality of (tunable) lasers is used for covering a wide range of different wavelengths. To this end, the wavelength range of the (tunable) lasers may not overlap with each other and/or may be equally distributed, for example over the visible and/or infrared spectrum. In particular, the wavelength ranges of the (tunable) lasers may cover those wavelength ranges that show a high absorption and, thus, increased signal to noise ratio (SNR). For example, the tunable lasers may have a centre frequency at 442 nm, 472 nm, 660 nm, 960 nm, and/or 1200 nm and a range of tunable frequencies &#xb1;10 nm, 20 nm, or 50 nm around the centre frequency. In particular, it is possible to evenly cover a wide wavelength range (for example, spanning over 100 nm, 200 nm, 500 nm, or 1000 nm) by selecting appropriate centre frequencies of the tunable lasers. Fluorescence measurements may be conducted using light of 442 nm or 472 nm. Further, blue light (e.g. 442 nm or 472 nm) may be used if the photonic integrated circuit is part of a vitro diagnostics, such as a lab-on-a-chip setup.</p>
<p id="p-0097" num="0101">The visible spectrum is the portion of the electromagnetic spectrum that is visible to the human eye. Electromagnetic radiation in this range of wavelengths is called visible light or simply light. A typical human eye will respond to wavelengths from about 380 nm to about 750 nm. These wavelength boundaries are not sharply defined and may vary per individual. Under optimal conditions the limits of human perception can extend to 310 nm (UV) and 1100 nm (NIR).</p>
<p id="p-0098" num="0102">Infrared (IR) light is electromagnetic radiation with wavelengths longer than those of visible light. IR is generally understood to encompass wavelengths from the nominal red edge of the visible spectrum around 700 nm to 1 mm.</p>
<p id="p-0099" num="0103">The photonic integrated circuit of this invention is configured to emit the light generated by the lasers via the output portion which may have a lens or other optical component for emitting the light from the photonic integrated circuit. The light may be guided from the photonic integrated circuit through the wearable device to leave the wearable device. To this end, the wearable device may include optical components, such as waveguides, mirrors, lenses, optical filters, and/or grating which allow the light emitted by the photonic integrated circuit to be redirected, modified and/or shaped. Alternatively, the photonic integrated circuit may include all the optical functions and/or optical components such that the output portion corresponds to the output of the light from the wearable device.</p>
<p id="p-0100" num="0104">The photonic integrated circuit and/or the silicon photonics chip can be located within a housing of the wearable device.</p>
<p id="p-0101" num="0105">The photonic integrated circuit may include a detector for detecting the light that is reflected by and/or transmitted through that issue. The receiver or detector may be arranged on the same silicon or silicon nitride photonic chip as the lasers (the transmit chip) or on a different photonic chip. The receiver or detector may be arranged within the housing of the wearable device. There may be more than one detector on the detector chip or on the transmit/receive chip. The detector is an optical instrument that transforms light impinging onto the detector in an electrical signal. The electrical signal can be indicative of the intensity and/or wavelength of the impinging light. The detector could include multiple sensing elements such as an array or a pixelated image sensor.</p>
<p id="p-0102" num="0106">Light guiding means (such as waveguides) may be provided within the wearable device for guiding the light from a light input of the wearable device do the detector. Alternatively, the detector may be located at such a position within the wearable device that light reflected and/or transmitted by the tissue and entering the variable device directly impinges on the detector without further light guiding means. However, lenses or other optical structures for focusing and/or collecting the light reflected and/or transmitted by the tissue may be provided. Further, lenses or other optical structures for focusing the light generated by the lasers onto the issue may be provided.</p>
<p id="p-0103" num="0107">The lasers, the measuring portion, the output portion, and/or the splitting/combining portion are coupled or connected to each other to allow transmission of light between these components. To this end, these components may be coupled or connected to each other via one or more optical waveguides or other types of optical components allowing the transmission of light. The optical waveguides may be part of the optical photonics chip. Thus, it is possible that light can be guided from one of these components to another one of these components. The optical waveguides may be configured to transmit radiation in the visible spectrum and/or MR (up to 1200 nm, optionally below 1000 nm). For example, the waveguides are made from silicon nitride.</p>
<p id="p-0104" num="0108">It is also possible that a free space (filled with air) is arranged between the lasers, the measuring portion, the output portion, and/or the splitting/combining portion such that light can travel through the free space from one of these components to another one of these components.</p>
<p id="p-0105" num="0109">The laser output may be that part of the (tunable) laser where the light generated by the (tunable) laser exits the (tunable) laser. For example, the laser output may be coupled or connected to a waveguide or corresponds to a section/end of a waveguide of the (tunable) laser. The (tunable) laser may be configured to generate light of discrete wavelengths or to cover a continuous wavelength range. The light emitted by the (tunable) laser has a certain wavelength and/or an intensity which can be set using a control portion controlling the (tunable) laser. There are n laser outputs as each laser includes a laser output.</p>
<p id="p-0106" num="0110">The measuring portion is configured to measure the intensity and/or the wavelength of light received or input at the measuring port. The measuring port may be considered an input port of the measuring portion, i.e. a part of the measuring portion configured to receive light. For example, the measuring port is connected to a waveguide.</p>
<p id="p-0107" num="0111">Optionally, the measuring portion includes a wavemeter for determining the wavelength of the light input at the measuring port and/or a photodetector for measuring the intensity of the light input at the measuring port. A wavemeter (or wavelength meter) can be a kind of interferometer which is used for precise wavelength measurements for light. There are different variants, including scanning wavemeters and static devices with no moving parts.</p>
<p id="p-0108" num="0112">The wavemeter transforms the light impinging onto the wavemeter into an electrical signal. The electrical signal can be indicative of the wavelength of the impinging light.</p>
<p id="p-0109" num="0113">The photodetector is an optical instrument that transforms light impinging onto the photodetector into an electrical signal. The electrical signal can be indicative of the intensity of the impinging light.</p>
<p id="p-0110" num="0114">In case the measuring port includes both the wavemeter and the photodetector, the measuring port includes an optical splitter which is connected to the measuring port and splits the incoming light to the wavemeter and the photodetector. The measuring portion may include one or more optical waveguides for guiding the light from the measuring port to the splitter and/or from the splitter to the wavemeter and the photodetector.</p>
<p id="p-0111" num="0115">The output portion may include one or more optical waveguides and/or one or more lens structures which allow the emission of the light generated by the (tunable) lasers from the photonic integrated circuit.

The waveguides of the output potion may end at an edge of the photonic integrated circuit and can include the lens structure at their end. For example, each waveguide has a separate lens structure or there is a common lens structure coupled to the waveguides.

<p id="p-0149" num="0151">The method may be executed by the control portion. Thus, the method may be a (computer-implemented) method for controlling the photonic integrated circuit described above.</p>
<p id="p-0150" num="0152">Step a) refers to setting or tuning the wavelength of the light generated by one or more/all of the tunable lasers. To this end, the control portion may output an electrical signal having a certain tuning parameter or change the tuning parameter of the electrical signal.</p>
<p id="p-0151" num="0153">Step a) may be executed before step b). This means that the tuning element is set or tuned before light is generated by the photodiode/RSOA. However, step b) can be executed before step a).</p>
<p id="p-0152" num="0154">Step b) may also include setting the intensity of the light generated by one or more/all of the (tunable) lasers. This is also done by starting the output of the electrical signal or by changing a tuning parameter of the electrical signal to the (tunable) laser (in particular the photodiode). The intensity and/or the wavelength generated by the photodiode/RSOA may be different to the intensity and/or the wavelength by the (tunable) laser since the tuning element changes the wavelength and potentially the intensity.</p>
<p id="p-0153" num="0155">Step c) refers to measuring the intensity and/or the wavelength that is emitted by the (tunable) laser, i.e. the light that is modified by the tuning element. Step c) may be executed by the measuring portion.</p>
<p id="p-0154" num="0156">Step d) may be executed by the detector and can be executed simultaneously to step c). Thus, feedback control of the generated laser light and detection of the light reflected and/or transmitted by the tissue can be simultaneously done. Step c) includes processing the detected light in order to determine the blood flow. This may be done by the control portion or by a processor external to silicon photonics chip. This processing is known in the field and, thus, not further described here.</p>
<p id="p-0155" num="0157">Step e) refers to the repetition of steps a) to d) such that each wavelength that is generated by the different photodiodes/RSOAs and each tuned wavelength is used for determining the blood flow. This can be done by scanning firstly to all the wavelengths that can be tuned by the respective tuning element of a tunable laser and then repeating this process for each tunable laser. Alternatively, a particular tunable laser with a particular tuning setting is measured and, in the next step, another tuneable laser is turned on with a particular tuning setting. This step is repeated until all tunable lasers have been turn on and off. Then, the tuning parameter is changed, and the above cycle is repeated for each of the different tuning parameters. Thus, step e) includes varying the tunable lasers and varying the tuning of each of the tunable lasers. After completion of the method, a wide range of different wavelengths has been used for determining the blood flow, volume, or other chromophore increasing the reliability and accuracy of the measurement of the blood flow, volume, or other chromophore. Optionally, all wavelengths that can be generated by the n tunable lasers are used in the method.</p>
<p id="p-0156" num="0158">In an optional embodiment, step a) is executed based on pre-calibrated set points and, optionally, before step b).</p>
<p id="p-0157" num="0159">This embodiment may include setting the tuning parameters independent of the measurements result received in step c), i.e. no feedback control of the (tunable) laser is used.

<p id="p-0158" num="0160">The execution of step a) before step b) may allow the tuning elements to settle resulting in a more reliable tuning of the wavelength.</p>
<p id="p-0159" num="0161">In an optional embodiment, step e) is repeated for each one of the n tunable lasers and each wavelength that can be generated by the n tunable lasers.

Afterwards, the generation of light of this tunable laser is stopped and different tuneable laser is turned on. If all n tunable lasers were turned on and off again for the respective blood flow measurement, a new tuning parameter for the tuning elements is output and the above-described cycle is repeated.</p>
<p id="p-0162" num="0164">In an optional embodiment, step b) is executed before a), wherein optionally the setting of the tuning element of the one of the n tunable lasers is based on the results achieved in step c).</p>

<p id="p-0167" num="0169">An optical coupler may comprise a first optical element including a first waveguide and a second optical element including a second waveguide and an end portion. The first waveguide includes a facet configured to emit electromagnetic radiation from the first optical element. The end portion is configured to couple electromagnetic radiation into the second optical element. The first optical element and a second optical element are fixed so that the facet faces the end portion. The end portion includes a plurality of nanobeams wherein each nanobeam has a width that is smaller than the width of the second waveguide. The end portion includes a merging section at which the nanobeams merge. The optical element further includes a tapered portion arranged between the merging section and the second waveguide. A minimal width of the merging section is smaller than the width of the second waveguide.</p>
<p id="p-0168" num="0170">The nanobeams may have a dimension (e.g. width and/or height) between 300 nm and 50 nm, optionally 200 nm or less, 150 nm or less, 100 nm or less. The nanobeam may be considered a nano-waveguide.</p>
<p id="p-0169" num="0171">Waveguides are basic elements of optical systems that can carry light between different sections of a photonic chip. However, photonic chips are usually not uniform on a single aperture substrate, mainly due to the fabrication incompatibility between active and passive materials. Therefore, transferring light from one part of the photonic chip to another part of the photonic chip in an efficient way is required. So far, various methods have been studied for coupling light from a fiber optic structure to an integrated optical waveguide using grating, inverse taper design, end couplers, and lateral couplers. In all these proposals, the main objective is to design an intermediate transition part between two different waveguides that can smoothly transfer light by matching the mode sizes and effective refractive index values.</p>
<p id="p-0170" num="0172">While some techniques can achieve high coupling efficiencies, but mainly they rely on bulky components such as micro positioners to precisely control the angle and distance of two waveguide structures. Therefore, they are barely compatible for real applications and packaging in nano scales unless with poor coupling efficiencies. For example, coupling from an RSOA chip to a passive integrated waveguide (e.g., silicon-based) is crucial because active materials are not compatible with complementary metal-oxide-semiconductors (CMOS). Therefore, the output light from an RSOA needs to be coupled to a PIC externally.</p>
<p id="p-0171" num="0173">There are two common approaches to couple light from an active device into a PIC: (1) lateral coupling from top side of chip and using evanescent waves, (2) end coupling from the edge of chip. Both methods may use bonding for practical applications. The focus of this embodiment is on the second approach.</p>
<p id="p-0172" num="0174">The optical coupler may be used with the photonic integrated circuit (PIC) described above. For example, the first optical element can be the RSOA and the second optical element may be the tunable filter. In other words, the optical coupler can be used with the tunable laser described above.</p>
<p id="p-0173" num="0175">The first optical element may be manufactured on a first substrate while the second optical element may be manufactured on a second substrate so that the first optical element and the second optical element may need to be assembled for providing the optical coupler (e.g. the tunable laser). For example, the first optical element is fixed to the second act optical element by using an adhesive such as a glue. However, any means for fixing the first optical element with respect to the second optical element are possible as long as there is a fixed relationship between the first optical element and the second optical element.</p>
<p id="p-0174" num="0176">The first waveguide and/or the second waveguide may be waveguides as described above, i.e. optical structures for conveying electromagnetic radiation. For example, the first optical element includes a light source which generates electromagnetic radiation such as monochromatic light. The electromagnetic radiation generated by the light source (e.g. a RSOA as described above) is conveyed by the first waveguide to the facet.</p>
<p id="p-0175" num="0177">The facet may be an end surface of the first optical waveguide from which the electromechanical radiation conveyed in the first waveguide is emitted from the first optical element. The facet may be close to or flush with a side surface of the first substrate of the first optical element. This means that the facet is arranged close to or at an edge of the first substrate.</p>
<p id="p-0176" num="0178">Similarly, the end portion may include several end surfaces for each nanobeam so that light can be coupled into the respective nanobeams via these end surfaces. In other words, the end portions may include facets, i.e. each nanobeam includes a facet which faces the facet of the first waveguide. The end surfaces or facets of the nanobeams may be arranged in a single plane which might be close to or flush with a side surface of the first substrate of the first optical element. This means that the facets or end surfaces of the nanobeams are arranged close to or at an edge of the second substrate.</p>
<p id="p-0177" num="0179">The nanobeams and the merging section may form a fork shape. The nanobeams are the prongs of the fork while the merging section is the portion of the fork to which each nanobeam is connected. So the nanobeams are in optical communication with the merging section which is in optical communication with the tapered portion. The nanobeams may have a width which is smaller than the width of the second waveguide for example less than 10%, 15%, 20%, or 25% of the width of the second waveguide. The maximal distance between the respective nanobeams may be more than the width of the nanobeams.</p>
<p id="p-0178" num="0180">Optionally, there is an odd number of nanobeams. For example, there is a center nanobeam which is in the middle of a pair of nanobeams. One, two, or more pairs of nanobeams may be provided whereby the first nanobeam is arranged between the second pair of nanobeams, etc. Each pair of nanobeams may form a Y-coupler at the merging section.</p>
<p id="p-0179" num="0181">The tapered portion is in optical communication with the merging section and the second waveguide so that there is an optical pathway from each facet of the respective nanobeam to the merging section via the tapered portion to the second waveguide. The end portion (e.g. all nanobeams), the tapered portion, the merging section and/or the second waveguide may be a unitary component. The second waveguide may be in optical communication with other optical components (e.g. the above-described measuring portion and/or the above-described port) arranged on the second optical element.</p>
<p id="p-0180" num="0182">The tapered portion may have a minimal width which less than the width of the second waveguide, for example less than 10%, 15%, 20%, 25%, 30%, 40%, or 50%. Optionally, the tapered portion has the same width as the width of the nanobeams. The second waveguide may be configured for multimode propagation of light. This means that a width and a height of the second waveguide are chosen such that multiple modes of electromagnetic radiation can propagate within the second waveguide. In contrast thereto, the tapered portion may have a width and height which are chosen should such that only a single mode of electromagnetic radiation can propagate within the tapered portion. The tapered portion may act as a multimode filter allowing only the propagation of a single mode.</p>
<p id="p-0181" num="0183">The facets of the nanobeams facing the facet of the first waveguide may be spaced apart along the side surface of the second optical element which can be positioned opposite to the facet of the first waveguide. The fixation of the first optical element to the second optical element may not be done with such accuracy that an offset of the first waveguide with regard to the second waveguide can be avoided. The provision of the plurality of nanobeams is immune to a slight offset of the first waveguide with respect to the second waveguide (or the plurality of nanobeams). A width of the assembly of the plurality of nanobeams can be chosen such that it is larger than an accuracy of the fixation of the first waveguide with respect to the second waveguide. This means that, if the first optical component is fixed to the second optical component within the accuracy range, the electromagnetic radiation emitted by the first waveguide is reliably coupled into one or more of the nanobeams. In particular, the electromagnetic radiation emitted by the first waveguide propagates simultaneously in or more of the nanobeams. The intensity of the electromagnetic radiation in the respective nanobeam depends on its proximity to the facet of the first waveguide, i.e. on the unique fixation of the first optical component with respect to the second optical component. Since the width of the assembly of the plurality of nanobeams is chosen greater than the accuracy of the fixation of the first optical element to the second optical element, light can be reliable coupled into the second optical component since one or more of the nanobeams is sufficiently close to the facet of the first waveguide. For example, a coupling tolerance of 0.5 dB drop in maximum efficiency against lateral misalignment is &#xb1;0.5 &#x3bc;m.</p>
<p id="p-0182" num="0184">The optical coupler is not only less susceptible to manufacturing inaccuracies but also exhibits a coupling loss which can be as low as &#x2212;1 dB. Further, a wavelength bandwidth of 0.5 dB drop in maximum efficiency can be about 300 nm with a center wavelength of 950 nm.</p>

<p id="p-0186" num="0188">This means that the facet is inclined (i.e. not perpendicular) to the direction of extension of the first waveguide close to the facet. This improves the out-coupling characteristics of the first waveguide. For example, less light is reflected back into the first waveguide at the facet. The facet may be flush with a side surface of the substrate of the first optical element. This means that the side surface of the first optical element is inclined (i.e. not perpendicular) to the direction of extension of the first waveguide close to the facet, for example by 80&#xb0; and 84&#xb0;, optionally 82&#xb0;. The back-reflection at the facet can be less than 0.1%.</p>

However, it is also possible that the side surface of the second optical component and the straight sections of the nanobeams and/or the second waveguide to define an angle less than 90&#xb0; (the second angle). The second angle is provided to accommodate a further diffraction of the light by the adhesive between the first optical element and the second optical element. For example, the adhesive diffracts the electromagnetic radiation by 9&#xb0;. This is addressed by selecting an second angle of 81&#xb0; between the straight sections of the nanobeams and the side surface of the substrate of the second optical element.</p>

<p id="p-0191" num="0193">In an optional embodiment, the first waveguide includes a T-bar providing facet.</p>
<p id="p-0192" num="0194">The T-bar may be constituted by an end section of the first waveguide. The end section can be formed so that the end section and the facet provided thereon have a width greater than a width of the first waveguide leading to the end section. Optionally, the end section and/or the facet have a width of least W+2R, wherein W is the width of the first waveguide leading to the end section and R is the radius of curvature of corners of the end section caused as a result of the manufacturing process used to fabricate the end section or T-bar. This may ensure that an area of the facet at which the electromagnetic radiation exits the first waveguide is planar, i.e., free from curvatures or round corners that may result in back reflection of the electromagnetic radiation at the facet. Thus, the T-bar can help to prevent back reflection at the facet. The T-bar may have a height that is equal to the height of the first waveguide. Optionally, a side surface of the T-bar corresponds to the facet of the waveguide.</p>
