<?summary-of-invention description="Summary of Invention" end="lead"?>
<heading id="h-0001" level="1">FIELD OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0003" num="0001">The present invention relates generally to assessment of the coronary circulation of the heart of a human patient, and relates more specifically to methods and systems for determining the microvascular resistance reserve and the microvascular resistance of the coronary microcirculation in the heart.</p>
<heading id="h-0002" level="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0004" num="0002">The coronary circulation, i.e. the blood supply of the heart, consists of the so-called epicardial coronary arteries, which have a diameter in the interval of about 0.5 to 5 millimeter and are visible on a coronary angiogram, and the so-called coronary microcirculation or microvasculature, which consists of arterioles and capillaries having a diameter less than 0.5 millimeter and are not visible on a coronary angiogram.</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0003">Disease of the epicardial coronary arteries, e.g. narrowings or occlusions, which can lead to angina pectoris or heart attacks, can be well diagnosed and treated by multiple techniques. In all patients diagnosed with a coronary artery disease, 25-50% of the patients suffer, however, from symptoms which are not caused solely by epicardial narrowings but also by microvascular disease. Reliable systems and techniques for assessing such a complex disease are unfortunately not yet available. Instead present methods are crude, inaccurate, operator-dependent, and are not quantitative or do not discriminate between the contributions of the epicardial arteries and the microvasculature to the disease. Without the possibility to distinguish between epicardial contribution and microvascular contribution to a disease, optimum diagnosis and treatment of patients having a heart disease is apparently hampered.</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0004">In an article by Xaplanteris et al. (<i>Circ Cardiovasc Interv. </i>2018; 11:e006194. DOI: 10.1161/CIRCINTERVENTIONS. 117.006194), it is shown how the absolute microvascular resistance at maximum hyperemia can be derived from measurements of blood pressure and maximum blood flow. Knowledge of the absolute microvascular resistance solves some of the problems mentioned above, but so far absolute microvascular resistance can only be assessed during maximum vasodilation of the microvasculature, and its use is further limited by the lack of uniform normal values due to large variation depending on the amount of myocardial tissue being perfused and a large variation within normal, i.e. healthy, individuals.</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0005">The object of the present invention is therefore to provide an improved method and a system for assessment of microvascular coronary disease, which, in turn, will facilitate and improve the diagnosis and treatment of the microvascular coronary disease in question. Another object of the invention is to provide an improved method and a system for assessment of microvascular coronary disease in presence of also epicardial coronary disease.</p>
<heading id="h-0003" level="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0008" num="0006">The above-mentioned objects are achieved by the present invention according to the independent claims. Preferred embodiments are set forth in the dependent claims.</p>
<p id="p-0009" num="0007">The method and system according to the invention include calculation of microvascular resistance under resting conditions in such a manner that it is not confounded by the presence of epicardial disease, and provide a new index, called microvascular resistance reserve (MRR), which unequivocally measures the microvascular function or the severity of microvascular disease, not confounded by the presence of epicardial disease. To obtain MRR, measurements under both resting and hyperemic conditions are performed.</p>
<p id="p-0010" num="0008">Herein, the terms &#x201c;proximal&#x201d; and &#x201c;distal&#x201d; as well as similar or related terms such as &#x201c;proximally&#x201d;, &#x201c;distally&#x201d;, &#x201c;proximal position&#x201d;, &#x201c;proximal pressure&#x201d;, &#x201c;distal position&#x201d; and &#x201c;distal pressure&#x201d; are used. These are well-known and generally accepted definitions within the field of cardiology and also in the cardiovascular scientific literature. In case of a coronary stenosis, whether focal or diffuse and revealed or detected by, e.g., coronary angiography or FFR measurement, the term &#x201c;proximal&#x201d; refers to a position proximal to that stenosis and the term &#x201c;distal&#x201d; refers to a position distal to that stenosis. In case of a normal or near-normal coronary artery, the term &#x201c;proximal&#x201d; refers to a position in the first part of that artery, i.e. close to its ostium, and the term &#x201c;distal&#x201d; refers to a position in the distal part of the coronary artery. In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>, a stenotic artery is schematically depicted to illustrate the description of the invention, but also without a stenosis, i.e. in the case of a normal coronary artery, the description and scope of the present invention remain valid with &#x201c;proximal&#x201d; and &#x201c;distal&#x201d; pressures as defined above. Thus, wherever, the expression &#x201c;position proximal of any stenosis&#x201d; is used, one should read &#x201c;proximal in the coronary artery&#x201d; in the case that there is no epicardial stenosis present, i.e. in case of a normal coronary artery; and wherever the expression &#x201c;position distal of any stenosis&#x201d; is used, one should read &#x201c;distal in the coronary artery&#x201d; in the case that there is no epicardial stenosis present, i.e. in case of a normal coronary artery, where &#x201c;any&#x201d; also can be &#x201c;a&#x201d; or &#x201c;the&#x201d; or similar determinations.</p>
<p id="p-0011" num="0009">Pressure measured at a position proximal in the coronary artery or proximally of any stenosis, if present, is indicated by P<sub>a</sub>. If P<sub>a </sub>is measured under resting conditions, it is called P<sub>a,rest </sub>and if it is measured under hyperaemic conditions, it is called P<sub>a,hyper</sub>.</p>

<p id="p-0015" num="0012">It should be realized that the actual resting microvascular resistance measured for any myocardial territory is influenced by the presence of epicardial disease. The latter, whether focal or diffuse, will lead to compensatory microvascular vasodilation by autoregulation. Thus, measured microvascular resistance is not the true R<sub>micro,rest </sub>but a lower value due to the autoregulatory compensation. Accordingly, it is noteworthy to emphasize that R<sub>micro,rest </sub>as used here does not represent the actually present resting microvascular resistance but the value of resting microvascular resistance in the (hypothetical) case that the epicardial conduit is completely normal. Q<sub>rest </sub>is the blood flow through the coronary artery during rest and Q<sub>max </sub>is the blood through the coronary artery during hypermia.</p>
<p id="p-0016" num="0013">All six aspects of the invention described below are based on the common inventive concept that they are based on a microvascular resistance during rest, R<sub>micro,rest</sub>, which is not confounded by epicardial disease. R<sub>micro,rest </sub>may also be called true microvascular resistance at rest because it is not dependent on epicardial disease, if present.</p>
<p id="p-0017" num="0014">In a first aspect, the invention relates to a method for determining the microvascular resistance reserve, MRR, in the myocardium perfused by a normal or a stenotic coronary artery of a human patient, which method comprises the step of during rest condition of the patient:

<p id="p-0098" num="0087">The pressure measurements required by the present method are all well known to the skilled person and are in particular practiced during measurement of the fractional flow reserve (FFR), which is a standard technique in medical examinations of the coronary artery. During FFR measurements the presence and the position of a stenosis, if any, are determined. Typically, the measurement distally of a stenosis (or distal in the coronary artery if no stenosis is present) is performed with a sensor-tipped guidewire. Such sensors are readily available, e.g. the PressureWire&#x2122; X Guidewire sold by the company Abbott. The pressure proximally can be measured with a so-called pressure catheter or guiding catheter. It is, however, possible to also measure the proximal pressure with a sensor-tipped guidewire. Here it should be noted that from experience it is known that aortic pressure is generally independent of the state of the patient (i.e. whether the patient is in a state of hyperemia or in rest) if blood flow, both at rest and at hyperemia, is measured by thermodilution flow measurements and saline is continuously infused at different infusion rates. Thus, according to the present invention, the proximal pressure can be measured then during rest condition of the patient or during hyperemic state of the patient. Thus, equation (3) derived above can be generalized as:</p>

<p id="p-0100" num="0088">In case that P<sub>a </sub>does change between the state of rest and the state of hyperemia (as can be the case with other means to induce hyperemia such as&#x2014;but not limited to&#x2014;adenosine injection or infusion), it is important that the pressure measured proximally of the stenosis should be taken as P<sub>a </sub>at rest (also called P<sub>a,rest</sub>) and P<sub>d </sub>as P<sub>d </sub>during hyperemia (also called P<sub>d,hyper</sub>), see equation (3).The skilled person is further very familiar with methods for inducing a hyperemic state in a patient.</p>
<p id="p-0101" num="0089">The flow measurements and the corresponding flow measurement system(s) for performing such flow measurements can, for example, by done with a system for measuring blood flow according to the continuous thermodilution technique. This is a technique well known to the skilled person, and is, for example, described in the U.S. Pat. No. 7,775,988 to Pijls. A catheter for such flow measurements is also readily available, for example the RayFlow&#x2122; multipurpose infusion catheter sold by the company HexaCath.</p>
<p id="p-0102" num="0090">However, the skilled person knows many other techniques for invasive or non-invasive blood flow measurements. Such invasive techniques encompass bolus thermodilution, timed venous collection, electromagnetic flow measurement, conductance measurements, Doppler ultrasound, or calibrated Doppler probes, thermo-convection, thermo-conduction, and epicardial ultrasonic flow velocity measurement. Most of these techniques are, for example, described in &#x201c;Maximal Myocardial Perfusion as a Measure of the Functional Significance of Coronary Artery Disease&#x201d;, by N. H. J. Pijls (1991), Cip-Gegevens Koninklijke Bibliotheek, den Haag, (ISBN 90-9003818-3). Examples of non-invasive flow measurement are techniques using Computed Tomography, Magnetic Resonance Imaging, Positron Emission Tomography, or echocardiography</p>
<p id="p-0103" num="0091">Typically, the system for blood flow measurement during rest condition of the patient is the same as the system for blood flow measurement during a hyperemic state of the patient. It is, however, within the scope of the invention, that a first blood flow measuring system, which is used for blood flow measurement during rest condition, is different from a second blood flow measuring system, which is used for blood flow measurements during hyperemic condition. It is also within the scope of the invention that Q<sub>max </sub>and Q<sub>rest </sub>and P<sub>a </sub>and P<sub>d </sub>can be measured at different times.</p>
