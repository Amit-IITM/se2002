<p id="p-0001" num="0000">A lace tensioning device includes a housing component having an interior region, a first aperture, and a second aperture, and a spool component that is rotatably positionable within the interior region of the housing component. The spool component has a central cylindrical member and a lumen that extends through the central cylindrical portion. The spool component is rotatable within the interior region of the housing component to align one end of the lumen with the first aperture and to align an opposite end of the lumen with the second aperture to enable a lace to be inserted through the first aperture, the lumen, and the second aperture so that opposing ends of the lace are positioned exterior to the housing component. A knot may then be tied in the lace and the lace retracted to couple the lace with the housing component and spool component.</p>

<heading id="h-0002" level="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">The present invention is related to closure devices for various articles, such as braces, medical devices, shoes, clothing, apparel, and the like. Such articles typically include closure devices that allow the article to be placed and closed about a body part. The closure devices are typically used to maintain or secure the article to the body part. For example, shoes are typically placed over an individual's foot and lace is tensioned and tied to close the shoe about the foot and secure the shoe to the foot. Conventional closure devices have been modified in an effort to increase the fit and/or comfort of the article about the body part. For example, shoe lacing configurations and/or patterns have been modified in an attempt to increase the fit and/or comfort of wearing shoes. Conventional closure devices have also been modified in an effort to decrease the time in which an article may be closed and secured about the body part. These modifications have resulted in the use of various pull cords, straps, and tensioning devices that enable the article to be quickly closed and secured to the foot.</p>
<heading id="h-0003" level="1">BRIEF SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">The embodiments described herein provide closure systems having a reduced overall part and/or component count. The closure systems may be used to close and/or tighten a variety of articles, such as shoes, braces, apparel, sporting equipment, and the like. The reduced part or component count reduces the overall cost of the system and/or enable simple assembly of the system. According to one aspect, a reel assembly for tightening an article is provided. The reel assembly includes a housing component that includes an interior region. A spool component is rotatably positioned within the interior region of the housing component. The spool includes an annular channel around which a tension member is gathered to tighten the article. A drive component is positioned axially above the spool component and operably coupled therewith. The drive component allows the spool component to rotate in a first direction within the housing component's interior region while preventing rotation of the spool component in a second direction.</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">A tightening component is rotatably coupled within the housing and positioned axially above the drive component and coupled therewith. Operation of the tightening component causes the spool component to rotate within the housing component's interior region in the first direction to gather the tension member around the spool component's annular channel and thereby tighten the article. An attachment component is positioned axially below the spool component. The attachment component includes a coupling member that protrudes axially upward into the interior region of the housing component to couple the attachment component with the drive component. The reel assembly includes no more than six separate components. In some embodiments, the reel assembly includes no more than five separate components. One or more of the reel assembly's components may assemble by snapping together so that the reel assembly is free of a screw, rivet, or other rigid fastener.</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">In some embodiments, the tightening component includes a main body and a grip body that is positioned on a circumferential edge of the main body. The grip body has a coefficient of friction that is greater than the main body to enable a user to easily grip and operate the tightening component. In some embodiments, the tightening component is axially moveable relative to the housing component to disengage the drive component and spool component and thereby allow the spool component to rotate in the second direction and thereby loosen the article. In some embodiments, the reel assembly may also include a mounting component that is couplable with the article and releasably couplable with the reel assembly. The mounting component may include a mounting feature that is configured for releasably coupling with the reel assembly and an attachment feature that is configured for coupling with the article. The mounting feature may be made of a first material and the attachment feature may be made of a second material that is softer than the first material.</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">In some embodiments, the drive component includes teeth that engage with corresponding teeth of the housing component or a clutch component (e.g., a separate disc or component) to allow the spool component to rotate in the first direction while preventing rotation in the second direction. The drive component includes one or more tabs that are positioned over a top surface of the drive component. The one or more tabs are configured to move the drive component's teeth axially upward as the drive component is moved axially upward to disengage the drive component's teeth from the corresponding teeth of the housing component or clutch component. The clutch component may be a component that mates with the spool component, housing component, or tightening component and includes teeth that axially or radially engage with the drive component's teeth. The drive component may be moved axially upward via a user pulling axially upward on the tightening component (e.g., knob), by a user operating the tightening component (e.g., rotating a knob counterclockwise), by a user pressing or selecting a button, and the like.</p>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">According to another embodiment, a reel assembly for tightening an article is provided. The reel assembly includes a housing having: an interior region, an open top end, and an open bottom end. A spool is rotatably positioned within the interior region of the housing. The spool is configured for gathering a tension member there around to tighten the article. A drive component is positioned axially above the spool and operably coupled therewith to allow the spool to rotate in a first direction within the housing's interior region while preventing rotation of the spool in a second direction. A tightening component is positioned axially above the drive component and coupled therewith such that operation of the tightening component causes the spool to rotate within the housing's interior region in the first direction to gather the tension member around the spool and thereby tighten the article. When the reel assembly is assembled, the spool is substantially positioned within the interior region and is accessible from the open bottom end of the housing to allow a user to couple the tension member with the spool.</p>
<p id="p-0009" num="0008">In some embodiments, the reel assembly also includes an attachment component that is positioned axially below the spool. The attachment component includes a coupling member that protrudes axially upward into the housing's interior region and couples with the drive component. In some embodiments, the housing may also include a partition that is configured to contact a top surface of the spool to prevent the spool from being moved axially upward within the housing.</p>
<p id="p-0010" num="0009">In some embodiments, the drive component may be axially moveable to disengage from the spool component and thereby allow the spool component to rotate in the second direction. The drive component may be axially moveable via a rotation of the tightening component in the second direction, or may be axially moveable via axial movement of the tightening component relative to the housing. In some embodiments, the tension member may be integrally formed from the housing by elongating and deforming a material of the housing.</p>
<p id="p-0011" num="0010">According to another embodiment, a method of assembling a reel assembly is provided. The method includes coupling a drive component with a tightening component and coupling the tightening component with a top end of a housing so that the drive component faces an interior region of the housing. The method also includes inserting a spool component within a bottom end of the housing so that the spool component is positioned within the interior region of the housing and so that a top end of the spool component faces a bottom surface of the drive component. The method further includes coupling an attachment component with the bottom end of the housing. The attachment component includes a coupling member that couples with the drive component. Coupling of the coupling member with the drive component operationally couples the drive component and the spool component so that operation of the tightening component causes the spool component to rotate within the housing in a first direction while preventing rotation of the spool component in a second direction.</p>
<p id="p-0012" num="0011">In some embodiments, assembling the reel assembly includes coupling the components such that the reel assembly is free of a screw or other rigid fastener. In some embodiments, coupling the drive component with the tightening component includes snapping the drive component into a recessed portion of the tightening component. In some embodiments, coupling the tightening component with the top end of the housing includes snapping a lip of the tightening component over a corresponding lip of the housing. In some embodiments, coupling the attachment component with the bottom end of the housing includes snapping a flange of the attachment component within an aperture of the housing. In some embodiments, the method further includes snapping the attachment component's coupling member within an aperture of the drive component to couple said components together. In some embodiments, the assembled reel assembly may be coupled with a mounting component that is positioned on an article to be tightened with the reel assembly.</p>
<p id="p-0013" num="0012">According to another embodiment, a reel assembly for tightening an article is provided. The reel assembly includes a housing having an interior region and a partition that divides the interior region into an upper portion and a lower portion. A spool is rotatably positioned within the lower portion of the housing's interior region axially below the partition. The partition prevents the spool from axially moving upward into the upper portion. A drive component is positioned within the upper portion of the housing's interior region. The drive component is axially moveable relative to the spool between an engaged state and a disengaged state. In the engaged state, the drive component allows the spool to rotate in a first direction within the housing's interior region while preventing rotation of the spool component in a second direction. In the disengaged state, the drive component allows the spool to rotate in the second direction within the housing's interior region.</p>
<p id="p-0014" num="0013">A tightening component is positioned axially above the drive component and coupled therewith so that operation of the tightening component causes the spool to rotate within the housing's interior region in the first direction. An attachment component is positioned axially below the spool. The attachment component includes a coupling member that protrudes axially upward into the interior region of the housing and couples with the drive component.</p>
<p id="p-0015" num="0014">According to another embodiment, an integrated tightening device and lacing system is provided. The integrated device and system includes a base portion and a tension member that has a proximal end integrally formed with the base portion and a distal end opposite the proximal end. The tension member is formed by elongating and deforming a material of the base portion. The integrated device and system also includes a spool that is coupled with the distal end of the tension member. The spool is configured for gathering the tension member to tighten an article. The integrated device and system further includes a tightening component that is operationally coupled with the spool so that operation of the tightening component causes the spool to gather the tension member and thereby tighten the article.</p>
<p id="p-0016" num="0015">In some embodiments, the distal end of the tension member includes a grip feature that facilitates in elongating the material of the base portion. In some embodiments, the material of the base portion is deformable only while the material is above a threshold temperature.</p>
<p id="p-0017" num="0016">According to another embodiment, a method of forming a lacing system is provided. The method includes securing a material of a base portion and elongating the material of the base portion to form a tension member having a proximal end that is integrally attached to the base portion and a distal end opposite the proximal end. The method also includes coupling the distal end of the tension member with a spool. The spool is configured for gathering the tension member to tighten an article. The method further includes operationally coupling the spool with a tightening component so that operation of the tightening component causes the spool to gather the tension member and thereby tighten the article.</p>
<p id="p-0018" num="0017">In some embodiments, securing the material of the base portion includes gripping a grip feature of the base portion. The grip feature facilitates elongation of the base portion's material. In some embodiments, the method additionally includes elongating the material of the base portion while the material is above a threshold temperature.</p>

<heading id="h-0005" level="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0041" num="0040">Embodiments of the invention provide closure devices (hereinafter reel assemblies) with a reduced component count compared with conventional closure devices. The component count reduction may be provided by integrating one or more of the reel assembly components into a single component. The integrated components may perform multiple operations, such as functioning as a lace winding spool while simultaneously functioning as a ratchet winding mechanism. The reduced component count of the reel assembly simplifies the overall system, thereby reducing the cost and/or complexity of the system. The reduced component count may also reduce the risk of component or system breakage and/or malfunction.</p>
<p id="p-0042" num="0041">Generally, the described reel assemblies may be used to close a variety of items, such as items of clothing (i.e., hats, gloves, and the like), sports apparel (boots, snowboard boots, ski boots, and the like), medical braces (i.e., back braces, knee braces, and the like), and various other items or apparel. A specific embodiment in which the closure devices may be used involves shoes, boots, and other footwear. For ease in describing the embodiments herein, the disclosure will be directed mainly to shoes although it should be realized that the closure devices may be used for the various other items.</p>
<p id="p-0043" num="0042">Referring now to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>, illustrated is a perspective view of an embodiment of lacing system <b>100</b> used for tightening a shoe <b>102</b>. The shoe can be any suitable footwear that can be tightened around a wearer's foot. The lacing system <b>100</b> can be used to close or tighten various other articles as described herein, such as, for example, a belt, a hat, a glove, snowboard bindings, a medical brace, or a bag. The lacing system can include a reel assembly <b>104</b>, a lace <b>106</b>, and one or more lace guides <b>108</b>. In the illustrated embodiment, the reel assembly <b>104</b> can be attached to the tongue <b>110</b> of the shoe. Various other configurations are also possible. For example, the reel assembly <b>104</b> can be attached to a side of the shoe <b>102</b>, which can be advantageous for shoes in which the shoe sides <b>112</b><i>a</i>-<i>b </i>are designed to be drawn closely together when tightened leaving only a small portion of the tongue <b>110</b> exposed. The reel assembly <b>104</b> can also be attached to the back of the shoe <b>102</b>, and a portion of the lace <b>106</b> can pass through the shoe <b>102</b>, sometimes using tubing for the lace to travel through, on either side of the wearer's ankle such that the lace <b>106</b> can be engaged with the reel assembly <b>104</b> when back-mounted.</p>
<p id="p-0044" num="0043"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref> is a perspective view of an embodiment of lacing system <b>200</b> that can be similar to the lacing system <b>100</b>, or any other lacing system described herein. The lacing system can include a reel assembly <b>204</b> which can be similar to the reel assembly <b>104</b>, or any other reel described herein. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref> is an exploded perspective view of the reel assembly <b>204</b>. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b></figref> is another exploded perspective view of the reel assembly <b>204</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0045" num="0044">With reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>2</b>-<b>4</b></figref>, the reel assembly <b>204</b> can include a base member <b>214</b>, a spool member <b>216</b>, and a knob <b>218</b>. The base member can include a spool housing <b>220</b> and a mounting flange <b>222</b>. The spool housing <b>220</b> can include a plurality of ratchet teeth <b>224</b>, which can extend radially inwardly. The base member <b>214</b> can include lace holes <b>226</b><i>a</i>-<i>b </i>that allow the lace <b>206</b> to enter the spool housing <b>220</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0046" num="0045">The spool member <b>216</b> can be disposed within the spool housing <b>220</b> such that the spool member <b>216</b> is rotatable about an axis <b>228</b> with respect to the spool housing <b>220</b>. The lace <b>206</b> can be secured to the spool member <b>216</b> such that when the spool member <b>216</b> rotates in a tightening direction (shown by arrow A) the lace <b>206</b> is drawn into the spool housing <b>220</b> and is wound around the channel <b>230</b> formed in the spool member <b>216</b>, and when the spool member <b>216</b> rotates in a loosening direction (shown by arrow B) the lace <b>206</b> unwinds from the channel <b>230</b> of the spool member <b>216</b> and exits the spool housing <b>220</b> via the lace holes <b>226</b><i>a</i>-<i>b</i>. The spool member <b>216</b> can also include spool teeth <b>232</b> formed thereon. It will be understood that the embodiments disclosed herein can be modified such that rotation in the direction shown by arrow B will tighten the lacing. In this particular embodiment, the knob <b>236</b> may be raised axially to disengage from spool <b>230</b> to allow the spool to freewheel in direction B in order to release the lace. In other embodiments, rotation of the knob in the direction shown by arrow B (or A) may loosen the lacing system.</p>
<p id="p-0047" num="0046">The knob <b>218</b> can be attached to the spool housing <b>220</b> such that the knob <b>218</b> can rotate about the axis <b>228</b> with respect to the spool housing <b>220</b>. The knob <b>218</b> can include knob teeth <b>234</b> that can be configured to mate with the spool teeth <b>232</b> to couple the knob <b>218</b> to the spool member <b>216</b> such that rotation of the knob <b>218</b> in the tightening direction causes the spool member <b>216</b> to also rotate in the tightening direction. In some embodiments, the rotation of the knob <b>218</b> in the loosening direction can also cause the spool member <b>216</b> to rotate in the loosening direction. The knob <b>218</b> can also include one or more pawl teeth <b>236</b> which can be biased radially outwardly so as to mate with the ratchet teeth. The pawl teeth <b>236</b> and ratchet teeth <b>224</b> can be configured so that the ratchet teeth <b>224</b> can displace the pawl teeth <b>236</b> radially inwardly when the knob <b>218</b> is rotated in the tightening direction, thereby allowing the knob <b>218</b> to rotate in the tightening direction. The pawl teeth <b>236</b> and the ratchet teeth <b>224</b> can also be configured so that they engage one another when force is applied to twist the knob <b>218</b> in the loosening direction, thereby preventing the knob <b>218</b> from rotating in the loosening direction.</p>
<p id="p-0048" num="0047">Thus, the reel assembly <b>204</b> can provide a one-way tightening system configured to allow the user to rotate the knob <b>218</b> in the tightening direction, which causes the spool member <b>216</b> to rotate in the tightening direction, which in turn causes the lace <b>206</b> to be drawn into the spool housing <b>220</b> via the lace holes <b>226</b><i>a</i>-<i>b</i>. As the lace <b>206</b> is drawn into the spool housing <b>220</b> the lacing system <b>200</b> can tighten, causing the lace guide <b>208</b> to be drawn in the direction toward the reel assembly <b>204</b> (shown by arrow C in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref>). Although the lacing system <b>200</b> is shown with a single lace guide <b>208</b>, any other suitable number of lace guides can be used. Other features of the reel and lacing system are described in U.S. Patent Application No. 2011/0266384, filed Apr. 29, 2011, and Titled &#x201c;Reel Based Lacing System&#x201d;, the entire disclosure of which is incorporated herein by reference.</p>
<p id="p-0049" num="0048">As described previously, embodiments described herein integrate one or more of the reel assembly components into a single component to reduce the component count&#x2014;i.e., number of components&#x2014;of the reel assembly. For example, one or more of the components described in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>2</b>-<b>4</b></figref> may be integrated or consolidated into a single component. Integrating or consolidating the components to reduce the overall component count simplifies the system and/or reduces cost. In some embodiments, the reel assembly may be assembled without the use of a screw or other rigid fastener, which may increase the durability and/or impact resistance of the reel assembly. For example, individual components of the reel assembly may be configured to snap into engagement with each other, thereby reducing or eliminating the need for rigid fasteners, such as screws, rivets, bolts, and the like. These and other features of the reel assemblies will be more evident with reference to the embodiments described herein below.</p>
<p id="p-0050" num="0049"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>5</b>A-B</figref> illustrate embodiments showing how an upper portion or cover with grip <b>512</b> and a lower portion or core <b>514</b> of a reel assembly's knob may be fit together into an assembly. Specifically, the cover with grip <b>512</b> may be snap fit over the core <b>514</b>. The cover with grip <b>512</b> may have an inwardly extending flange portion <b>516</b> that snaps over an outwardly extending flange <b>518</b> of the core <b>514</b>. In fitting the components together, the bottom portion of the cover with grip <b>512</b> typically deflects outward as flange <b>516</b> is fit over flange <b>518</b>. The bottom portion of the cover with grip <b>512</b> then resiliently snaps back into place to lock the cover with grip <b>512</b> about the core <b>514</b>. Since the cover with grip <b>512</b> is fit over the core <b>514</b>, the cover's flange <b>516</b> is exposed to external objects. In some situations, the flange <b>516</b> may be hit or impacted at an angle by an external object, which may cause the cover with grip <b>512</b> to become uncoupled from the core <b>514</b>. To prevent uncoupling of the components, the core <b>514</b> and/or cover with grip <b>512</b> is typically made of a robust material, such as glass filled nylon, which may be relatively expensive.</p>
<p id="p-0051" num="0050">In some embodiments, impact strength can be improved by inverting the coupling configuration. For example, uncoupling of the cover with grip from the core may be prevented or hindered by inverting the coupling configuration between the components. For example, knob <b>504</b> shows a core with grip <b>524</b> having a circumferential groove <b>526</b> within which an edge of the cover <b>522</b> fits. This knob <b>504</b> configuration is further shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b>C</figref>. The cover <b>522</b> may deflect inward or the core with grip <b>524</b> may deflect outward as the cover is pressed onto the core with grip <b>524</b>. The edge of the cover <b>522</b> may snap into the circumferential groove <b>526</b> to couple the components together. Since the connection between the components is within the core with grip <b>524</b>, the knob <b>504</b> is less susceptible to side or angled impacts that may otherwise uncouple the cover from the core. This configuration may allow for cheaper material to be used, such as ABS, nylon, or other materials. In some embodiments, the cover <b>522</b> may include a slot <b>528</b> that allows the cover <b>522</b> to be uncoupled from the core with grip <b>524</b>, such by using a flat head screw driver for leverage. In some embodiments, one or more of the components described herein (i.e., pawls, teeth, spool, and the like) may be housed within an interior of the coupled cover and core.</p>
<p id="p-0052" num="0051">Referring now to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>6</b>A-K</figref>, illustrated is a reel assembly <b>600</b> having several integrated components. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>6</b>A</figref> illustrates an exploded perspective view of the reel assembly <b>600</b>. As shown, reel assembly <b>600</b> includes a spool housing <b>602</b> having an interior portion or chamber within which most of the other components fit, such as spool <b>620</b> and pawl or drive disc <b>640</b> (hereinafter pawl disc <b>640</b>). Spool housing <b>602</b> includes a plurality of circumferentially positioned and radially inward facing ratchet teeth <b>604</b> that are configured to engage with pawl teeth <b>642</b> of pawl disc <b>640</b> as the reel assembly <b>600</b> is operated to allow lace to be wound around spool <b>620</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0053" num="0052">The pawl teeth <b>642</b> of pawl disc <b>640</b> and ratchet teeth <b>604</b> of spool housing <b>602</b> function as a ratchet mechanism that provides the one-way winding motion of the spool <b>620</b> to allow the lace to be wound around the spool. To provide the one-way ratchet mechanism, the pawl teeth <b>642</b> are configured to deflect radially inward relative to pawl disc <b>640</b> as the pawl teeth <b>642</b> rotate clockwise relative to ratchet teeth <b>604</b>. The pawl teeth <b>642</b> are biased radially outward so as to engage and lock with the ratchet teeth <b>604</b> to prevent counterclockwise rotation of the pawl disc <b>640</b> relative to spool housing <b>602</b>. As the pawl disc <b>640</b> and pawl teeth <b>642</b> are rotated relative to ratchet teeth <b>604</b>, the pawl teeth snap into position within corresponding housing teeth <b>604</b> due to the inward and outward deflection of cantilevered pawl arms, which produces an audible &#x201c;click&#x201d; sound. This sound may be tailored by adjusting a thickness of the material of pawl disc <b>640</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0054" num="0053">Pawl disc <b>640</b> also includes a plurality of axially oriented teeth <b>646</b> (see <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>6</b>B</figref>) that are configured to engage with axially oriented teeth <b>626</b> of spool <b>620</b>. The teeth, <b>646</b> and <b>626</b>, engage so that the pawl disc <b>640</b> drives, or in other words causes, clockwise rotation of the spool <b>620</b> as the pawl disc <b>640</b> is rotated clockwise (or counterclockwise) relative to spool housing <b>602</b>. As the spool <b>620</b> is rotated in this manner, lace (not shown) that is attached to the spool <b>620</b> is wound around a central portion or channel <b>625</b> of the spool <b>620</b>. To drive pawl disc <b>640</b> and spool <b>620</b> clockwise, a knob <b>660</b> is attached to the pawl disc <b>640</b> via a shaft <b>662</b> as described in more detail below. In some embodiments, the pawl disc <b>640</b> may include a keyed recess <b>648</b> into which a corresponding shaped extension or member (not shown) of the knob <b>660</b> is positioned. The keyed recess <b>648</b> and extension may function similar to teeth, <b>646</b> and <b>626</b>, to transfer rotational motion applied to the knob <b>660</b> by a user to the pawl disc <b>640</b> and spool <b>620</b>. To couple the components together (e.g., the spool <b>620</b>, pawl disc <b>640</b>, and knob <b>660</b>), shaft <b>662</b> may be inserted through a centrally located aperture <b>627</b> of spool <b>620</b> and a centrally located aperture <b>647</b> of pawl disc <b>640</b> and coupled with knob <b>660</b>. In some embodiments, the shaft <b>662</b> may be sonically welded with knob <b>660</b>, although other shaft-knob coupling arrangements are contemplated herein, such as via interference fit, adhesive bonding, heat welding, riveting, and the like.</p>
<p id="p-0055" num="0054">Pawl disc <b>640</b> provides several advantages over pawl discs of other reel assemblies. For example, the arrangement of the curved cantilever portion or member of pawl teeth <b>642</b> deflects radially outward against the ratchet teeth <b>604</b> of spool housing <b>602</b> as the lace is tensioned and/or the knob <b>660</b> is rotated backward. In this manner, the spool housing <b>602</b> supports the pawl teeth <b>642</b> as the curved cantilever portion or member presses outwardly against the spool housing <b>602</b>. Further, this configuration allows the location and orientation of the pawl teeth <b>642</b> to have a more defined and precise location relative to pawl disc <b>640</b>, which increases the synchronized engagement of the pawl teeth <b>642</b> with ratchet teeth <b>604</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0056" num="0055">In some embodiments, the spool housing <b>602</b> may include a plurality of circumferentially arranged spool housing fingers <b>606</b> or fingers that are configured to engage with an inwardly oriented flanged portion <b>668</b> of knob <b>660</b> (see <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>6</b>J</figref>) to allow the teeth, <b>626</b> and <b>646</b>, of the spool <b>620</b> and pawl disc <b>640</b> to be disengaged and thereby allow the lace to be unwound from spool <b>620</b>. Specifically, during a winding operation of reel assembly <b>600</b>, such as that described above, the flanged portion <b>668</b> of knob <b>660</b> may be positioned axially below the spool housing fingers <b>606</b>. A plurality of spool housing fingers <b>622</b> that extend radially outward from a top flanged end of spool <b>620</b> may slidingly rest on a stepped inner tab or ledge <b>608</b> of spool housing <b>602</b>. The stepped inner tab or ledge <b>608</b> of spool housing <b>602</b> prevents axially upward movement of the spool <b>620</b>, pawl disc <b>640</b>, and knob <b>660</b> relative to spool housing <b>602</b>. The spool housing fingers <b>606</b> described herein provide several advantages over other reel assembly designs. For example, the spool housing fingers <b>606</b> may include relative long preload ramps that provide improved resistance to accidental opening without increasing the overall height of the reel assembly.</p>
<p id="p-0057" num="0056">In an alternative embodiment, the spool <b>620</b> may be inserted within the spool housing <b>602</b> from a position axially below the spool housing <b>602</b>. The spool <b>620</b> may be retained within the spool housing <b>602</b> via a lower or upper flange portion (not shown). In some embodiments, the shaft <b>662</b> may be relatively short component in the axial direction so that a space is provided in a central portion of the spool <b>620</b> to allow lace attachment with the spool <b>620</b> at or near the central portion.</p>
<p id="p-0058" num="0057">As described briefly above, to unwind the lace, the teeth, <b>626</b> and <b>646</b>, of spool <b>620</b> and pawl disc <b>640</b> may be disengaged to allow the spool to freely spin or rotate counterclockwise (or clockwise in some embodiments). Disengagement of the teeth, <b>626</b> and <b>646</b>, of spool <b>620</b> and pawl disc <b>640</b> is achieved by positioning a lip <b>641</b> of pawl disc <b>640</b> axially above a ledge <b>663</b> of shaft <b>662</b> (see <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>61</b></figref>). The lip <b>641</b> has an inner diameter that is smaller than an outer diameter of ledge <b>663</b>. The shaft <b>662</b> may axially slide within a central housing of spool <b>620</b> without causing the spool to move axially upward. Accordingly, as the knob <b>660</b> is pulled axially upward, the ledge <b>663</b> of shaft <b>662</b> engages with lip <b>641</b> to force the pawl disc <b>640</b> axially upward. Axially upward movement of the pawl disc <b>640</b> disengages the pawl teeth <b>642</b> from the ratchet teeth <b>604</b> of spool housing <b>602</b> and also disengages the teeth, <b>626</b> and <b>646</b>, of the spool <b>620</b> and pawl disc <b>640</b>, thereby allowing counterclockwise rotation of the knob <b>660</b>, pawl disc <b>640</b>, and/or spool <b>620</b> relative to spool housing <b>602</b>. This disengaged configuration also allows spool <b>620</b> to rotate relative to knob <b>660</b> without causing rotation of the cap. This allows the lace (not shown) to be unwound from spool <b>620</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0059" num="0058">As the knob <b>660</b> is moved axially upward, the inwardly oriented flanged portion <b>668</b> of knob <b>660</b> press against the spool housing fingers <b>606</b> and causes the tabs to deflect radially inward. Axially upward movement of the flanged portion <b>668</b> beyond a top surface of the spool housing fingers <b>606</b> allows the spool housing fingers <b>606</b> to resiliently return to their un-deflected position or with a slight preload for a quality feel. In this arrangement, a bottom surface of the flanged portion <b>668</b> may rest on the top surface of the spool housing fingers <b>606</b> so as to maintain the disengaged configuration or relationship of knob <b>660</b> and pawl disc <b>640</b> from spool <b>620</b>. Because the flanged portion <b>668</b> may rest on the spool housing fingers <b>606</b> in this manner, the user is not required to hold the knob <b>660</b> and pawl disc <b>640</b> in the disengaged configuration. Rather, the user may pull the knob <b>660</b> axially upward so that the flanged portion <b>668</b> rests on the tab, release the knob <b>660</b>, unwind the lace from spool <b>620</b>, and then press the knob <b>660</b> downward to re-engage the pawl teeth <b>642</b> with the ratchet teeth <b>604</b> of spool housing <b>602</b> and to re-engage the teeth, <b>626</b> and <b>646</b>, of the spool <b>620</b> and pawl disc <b>640</b> so that winding of the lace may be subsequently performed as describe above. To facilitate re-engagement of the ratchet teeth and pawl teeth, each of these components may have a chamfered or angle edge that biases the ratchet teeth and pawl teeth into an engaged orientation.</p>
<p id="p-0060" num="0059"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>6</b>B and <b>6</b>C</figref> illustrate a bottom perspective view and top view of the pawl disc <b>640</b> respectively. To facilitate re-engagement of the teeth <b>646</b> with the teeth <b>626</b> of spool <b>620</b>, the teeth <b>646</b> (and teeth <b>626</b>) may have an angled configuration on one side as shown. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>6</b>D and <b>6</b>E</figref> show a perspective view and a side view, respectively, of spool housing <b>602</b>.

Base member <b>702</b> may also include a central shaft <b>719</b> about which the spool <b>704</b> and/or core <b>706</b> rotate and/or with which the coupling mechanism <b>711</b> attaches, such as by threading a screw <b>711</b> into the shaft <b>719</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0062" num="0061">Lace (not shown) may be wound around the spool <b>704</b> as previously described and the spool <b>704</b> may include teeth <b>718</b> that couple with corresponding teeth of pawl disc with spring <b>708</b> or core <b>706</b>. In some embodiments, pawl disc with spring <b>708</b> may include a centrally located spring <b>715</b> that couples with a bushing <b>710</b>. In some embodiments the central spring may be formed of a compliant or resilient material that deflects as the bushing <b>710</b> is pushed through a central lumen of the pawl disc with spring <b>708</b>. After the bushing <b>710</b> is inserted through the central lumen, the resilient material of pawl disc with spring <b>708</b> may press against the bushing <b>710</b> to couple the components together. The screw <b>711</b> may be inserted through the bushing <b>710</b> and coupled through the spool <b>704</b> to base member <b>702</b>. Cover with grip <b>712</b> fits over the assembly and couples with the base member <b>702</b> to cover the assembly and provide a component that the user can grip and rotate to wind the lace.</p>
<p id="p-0063" num="0062">Referring now to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>7</b>B and <b>7</b>C</figref>, illustrated is another embodiment of a reel assembly. The reel assembly of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>7</b>B and <b>7</b>C</figref> is similar to that described in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>7</b>A</figref> in that the reel assembly includes a base member <b>742</b>, a spool <b>744</b>, a cover <b>750</b> and a coupling mechanism, such as a screw <b>748</b> and bushing <b>747</b>. The reel assembly of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>7</b>B and <b>7</b>C</figref> differs from reel assembly <b>700</b> in that the system includes an integrated spool housing with pawl disc <b>746</b>. The outer cylindrical body portion of the spool housing with pawl disc <b>746</b> fits over the outer cylindrical wall of base member <b>742</b> and is rotatable relative thereto by a user grasping the outer cylindrical body. The pawl disc portion of the spool housing with pawl disc <b>746</b> fits within the inner cylindrical wall of base member <b>742</b> such that the pawl teeth are able to engage with the ratchet teeth of base member <b>742</b> to wind and unwind lace from the spool <b>744</b> as described herein. The cover <b>750</b> may be similar to those described in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b>A</figref>, and is coupled with an interior portion of cylindrical body of spool housing with pawl disc <b>746</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0064" num="0063">Referring now to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>8</b>A-L</figref>, illustrated is another embodiment of a reel assembly <b>800</b> with integrated components. Similar to some of the other reel assemblies described herein, reel assembly <b>800</b> includes a spool housing <b>802</b> that releasably couples with a bayonet <b>804</b>, which may be coupled with a shoe, brace, or other apparel or device via stitching, adhesive bonding, molding, and the like. In some embodiments, to releasably couple the spool housing <b>802</b> and bayonet <b>804</b>, the bayonet <b>804</b> may include a tab <b>803</b> having a hooked portion facing inward or outward that fits within a recess <b>811</b> of a bottom flanged portion of the spool housing <b>802</b>. The tab <b>803</b> may be pulled or pushed to remove the hooked portion from the recess to allow the spool housing and other components of the reel assembly <b>800</b> to be released from the bayonet. Uncoupling of the reel assembly <b>800</b> may be performed to replace the reel assembly, to replace the lace of the reel assembly, or for maintenance or other purposes.</p>
<p id="p-0065" num="0064">Reel assembly <b>800</b> also includes a spool with pawls <b>806</b> that fits within the spool housing <b>802</b>. Unlike the other reel assemblies described herein, reel assembly <b>800</b> does not include a separate pawl disc. Rather, the pawl teeth <b>805</b> are integrated with the spool with pawls <b>806</b> into a single component, thereby reducing the component count of reel assembly <b>800</b>. As previously described, the pawl teeth <b>805</b> are biased radially outward with curved spring elements to cause the pawl teeth <b>805</b> to engage with ratchet teeth <b>807</b> of the spool housing to provide the one-way ratchet motion previously described.</p>
<p id="p-0066" num="0065">Reel assembly <b>800</b> also includes a cover with grip <b>808</b> as previously described. The spool housing <b>802</b> includes spool housing fingers <b>801</b> that are spaced circumferentially around the body of the spool housing <b>802</b>. In some embodiments, the fingers <b>801</b> may be an annular flange that partially or fully surrounds the spool housing <b>802</b>. The fingers <b>801</b> will be referred to hereinafter as flange <b>801</b>. The spool housing flange <b>801</b> interacts with a corresponding flange or grooved interior channel (see <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>8</b>D-I</figref>) of the cover with grip <b>808</b> as previously described to allow the cover with grip to be pulled axially upward and maintained in an axially raised orientation relative to the spool with pawls to disengage the pawl teeth <b>805</b> and ratchet teeth <b>807</b> and thereby allow lace <b>820</b> (see <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>8</b>C-E</figref>) to be unwound from the spool with pawls <b>806</b>. To couple the components together, a shaft <b>810</b> may be attached to a central cylindrical element (see <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>8</b>D-I</figref>) of the cover with grip <b>808</b> via sonic welding, adhesive bonding, press fitting, and the like.</p>
<p id="p-0067" num="0066">In some embodiments, the spool with pawls <b>806</b> may include a plurality of teeth <b>817</b> positioned on a top surface that engage and interact with teeth (not shown) positioned within an interior portion of the cover with grip <b>808</b>. In another embodiment, the cover with grip <b>808</b> may include a spline <b>814</b> (see <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>8</b>F-I</figref>) that engages with the spool with pawls <b>806</b>. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>8</b>F-H</figref>, as the cover with grip <b>808</b> is first pulled axially upward, friction between the spline <b>814</b> and an aperture <b>813</b> of the spool with pawls <b>806</b> causes the spool to move axially upward to a disengaged position (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>8</b>G</figref>) at which point the integrated pawl teeth are retracted from the ratchet teeth of the housing. At this point the user could incrementally unwind lace if desired and push the cover with grip <b>808</b> axially downward to the closed position in which the pawls are reengaged with the ratchet teeth. To fully release the spool with pawls <b>806</b>, the cover with grip <b>808</b> may be pulled further axially upward to a second position (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>8</b>H</figref>) at which the pawl teeth disengage from the ratchet teeth and the spline <b>814</b> is disengaged from the aperture <b>813</b>, which allows the spool with pawls <b>806</b> to freewheel or freely spin/rotate while the cover with grip <b>808</b> remains stationary.</p>
<p id="p-0068" num="0067">To allow the spline <b>814</b> to be disengaged from the aperture <b>813</b>, the shaft <b>810</b> may be coupled axially below a lipped portion <b>821</b> of the spool with pawls <b>806</b> as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>8</b>F</figref>. This allows the shaft <b>810</b> to travel axially upward a desired distance before disengaging the spline <b>814</b> from the aperture <b>813</b>. Frictional engagement of the spline <b>814</b> and aperture <b>813</b> causes the pawl teeth <b>805</b> to be disengaged from the ratchet teeth <b>807</b> via pulling on the cover with grip <b>808</b> as previously described. Positioning the shaft <b>810</b> axially below the lipped portion <b>821</b> may also reduce an amount of &#x201c;wobble&#x201d; of the cover with grip <b>808</b> of reel assembly <b>800</b> providing a benefit over other reel assemblies. In other embodiments, the shaft <b>810</b> may be coupled immediately below the lipped portion <b>821</b> of the spool with pawls <b>806</b> so that any upward axial motion of the cover with grip <b>808</b> is transferred to the spool with pawls <b>806</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0069" num="0068">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>8</b>F-H</figref>, in some embodiments, the spool housing flange <b>801</b> may include two outwardly extending flanges (not shown) that are configured to hold the cover with grip <b>808</b> in a first position in which the spline <b>814</b> is disengaged from the aperture <b>813</b> and in a second position in which the spline <b>814</b> is disengaged from the aperture <b>813</b> and in which the pawl teeth <b>805</b> are disengaged from the ratchet teeth <b>807</b>. In other embodiments, the spool housing <b>802</b> may include circumferential grooves (not shown) in place of the spool housing fingers <b>801</b>. A flanged portion of the cover with grip <b>808</b> may fit within the circumferential grooves of the spool housing <b>802</b> and as the cover with grip <b>808</b> is pulled axially upward, the flanged portion may slide into another circumferential groove to hold the cover with grip <b>808</b> and any coupled components in an axially raised orientation. In some embodiments, this configuration may allow the cover with grip <b>808</b> to be removed without the use of a tool. Removing the cover with grip <b>808</b> allows the spool to be exposed and lace to be easily removed and retied or attached to the spool, such as for replacement.</p>
<p id="p-0070" num="0069">As previously described, in some embodiments, the reel assembly <b>800</b> may be removed to replace the lace <b>820</b> of the reel assembly. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>8</b>B-E</figref> illustrates one embodiment in which the lace <b>820</b> may be replaced. Specifically, the spool housing <b>802</b> may include apertures <b>823</b> through which the lace <b>820</b> is fed or threaded. The spool with pawls <b>806</b> may likewise include apertures <b>822</b> through which the lace <b>820</b> is fed or threaded. In such embodiments, the apertures, <b>822</b> and <b>823</b>, of the spool with pawls <b>806</b> and spool housing <b>802</b>, respectively, may be aligned and the lace <b>820</b> fed through the two apertures, either from the reel assemblies exterior or the interior regions. A knot may be tied in the lace <b>820</b> that is unable to pass through the apertures <b>822</b> of the spool with pawls <b>806</b> so as to couple the lace with the spool. In this manner, replacement of the lace <b>820</b> is relatively quick, convenient, and easy. In some embodiments, the spool with pawls <b>806</b> may include slots instead of apertures <b>822</b>. The slots may extend from a bottom edge of the spool with pawls <b>806</b> axially upward to allow the lace <b>820</b> to be slid within the slot during lace replacement.</p>
<p id="p-0071" num="0070"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>8</b>J-L</figref> illustrates the integrated spool with pawls <b>806</b> and pawl teeth <b>805</b> of reel assembly <b>800</b> in greater detail. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>8</b>B and <b>81</b></figref> illustrate a method of assembling the components of reel assembly <b>800</b>. For example, to assemble the components, the spool with pawls <b>806</b> and shaft <b>810</b> may be positioned below the spool housing <b>802</b>. The spool with pawls <b>806</b> may then be inserted within a chamber of the spool housing <b>802</b> and moved axially upward relative to the spool housing until the pawl teeth <b>805</b> are positioned adjacent the ratchet teeth <b>807</b> of spool housing <b>802</b>. To facilitate insertion of the spool with pawls <b>806</b> within the spool housing <b>802</b>, the spool housing may include a ramped or angled portion <b>816</b> that is configured to deflect the pawl teeth <b>805</b> inwardly around a bottom edge of the ratchet teeth <b>807</b>. As the pawl teeth <b>805</b> are pushed upward adjacent the ratchet teeth <b>807</b>, the pawl teeth may spring radially outward to engage with the ratchet teeth <b>807</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0072" num="0071">The cover with grip <b>808</b> may then be inserted over the spool with pawls <b>806</b> and spool housing <b>802</b> so that a shaft or slug <b>824</b> is inserted through a central aperture of the spool. The spline <b>814</b> is inserted within the aperture <b>813</b> of spool with pawls <b>806</b>. The shaft <b>810</b> may then be inserted through the central aperture of spool with pawls <b>806</b> until the shaft <b>810</b> contacts the slug <b>824</b>. The shaft <b>810</b> and slug <b>824</b> may then be coupled together via sonic welding, adhesive bonding, riveting, heat welding, and the like. Lace may then be fed through the spool with pawls and spool housing and the coupled components may be releasably attached to a bayonet <b>804</b> that is coupled with a shoe, brace, or other device or apparel.</p>
<p id="p-0073" num="0072">In some embodiments, an interior diameter <b>817</b> of the spool housing <b>802</b> may uniform so that the spool housing does not need to include ramped portion <b>816</b>. Rather, the pawl teeth <b>805</b> may be inwardly deflected prior to inserting the spool with pawls <b>806</b> within spool housing <b>802</b>. The spool with pawls may then be moved axially upward until the pawl teeth <b>805</b> deflect radially outward and engage with the ratchet teeth <b>807</b>. The remaining assembly process may be the same as that previously described.</p>
<p id="p-0074" num="0073">Referring now to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>9</b>A-O</figref>, illustrated are various other embodiments of reels systems and reel assembly components. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>9</b>A</figref> illustrates a reel assembly <b>900</b> where several of the components integrated into the knob <b>902</b>. Specifically, the knob <b>902</b> includes knob assembly fingers <b>903</b> that function similar to the spool housing fingers (i.e., <b>606</b>) described in previous embodiments. The knob assembly fingers <b>903</b> are configured to fit over the body of spool housing <b>906</b> and slip over ridge <b>908</b> to hold or maintain the knob <b>902</b> in a raised position in which lace (not shown) can be unwound from spool <b>910</b> or in an engaged position in which pawl teeth <b>904</b> of knob <b>902</b> are engaged with ratchet teeth <b>907</b> of spool housing <b>906</b>. The knob assembly fingers <b>903</b> may snap into position as the fingers are pressed or pulled over ridge <b>908</b>. The fingers <b>903</b> on the knob eliminate openings in the spool housing <b>906</b> making it more difficult for dirt and debris to enter therein. The knob <b>902</b> also includes spool teeth <b>905</b> that engage with clutch teeth <b>909</b> of spool <b>910</b> to facilitate winding of the spool. The spool teeth <b>905</b> disengage from teeth <b>909</b> when the knob <b>902</b> is in the axially raised position. A pawl disc is incorporated into the knob <b>902</b>. In some embodiments, a pawl disc or mechanism may be snap fit into an interior portion of the knob <b>902</b>. In other embodiments, the pawl disc or mechanism may be may be sonically welded, adhered, or otherwise coupled with the knob <b>902</b> or pawl mechanism features may be molded into the knob. The knob <b>902</b>, or any of the other caps described herein, may also include grip features on its exterior surface that allow for improved feel and/or grip ability.</p>
<p id="p-0075" num="0074">As is evident with reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>9</b>A</figref>, when tension is applied to the lace, the rotational force of spool <b>910</b> is transferred to the knob <b>902</b> via interaction between teeth <b>909</b> and spool teeth <b>905</b>. This force is in turn transferred to spool housing <b>906</b> via interaction between the pawl teeth <b>904</b> and ratchet teeth <b>907</b>. Since the pawl teeth <b>904</b> deflect inwardly as the knob is rotated to wind the lace, the pawl teeth make a clicking noise when the knob <b>902</b> is turned to wind the lace about spool <b>910</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0076" num="0075">As previously described, the spool housing <b>906</b> includes an aperture (not numbered) that allows the lace to exit the spool housing. The geometry of the aperture may be configured to prolong the life of the lace. Similarly, the spool <b>910</b> includes a lace attachment method, such as the previously described apertures or slots. In one embodiment, the components of reel assembly <b>900</b> may be assembled by attaching the knob <b>902</b> and pawl mechanism or knob core via snap fitting or other methods. Lace may then be inserted through the lace exits (i.e., aperture) of the spool housing <b>906</b> inwardly and attached to the spool <b>910</b>. The lace may then be pulled tight to seat the spool <b>910</b> into the body of the spool housing <b>906</b>. The spool housing <b>906</b> may then be attached to a bayonet <b>912</b>. The knob <b>902</b> may then be snapped onto the spool housing <b>906</b> by applying pressure until the knob assembly fingers <b>903</b> clear ridge <b>908</b> surrounding the outer diameter of spool housing <b>906</b>.</p>

<p id="p-0080" num="0079"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>9</b>G-I</figref> illustrate another embodiment of a reel assembly. Unlike other embodiments, the spool <b>974</b> of the reel assembly is indirectly coupled with the spool housing <b>972</b>. For example, the spool <b>974</b> includes a slug <b>975</b> positioned near its top surface. Slug <b>975</b> is inserted through an aperture of spool housing <b>972</b> and coupled with a dart <b>979</b> or plug of a cover <b>976</b> that is in turn coupled with the spool housing <b>972</b> such as by inserting edges of the cover <b>976</b> within an interior groove of spool housing <b>972</b>. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>91</b></figref>, the slug <b>975</b> includes expanding barbs that expand and fit over the dart <b>979</b> as the components are pressed together. As the barbs expand, the slug <b>975</b> becomes too large to fit through the aperture of spool housing <b>972</b>, thereby locking the spool <b>974</b> in place relative to spool housing <b>972</b>.

The central boss of the coupling component <b>1210</b> may be snapped into engagement with an aperture of the pawl disc <b>1204</b> and the assembled reel assembly <b>1200</b> may be snapped into engagement with the bayonet <b>1212</b> that is positioned on a shoe or other article to be tightened. In such an embodiment, assembly of the reel assembly <b>1200</b> entirely or substantially involves snapping the various components into engagement and does not include the use of a screw, rivet, or other rigid fastener.</p>
<p id="p-0105" num="0104">The part or component count of the reel assembly <b>1200</b> is also minimal, which reduces the overall manufacturing costs in producing and/or assembly the reel assembly <b>1200</b>. For example, the component count of the reel assembly <b>1200</b> may be no more than about six components including: the knob <b>1202</b>, the pawl disc <b>1204</b>, the spool housing <b>1206</b>, the spool <b>1208</b>, and the coupling component <b>1210</b>. In some embodiments, the bayonet <b>1212</b> may also be included in the component count. In some embodiments the reel assembly <b>1200</b> may have no more than five components and/or some of the previously described components could be combined or integrated. For example, the pawl disc <b>1204</b> could be integrated or combined with the spool <b>1208</b>. In another embodiment, the coupling component <b>1210</b>, and specifically the central boss that allows the assembly to remain in the engaged or disengaged position, could be integrated or combined with the spool <b>1208</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0106" num="0105">In some embodiments, one or more of the above components may include two or more parts that are coupled together. For example, the knob may include a main body and a grip body that is positioned on a circumferential edge of the main body. The grip body may have a coefficient of friction that is greater than the main body to enable gripping of the knob <b>1202</b>. In another embodiment, the bayonet <b>1212</b> may include a mounting feature that is configured for releasably coupling with the spool housing <b>1206</b> and may include an attachment feature (e.g., stitch flange) that is configured for coupling with a shoe or other article. The mounting feature may be made of a first material and the attachment feature may be made of a second material that is softer than the first material. The softer second material may enable easy coupling or attachment of the bayonet <b>1212</b> to the shoe or other article, while the more rigid first material provides a rigid feature that enables or facilitates coupling of the bayonet with the spool housing <b>1206</b>. The separate components or members may be integrally formed together via two shot molding, rf welding, sonic welding, and the like so that the resulting component is essentially similar to or functions as a single piece component.</p>
<p id="p-0107" num="0106"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>12</b>J</figref> illustrates one embodiment in which the spool housing <b>1206</b> may be removably coupled with bayonet <b>1212</b>. In this embodiment, one or more interlocking tabs <b>1226</b> of spool housing <b>1206</b> may be positioned under an undercut or grooved portion <b>1225</b> of bayonet <b>1212</b>. One of the undercuts <b>1225</b> may be formed from, or otherwise defined by, a pressable tab or button <b>1228</b>. The tab <b>1226</b> is able to be released or removed from the undercut <b>1225</b> when the button <b>1228</b> is pressed. In this manner, the spool housing <b>1226</b> and other components of reel assembly <b>1200</b> may be detached from bayonet <b>1212</b> as desired.</p>
<p id="p-0108" num="0107">Referring now to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>12</b>K and <b>12</b>L</figref>, illustrated is an embodiment of the coupling component <b>1210</b> being used to facilitate in opening and closing of the knob <b>1202</b> so as to allow the spool <b>1208</b>, and any lace coupled therewith, to be unwound or rotated in a reverse direction. Stated differently, the coupling component is being used to move the pawl disc between an engaged and disengaged state that allow the lace tension to be released. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>12</b><i>k </i></figref>and <b>121</b> also illustrate the coupling component <b>1210</b> coupled with the pawl disc <b>1204</b> to lock or otherwise couple the components of the reel assembly <b>1200</b> together as previously described.</p>
<p id="p-0109" num="0108"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>12</b>K</figref> illustrates the knob <b>1202</b> positioned in a lowered configuration relative to spool housing <b>1206</b>. In this configuration, a flange or bushing <b>1232</b> of pawl disc <b>1204</b> is positioned within a first annular groove of coupling component <b>1210</b>, or positioned below a radial protrusion or feature of the coupling component's central boss. The positioning of the bushing <b>1232</b> within the coupling component <b>1210</b>'s first annular groove, or below the radial protrusion, holds or otherwise maintains the knob <b>1202</b> in the lowered configuration relative to spool housing <b>1206</b>. In the lowered configuration the pawl teeth of pawl disc <b>1204</b> engage with the ratchet teeth of spool housing <b>1206</b> as described herein to allow the spool <b>1208</b> to be wound in a ratchet like manner.</p>
<p id="p-0110" num="0109"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>12</b>L</figref> illustrates the knob <b>1202</b> positioned in a raised configuration in which the knob <b>1202</b> and pawl disc <b>1204</b> are moved axially upward relative to spool housing <b>1206</b>, spool <b>1208</b>, and coupling component <b>1210</b>. In the raised configuration, the bushing <b>1232</b> of pawl disc <b>1204</b> is moved axially upward and out of the coupling component <b>1210</b>'s first annular groove and into a second annular groove of coupling component <b>1210</b>. In other embodiments, the bushing <b>1232</b> is axially raised so as to be positioned above the radial protrusion or feature of the coupling component's central boss. The positioning of the bushing <b>1232</b> within the coupling component <b>1210</b>'s second annular groove, or above the radial protrusion, holds or otherwise maintains the knob <b>1202</b> and pawl disc <b>1204</b> in the raised configuration relative to spool housing <b>1206</b>. In the raised configuration the pawl teeth of pawl disc <b>1204</b> are disengaged from the ratchet teeth of spool housing <b>1206</b> as described herein.</p>
<p id="p-0111" num="0110"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>12</b>L</figref> also illustrates that an interaction between the flange <b>1222</b> and annular ridge <b>1223</b> prevents further upward axial movement of the knob <b>1202</b> and pawl disc <b>1204</b> relative to spool housing <b>1206</b>, and thereby prevents the knob <b>1202</b> from being detached from spool housing <b>1206</b>. To enable the bushing <b>1232</b> of the pawl disc <b>1204</b> to be moved axially above or below the radial protrusion or feature of the coupling component <b>1210</b>, the coupling component's central boss includes two members that extend axially upwards into the spool housing's interior region. The two members have a forked shaped configuration wherein the two members are disconnected so as to allow the two members to flex radially inward as the bushing <b>1232</b> is moved axially upward and downward. In this manner, the coupling component's central boss functions as a spring to allow the knob <b>1202</b> and pawl disc <b>1204</b> to be axially moved and maintained in an axially raised or lower position.</p>
<p id="p-0112" num="0111">The forked shaped central boss may be configured to ensure there is no or limited &#x201c;slop&#x201d; or rattle between the knob <b>1202</b> and the spool housing <b>1206</b>. This is achieved by the interaction of the geometry of the central boss's forked profile and the pawl disc's bushing <b>1232</b>, which have a preload/interference between one another. A &#x201c;transition point&#x201d; on the central boss's profile is important to reduce unintentional opening or axially movement of the knob <b>1202</b>. The &#x201c;transition point&#x201d; refers to the widest portion of the central boss's radial protrusion. The central boss is configured so that the transition point is positioned axially upward from the bushing <b>1232</b> when the assembly is engaged or closed&#x2014;i.e., when the assembly is in the lowered position. As such, when the knob <b>1202</b> is side loaded, which causes the knob <b>1202</b> to tilt slightly upward, the bushing <b>1232</b> remains below the central boss's transition point thereby keeping the assembly engaged or closed. The central boss's radial protrusion is also angled axially above and below the transition point to help ensure that the knob <b>1202</b> and other components remain in the open/disengaged position or the closed/engaged position as desired. The configuration and positioning of the bushing <b>1232</b> and transition point ensures that if the bushing <b>1232</b> is positioned axially above the transition point, the knob <b>1202</b> and other components will remain open/disengaged. In contrast, if the busing <b>1232</b> is positioned axially below the transition point, the knob <b>1202</b> and other components will remain closed/engaged. In some embodiments, the central boss may be made of a reinforced polymer material (e.g., 25% GF POM) to provide a sufficient stiffness and ductility, which aids in maintaining the knob <b>1202</b> and other components in the open/disengaged position or the closed/engaged position as desired.</p>
<p id="p-0113" num="0112">In some embodiments, the knob <b>1202</b> and pawl disc <b>1204</b> may be axially raised or lowered by pushing or pulling on the knob <b>1202</b>. In other embodiment, the knob <b>1202</b> and pawl disc <b>1204</b> may be axially raised or lowered by rotating the knob <b>1202</b> in the second direction (e.g., counterclockwise) and/or by pushing a button or other mechanism.</p>
<p id="p-0114" num="0113">To facilitate in disengagement of the pawl teeth from the ratchet teeth, the pawl disc <b>1204</b> includes tabs <b>1236</b> that are positioned at a distal end of pawl teeth arms <b>1235</b> as described herein. As the pawl disc <b>1204</b> is pulled axially upward, such as via knob <b>1202</b>, the tabs <b>1236</b> pull upward on the pawl teeth to facilitate disengagement of the pawl teeth from the ratchet teeth. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>12</b>M and <b>12</b>N</figref> illustrate the pawl disc <b>1204</b> in greater detail and also illustrates the pawl disc <b>1204</b> interacting with the coupling component <b>1210</b> while the pawl teeth are engaged with the ratchet teeth.</p>
<p id="p-0115" num="0114"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>120</b></figref> illustrates a similar embodiment of a reel assembly <b>1200</b> having the various components described above. The embodiment of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>120</b></figref> differs, however, in that lace entrance and exit ports <b>1237</b> are positioned on the spool housing <b>1206</b> instead of on the bayonet <b>1212</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0116" num="0115">According to one embodiment, a method of assembling a reel assembly includes coupling a drive component (e.g., pawl disc) with a tightening component (e.g., knob). The method also includes coupling the tightening component with a top end of a housing (e.g., spool housing) so that the drive component faces an interior region of the housing. The method additionally includes inserting a spool component (e.g., spool) within a bottom end of the housing so that the spool component is positioned within the interior region of the housing and so that a top end of the spool component faces a bottom surface of the drive component. The method additionally includes coupling an attachment component with the bottom end of the housing. The attachment component includes a coupling member that couples with the drive component. Coupling the coupling member with the drive component may operationally couple the drive component and the spool component so that operation of the tightening component causes the spool component to rotate within the housing in a first direction while preventing rotation of the spool component in a second direction.</p>
<p id="p-0117" num="0116">In some embodiments, one or more of the various components are assembled or coupled so that the reel assembly is free of a screw or other rigid fastener. In some embodiments, coupling the drive component with the tightening component includes snapping the drive component into a recessed portion of the tightening component. In some embodiments, coupling the tightening component with the top end of the housing includes snapping a lip of the tightening component over a corresponding lip of the housing. In some embodiments, coupling the attachment component with the bottom end of the housing includes snapping a flange of the attachment component within an aperture of the housing. In some embodiments, the method may additionally include snapping the attachment component's coupling member within an aperture of the drive component to couple said components together and/or the method may include coupling the assembled reel assembly with a mounting component that is positioned on an article to be tightened with the reel assembly.</p>
<p id="p-0118" num="0117">In one embodiment, a reel assembly for tightening a shoe or other article includes a housing having an interior region and a partition that divides the interior region into an upper portion and a lower portion and a spool rotatably positioned within the lower portion of the housing's interior region axially below the partition. The partition may prevent the spool from axially moving upward into the upper portion. The reel assembly also includes a drive component that is positioned within the upper portion of the housing's interior region. The drive component may be axially moveable relative to the spool between an engaged state and a disengaged state. In the engaged state, the drive component allows the spool to rotate in a first direction within the housing's interior region while preventing rotation of the spool component in a second direction. In the disengaged state, the drive component allows the spool to rotate in the second direction within the housing's interior region.</p>
<p id="p-0119" num="0118">The reel assembly also includes a tightening component that is positioned axially above the drive component and coupled therewith so that operation of the tightening component causes the spool to rotate within the housing's interior region in the first direction. The reel assembly further includes an attachment component that is positioned axially below the spool. The attachment component includes a coupling member that protrudes axially upward into the interior region of the housing and couples with the drive component.</p>
<p id="p-0120" num="0119">Other embodiments described herein provide closure system components that enable a tension member to be quickly and easily coupled with the closure system. As described previously, the closure system includes a tensioning component that may be operated to tension the tension member. An exemplary tensioning component is a knob that may be grasped and rotated to tension the tension member. Other tensioning components include pull cords, motorized devices, and the like.</p>
<p id="p-0121" num="0120">The closure system's tensioning component needs to be coupled with the tension member or lace so that operation of the tensioning component effects tensioning of the tension member. Coupling the tension member with the tensioning component in conventional systems is often tedious and/or difficult. For example, conventional systems often require a substantial amount of disassembly of the closure system in order to couple the tensioning component and tension member. Further, replacement of the tension member is sometimes required after considerable usage of the closure system. Replacement of the tension member may require the use of special tools and/or considerable disassembly of the closure system. The embodiments described herein provide a means for quickly and conveniently coupling a tension member with the closure system's tensioning component and/or other components, which greatly reduces the time and money associated with manufacturing the closure systems as well as reduces the time and effort necessary to replace the tension member.</p>
<p id="p-0122" num="0121">As an example of a reel based tensioning device that may be configured for quick and easy lace attachment, a housing component of the reel based tensioning device may have an interior region within which one or more other components of the reel based tensioning device are positionable and may also have a first aperture that provides a first access to the interior region from an exterior of the housing component and a second aperture that provides a second access to the interior region from the exterior of the housing component. A spool component of the reel based tensioning device may be positionable within the interior region of the housing component and may include a central cylindrical portion and a pair of flanges that are positioned on opposing ends of the central cylindrical portion with each flange extending radially outward from the central cylindrical portion. A lumen may extend through the central cylindrical portion of the spool component. Opposing ends of the lumen may be alignable with the first aperture and with the second aperture of the housing component to enable a lace to be inserted through the first aperture, through the lumen, and through the second aperture so that opposing ends of the lace are positioned exterior to the housing component while a portion of the lace is disposed within the interior region of the housing component and within the lumen of the spool component.</p>
<p id="p-0123" num="0122">In some embodiments, the lumen may have a tapered region that is configured to engage with a knot that is tied in a distal end of the lace as the lace is retracted through the second aperture and within the lumen of the central cylindrical portion. A narrow portion of the lumen's tapered region may include an engagement feature, such as a notch or pocket, within which the knot engages to prevent uncoupling of the lace and spool component. The lumen may be positioned on one side of the central cylindrical component and an additional lumen may be positioned on an opposite side of the central cylindrical component. In such embodiments, opposing ends of the additional lumen may be alignable with the second aperture of the housing component and with a third aperture of the housing component to enable an additional lace to be inserted through the third aperture, through the lumen, and through the second aperture so that opposing ends of the additional lace are positioned exterior to the housing component while a portion of the additional lace is disposed within the interior region of the housing component and within the additional lumen of the spool component.</p>
<p id="p-0124" num="0123">In some embodiments, an axis of the first aperture may be angled relative to an axis of the second aperture so that the axes of the tow apertures are offset or non-parallel. The housing component may include a knot securement member within which the knot is positionable so that tensioning of the lace causes the knot to cinch down on itself. The lumen may be configured to guide the lace along a non-parallel or non-straight path between the first aperture and the second aperture of the housing component. The spool component and the housing component may each include indicia that are alignable to indicate when the opposing ends of the lumen are aligned with the first aperture and the second aperture of the housing component.</p>
<p id="p-0125" num="0124">According to another example of a lace tensioning device that may be configured for quick and easy coupling of the lace, a housing component of the lace tensioning device may have an interior region, a first aperture, and a second aperture. A spool component of the lace tensioning device may be rotatably positionable within the interior region of the housing component and may have a central cylindrical member and a lumen that extends through the central cylindrical portion. The spool may be rotatable within the interior region of the housing component to align one end of the lumen with the first aperture and to align an opposite end of the lumen with the second aperture to enable a lace to be inserted through the first aperture, the lumen, and the second aperture so that opposing ends of the lace are positioned exterior to the housing component.</p>
<p id="p-0126" num="0125">The lumen that extends through the central cylindrical portion may have a tapered region that is configured to engage with a knot that is tied in a distal end of the lace as the lace is retracted through the second aperture and within the lumen of the central cylindrical portion. A narrow portion of the lumen's tapered region may include a lace engagement feature, such as a notch or pocket, within which the knot engages to prevent uncoupling of the lace and spool component. An axis of the first aperture may be angled relative to an axis of the second aperture so that the axes of the two apertures are not aligned. The first aperture may be positioned toward a front portion of the housing component and the second aperture may be positioned toward a rear portion of the housing component so that when the lace is inserted through the first aperture, the lumen, and the second aperture, the lace extends from the front portion of the housing component, through the spool component, and rearward of the rear portion of the housing component. The housing component may include a knot securement member within which the knot is positionable so that tensioning of the lace causes the knot to cinch down on itself.</p>
<p id="p-0127" num="0126">Referring now to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>13</b></figref>, illustrated is an exemplary embodiment of a closure system <b>1300</b> that includes various components that enable a tension member or lace (hereinafter lace) to be easily coupled or attached to one or more components of the closure system. The closure system <b>1300</b> includes a base or bayonet <b>1330</b> that may be coupled with an article via a flange <b>1331</b>. The flange <b>1331</b> may be stitched, adhered, heat bonded, mechanically fastened, or otherwise attached to the article. Removably coupled with the bayonet <b>1330</b> is a housing <b>1320</b>. A spool <b>1310</b> is positioned within the housing <b>1320</b> and a knob or reel <b>1302</b> (hereinafter knob <b>1302</b>) is positioned atop housing <b>1320</b>. Knob <b>1302</b> is operationally coupled with the spool <b>1310</b> so that operation of the knob <b>1302</b>, and specifically rotation of the knob <b>1302</b>, effects or causes rotation of the spool <b>1310</b> within the housing <b>1320</b>. A coupling component <b>1340</b> is positioned axially below the bayonet <b>1330</b> and is used to hold or maintain the knob <b>1302</b> in an axially raised or lowered position.</p>
<p id="p-0128" num="0127"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>14</b>A-<b>18</b>B</figref> illustrate top and bottom perspective views of the various components of closure system <b>1300</b>. For example, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>16</b>A and <b>16</b>B</figref> illustrate the bayonet <b>1330</b>. The bayonet <b>1330</b> includes a recessed or open portion <b>1332</b> within which the coupling component <b>1340</b> is positioned. The coupling component <b>1340</b> includes laterally extending arms <b>1344</b> that matingly engage with the bayonet <b>1330</b> to prevent the coupling component <b>1340</b> from being pulled axially upward and out of engagement with the bayonet <b>1330</b>. The coupling component <b>1340</b> also includes an axially extending post <b>1342</b> that extends axially upward from the bayonet <b>1330</b> when the coupling component <b>1340</b> and bayonet <b>1330</b> are coupled together. The axially extending post <b>1342</b> is disposed through a central aperture of the spool <b>1310</b> and matingly engages with the knob <b>1302</b> to hold or maintain the knob <b>1302</b> in an axially raised or lowered position. Specifically, the axially extending post <b>1342</b> has a radially outward extending tip that is positioned within and engages a central aperture <b>1305</b> of the knob <b>1302</b>, which is illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>15</b>B</figref>. In operation, the radially outward extending tip of the coupling component <b>1340</b> is positioned within the central aperture <b>1305</b> and axially above a smaller diameter annular inward extending surface of the central aperture <b>1305</b>. Because the tip of coupling component <b>1340</b> is positioned axially above the smaller diameter annular surface of central aperture <b>1305</b>, the tip of coupling component <b>1340</b> maintains the knob <b>1302</b> in a lowered position. If the user grasps the knob <b>1302</b> and pulls axially upward on the knob, the annular inward extending surface of the central aperture deflects the coupling component's tip inward and moves axially upward and above the tip of coupling component <b>1340</b>. In this instance, because the coupling component's radially outward extending tip is positioned axially below the smaller diameter central aperture <b>1305</b>, the central post <b>1342</b> and radially extending tip maintain the knob in a raised position.</p>
<p id="p-0129" num="0128">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>15</b>B</figref>, the knob includes axially extending teeth <b>1304</b> that are configured to engage with corresponding axially extending teeth <b>1313</b> of the spool <b>1310</b>. When the knob <b>1302</b> is positioned in the axially lowered position, the axially extending teeth <b>1304</b> of the knob <b>1302</b> matingly engage with the corresponding axially extending teeth <b>1313</b> of the spool <b>1310</b>. Engagement of the corresponding teeth of the knob <b>1302</b> and spool <b>1310</b> causes the spool <b>1310</b> to be rotated in a first direction as the knob <b>1302</b> is grasped and rotated in the first direction by a user. Rotation of the spool <b>1310</b> in the first direction results in a lace (not shown) being wound around an annular channel <b>1312</b> or central post of the spool <b>1310</b>, which results in tensioning of the lace.</p>
<p id="p-0130" num="0129">When the knob is positioned in the axially raised position, the axially extending teeth <b>1304</b> of the knob <b>1302</b> disengage with the corresponding axially extending teeth <b>1313</b> of the spool <b>1310</b>, which allows the spool <b>1310</b> to rotate in a second direction opposite the first direction. Rotation of the spool <b>1310</b> in the second direction results in the lace being unwound from the annular channel <b>1312</b> of the spool, which results in the loosening or releasing of the tension in the lace. In the above manner, a user may tension the lace upon rotation of the knob <b>1302</b> in the first direction with the knob <b>1302</b> positioned in the axially lowered position, and may release tension on the lace by pulling axially upward on the knob <b>1302</b> to disengage the teeth of the knob <b>1302</b> and spool <b>1310</b>. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>18</b>B</figref>, the spool <b>1310</b> also includes alignment indicia <b>1317</b>, which aids in alignment of the spool <b>1310</b> and housing for attachment or coupling of the lace with the spool.</p>
<p id="p-0131" num="0130">Referring again to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>16</b>A and <b>16</b>B</figref>, the bayonet <b>1330</b> includes a recessed portion <b>1336</b> within which a lateral flange <b>1326</b> of the housing <b>1320</b> is positioned. The lateral flange <b>1326</b> may include a recessed portion or groove <b>1329</b> as described below. The bayonet <b>1330</b> also includes an axially extending tab <b>1334</b> that is configured to releasably couple with a radial protrusion <b>1321</b> of the housing <b>1320</b>. Specifically, with the lateral flange <b>1326</b> positioned within the recessed portion <b>1336</b> of the bayonet <b>1330</b>, the housing <b>1320</b> may be rotated downward relative to the bayonet <b>1330</b> so that the radial protrusion <b>1321</b> contacts or engages with the tab <b>1334</b> of the bayonet <b>1330</b>. A front surface of the radial protrusion <b>1321</b> may be angled or tapered so that contact or engagement between the radial protrusion <b>1321</b> and tab <b>1334</b> causes the tab <b>1334</b> to deflect slightly radially outward as the housing <b>1320</b> is pressed or rotated into engagement with the bayonet <b>1330</b>. The tab <b>1334</b> may deflect radially outward until an engagement lip (not shown) of the tab is positioned axially above a top surface of the radial protrusion <b>1321</b>. The tab <b>1334</b> may then return to an un-deflected position with the engagement lip positioned above the radial protrusion, which locks the housing <b>1320</b> in place about the bayonet <b>1330</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0132" num="0131">The housing <b>1320</b> may be uncoupled from the bayonet in an opposite manner. Specifically, the tab <b>1334</b> of the bayonet may be deflected radially outward, using a flathead screwdriver or other tool, and the housing <b>1320</b> may be pulled axially upward and out of engagement with the bayonet <b>1330</b>. Removal of the housing <b>1320</b> causes the spool <b>1310</b> and knob <b>1302</b> to likewise be uncoupled or detached from the bayonet <b>1330</b>. Accordingly, the bayonet <b>1330</b> enables the housing <b>1320</b> and other closure system components to be releasably coupled with the article. The bayonet may include indicia <b>1338</b> that identifies the release tab <b>1334</b> to a user.</p>
<p id="p-0133" num="0132">The housing <b>1320</b> includes lace entrance ports <b>1322</b> (also described herein as first and third apertures) within which the lace is inserted to access the spool <b>1310</b>. Positioned roughly opposite the lace entrance ports <b>1322</b> is an exit port (also described herein as a second aperture) that functions to enable easy attachment of the lace with the spool as describe herein. A bottom surface of the housing <b>1320</b> includes indicia <b>1327</b>, such as an arrow, that may be aligned with the indicia <b>1317</b> of the spool <b>1310</b> to indicate a proper alignment between the spool <b>1310</b> and housing <b>1320</b> for attachment of the lace. Stated differently, a user may align the indicia <b>1317</b> (e.g., arrow) of the spool <b>1310</b> with the indicia <b>1327</b> (e.g., arrow) of the housing <b>1320</b> to properly align the spool <b>1310</b> within the housing <b>1320</b> for attachment of the lace.</p>
<p id="p-0134" num="0133">Referring now to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>19</b></figref>, illustrated is a cross section view of the spool <b>1310</b> taken along line B-B. The cross sectional view of the spool <b>1310</b> illustrates that the spool <b>1310</b> includes a first lumen or channel <b>1316</b> and a second lumen or channel <b>1314</b>. The first and second channels, <b>1316</b> and <b>1314</b>, are connected at a midsection <b>1319</b> so that a single lumen or channel extends entirely through the spool <b>1310</b>. The midsection <b>1319</b> may be an aperture or channel that connects the first and second channels, <b>1316</b> and <b>1314</b>. In some embodiments, the first and/or second channels, <b>1316</b> and <b>1314</b>, may be tapered so that a diameter of the respective channels decreases as the channels extend inward into the body of the spool <b>1310</b>. The first and second channels, <b>1316</b> and <b>1314</b>, are radially offset from the central axis of the spool <b>1310</b> so that the channels are alignable with the entrance and exits ports, <b>1322</b> and <b>1324</b>, of the housing <b>1320</b> as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>20</b>A and <b>20</b>B</figref>. The first and second channels, <b>1316</b> and <b>1314</b>, may also be angled to some degree relative to the spool <b>1310</b>, and/or to one another, to further align the channels with the housing's entrance and exit ports, <b>1322</b> and <b>1324</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0135" num="0134">Although <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>19</b></figref> illustrates only one side of the spool <b>1310</b>, in many embodiments the opposite side of the spool <b>1310</b> includes similar lumens or channels. The lumen or channel configurations on the opposite sides of the spool <b>1310</b> enable multiple laces to be quickly and conveniently attached to the spool <b>1310</b> as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>20</b>B</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0136" num="0135">Referring now to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>20</b>A and <b>20</b>B</figref>, illustrated is a cross section view of the housing <b>1320</b> and spool <b>1310</b> taken along reference lines A-A. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>20</b>A</figref> illustrates the spool <b>1310</b> being aligned with the housing <b>1320</b> (e.g., via alignment of indicia <b>1317</b> and <b>1327</b>). <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>20</b>A</figref> also illustrates the spool <b>1310</b> having first and second channels, <b>1316</b> and <b>114</b>, positioned on opposite sides of the spool <b>1310</b>. As illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>20</b>A</figref>, an axis of the entrance ports <b>1322</b> is angled from, misaligned, or otherwise not parallel with an axis of the exit port <b>1324</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0137" num="0136">In the aligned state, the first channel <b>1316</b> of the spool <b>1310</b> aligns with the entrance port <b>1322</b> of the housing <b>1320</b> while the spool's second channel <b>1314</b> aligns with the housing's exit port <b>1324</b>. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>20</b>A</figref> illustrates that the first and second channels, <b>1316</b> and <b>1314</b>, are angled slightly relative to the spool <b>1310</b>, and radially offset from the center of the spool, to better align the channels with the housing's entrance and exit ports, <b>1322</b> and <b>1324</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0138" num="0137">As illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>20</b>B</figref>, alignment of the spool's first and second channels, <b>1316</b> and <b>1314</b>, with the housing's entrance and exit ports, <b>1322</b> and <b>1324</b>, allows a lace <b>1360</b> to be inserted within the housing's entrance port <b>1322</b>, pushed fully through the spool's first and second channels (<b>1316</b> and <b>1314</b>), and exit the housing <b>1320</b> via the exit port <b>1324</b>. The spool's first and second channels (<b>1316</b> and <b>1314</b>) are configured to guide or direct the distal end of the lace <b>1360</b> fully through the spool and out the exit port <b>1324</b> as the lace is inserted through the housing <b>1320</b> and spool <b>1310</b>. A knot <b>1362</b> may then be tied in the distal end of the lace <b>1360</b>, or a crimp component (not shown) coupled with the distal end of the lace <b>1360</b>. The lace <b>1360</b> may then be pulled back through the second channel <b>1314</b> of the spool <b>1310</b> and into engagement with an engagement portion <b>1318</b> of the spool's midsection <b>1319</b>. The engagement portion <b>1318</b> may be a notch, pocket, recess, or cut out portion of the spool's midsection <b>1319</b>. The engagement portion <b>1318</b> may have an opening smaller than the knot <b>1362</b> to prevent the knot <b>1362</b> from being pulled through the spool's midsection <b>1319</b>. In other embodiments, the tapered configuration of the second channel <b>1314</b> may be configured so as to engage with the knot <b>1362</b> and prevent the knot <b>1362</b> from being pulled entirely through the second channel <b>1314</b>. In yet other embodiments, the knot <b>1362</b> may engage with a combination of the engagement portion <b>1318</b> and the tapered second channel <b>1314</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0139" num="0138">Engagement of the knot <b>1362</b> with the engagement portion <b>1318</b> and/or second channel <b>1314</b> attaches the lace <b>1360</b> to the spool <b>1310</b>, which couples the lace <b>1360</b> with the knob <b>1302</b> via operational engagement between the knob <b>1302</b> and spool <b>1310</b>. As such, operation of the knob <b>1302</b> effects tensioning of the lace <b>1360</b> via winding of the lace around the spool's annular channel <b>1312</b>. To replace the lace <b>1360</b>, a user may easily decouple the housing <b>1320</b> from the bayonet <b>1330</b> as described above, align the spool <b>1310</b> with the housing <b>1320</b>, insert the lace <b>1360</b> through the housing <b>1320</b> and spool <b>1310</b>, tie a knot <b>1362</b> in the lace <b>1360</b>, and pull the lace into engagement with the engagement portion <b>1318</b> and/or second channel <b>1314</b>. The housing <b>1320</b> may then be reattached or coupled with the bayonet <b>1330</b>. The above described lace attachment process does not involve a significant disassembly of the closure system's components. Rather, a user merely needs to remove the housing <b>1320</b> from the bayonet <b>1330</b> in order to reattach or replace the lace <b>1360</b>. As such, far less time and energy is required to replace or reattach the lace in comparison to conventional systems.</p>
<p id="p-0140" num="0139">Detachment of the housing <b>1320</b> from the bayonet <b>1330</b> may only be necessary to ensure a proper alignment of the spool <b>1310</b> with housing <b>1320</b> since the indicia of the spool and housing are located on the bottom surfaces of the respective components. As illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>21</b>A and <b>21</b>B</figref>, in other embodiments the spool <b>1310</b> and housing <b>1320</b> may include indicia on other surfaces so that alignment of the spool <b>1310</b> and housing <b>1320</b> may be apparent or visible without detachment of the housing <b>1320</b> from the bayonet <b>1330</b>. For example, as illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>21</b>A</figref>, the spool <b>1310</b> may include indicia <b>1372</b> positioned on a bottom flange (or elsewhere) and the housing <b>1320</b> may include a window <b>1370</b> that allows a portion of the spool <b>1310</b> to be visible from outside the housing <b>1320</b>. The window <b>1370</b> may include a transparent material or a cut out or removed portion of the housing <b>1320</b>. As illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>21</b>B</figref>, a user may rotate the spool <b>1310</b> within the housing <b>1320</b> until the indicia <b>1372</b> (e.g., a color coded band or portion and the like) is visible through the window <b>1370</b> of the housing <b>1320</b>. Visibility of the indicia <b>1372</b> through the window <b>1370</b> indicates a proper alignment of the spool <b>1310</b> and housing <b>1320</b> for attachment of the lace <b>1360</b> as described above.</p>
<p id="p-0141" num="0140">In this embodiment, the housing <b>1320</b> does not need to be decoupled or detached from the bayonet <b>1330</b> to ensure that the spool <b>1310</b> is properly aligned with the housing <b>1320</b>. Because the housing <b>1320</b> and bayonet <b>1330</b> may remain coupled together, minor issues with attaching the lace may be prevented. For example, in some instances in which the housing <b>1320</b> is removed from the bayonet <b>1330</b>, it may be possible to cross the ends of the lace <b>1360</b> so that each lace end is inserted within the wrong entrance port <b>1322</b> of the housing <b>1320</b>, which results in the lace <b>1360</b> being crisscrossed upon reattachment of the housing <b>1320</b> with the bayonet <b>1330</b>. This potential problem is eliminated if the housing <b>1320</b> remains coupled to the bayonet <b>1330</b> since it is visibly evident how the lace <b>1360</b> and housing <b>1320</b> will be arranged prior to insertion of the lace <b>1360</b> within the housing's entrance ports <b>1322</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0142" num="0141">Referring now to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>22</b></figref>, illustrated is a method of tying a knot <b>1362</b> in the distal end of the lace <b>1360</b>. In step 1, the lace <b>1360</b> is pulled from the exit portion <b>1324</b> of the housing <b>1320</b>. In step 2, a distal tip <b>1364</b> of the lace <b>1360</b> is wrapped around the distal end portion of the lace <b>1360</b> to form a loop in the distal end of the lace <b>1360</b>. In step 3, the distal tip <b>1364</b> is gripped with the end <b>1382</b> of pliers <b>1380</b> (e.g., needle nose pliers). The distal tip <b>1364</b> may be gripped with the end <b>1382</b> of the pliers <b>1380</b> so that the distal tip <b>1364</b> is flush with a side of the pliers <b>1380</b> or is disposed between the opposing sides of the pliers <b>1380</b>. In step 4, the lace <b>1360</b> is retracted or pulled so that the loop formed in the distal end of the lace <b>1360</b> slides toward, and eventually off, the end <b>1382</b> of the pliers <b>1380</b>. As the loop slides off the end <b>1382</b> of the pliers <b>1380</b>, a knot <b>1362</b> is formed in the lace <b>1360</b>. Additionally, since the lace's distal end <b>1364</b> is gripped in the end <b>1382</b> of the pliers <b>1380</b>, the formed knot <b>1364</b> is substantially close to the lace's distal end <b>1364</b>. A tapered end of the pliers <b>1380</b> may aid in sliding the loop off the plier's end <b>1382</b>. In some embodiments, the taper of the plier's end <b>1380</b> may be rather pronounced so that the loop easily and quickly slides of the plier's end <b>1382</b> as the lace <b>1360</b> is retracted or pulled. In step 5, the lace is pulled entirely off the end <b>1382</b> of the pliers <b>1380</b> and the formed knot <b>1362</b> is sufficiently tightened.</p>
<p id="p-0143" num="0142">A knot <b>1362</b> formed using the process of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>22</b></figref> ensures that the lace's distal end <b>1364</b> will be sufficiently close or adjacent to the knot <b>1362</b> to prevent any potential issues when the lace <b>1360</b> is attached to the spool <b>1310</b>. For example, if the lace's distal end <b>1364</b> extends too far from the knot <b>1362</b>, the distal end <b>1364</b> will protrude or extend out of the second channel <b>1314</b> and into the spool's annular channel <b>1312</b> when the lace <b>1360</b> is attached to the spool <b>1310</b>. In such instances, the lace's distal end <b>1364</b> may interfere with winding of the lace <b>1360</b> about the spool <b>1310</b>. The knot forming process of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>22</b></figref> ensures that the distal end <b>1364</b> of the lace <b>1360</b> is positioned and remains within the second channel <b>1314</b> of the spool <b>1310</b>, thereby eliminating any potential problems that may otherwise exist.</p>
<p id="p-0144" num="0143"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>23</b></figref> illustrates another embodiment of forming a knot <b>1362</b> in the end of the lace <b>1360</b>. In forming the knot <b>1362</b>, the groove or recessed portion <b>1329</b> of the flange <b>1326</b> is used to cinch or tightly secure the knot <b>1362</b>. Specifically, a knot <b>1362</b> is initially formed in the distal end of the lace <b>1360</b>. The knot <b>1362</b> is then positioned in the groove <b>1329</b> and on one side of the flange <b>1326</b>. The lace <b>1360</b> is pulled in an opposite direction so that the groove <b>1329</b> and side of the flange <b>1326</b> press against the knot <b>1362</b> causing the knot <b>1362</b> to contract and tightly cinch together. The distal tip of the knot may then trimmed off as desired. The knot <b>1362</b> may be initially formed using the process illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>22</b></figref> and/or by some other means, such as via a user's hand. The knot cinching process of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>23</b></figref> ensures that the formed knot <b>1362</b> is sufficiently tight so as to prevent further cinching and/or possibly unraveling of the knot <b>1362</b> within the second channel <b>1314</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0145" num="0144">In accordance with the above disclosure, in some embodiments a method of coupling a lace with a spool component of a reel assembly may include obtaining or providing a housing component having an interior region, a first aperture, and a second aperture, and a spool component having a central cylindrical member and a lumen that extends through the central cylindrical portion. The method may also include positioning the spool component within the interior region of the housing component so that the spool component is rotatable within the interior region. The method may further include rotating the spool component within the interior region of the housing component to align one end of the central cylindrical member's lumen with the first aperture (e.g., entrance port of the housing component) and to align an opposite end of the central cylindrical member's lumen with the second aperture (e.g., exit port of the housing component). The method may additionally include inserting a distal end of the lace through the first aperture, through the lumen, and through the second aperture so that the distal end and a proximal end of the lace are positioned exterior to the housing component.</p>
<p id="p-0146" num="0145">The method may additionally include tying a knot in the distal end of the lace and retracting the distal end of the lace through the second aperture of the housing component so that the knot in the distal end of the lace engages with the central cylindrical member's lumen to prevent the distal end of the lace from being retraced through the first aperture of the housing component and thereby uncoupling the lace from housing component and spool. In some embodiments, the lumen of the central cylindrical member may include a tapered region that engages with the knot in the distal end of the lace. In such embodiments, a narrow portion of the tapered region may include an engagement portion, such as a notch or pocket, within which the knot is positioned when the knot engages with the central cylindrical member's lumen to prevent the distal end of the lace from being retraced through the first aperture. In some embodiments, an axis of the first aperture is non-parallel to an axis of the second aperture, or is otherwise angled relative to an axis of the second aperture. In some embodiments, the housing component includes a knot securement member within which the knot is positionable so that tensioning of the lace causes the knot to cinch down on itself.</p>
