<heading id="h-0006" level="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION</heading>
<p id="p-0067" num="0066">Artificial nails, such as artificial nail extensions, can be used to extend and decorate natural nails. Conventional artificial nails can include &#x201c;press-on&#x201d; nails or artificial nails applied by manicure professionals. Press-on nails can include acrylic nails formed of acrylic polymer-based compositions. Professional manicure service can build artificial nails on the natural nail using acrylic polymer-based compositions or gel-based compositions, for example.</p>
<p id="p-0068" num="0067">To apply acrylic polymer-based artificial nails, a manicurist may clean the client's natural nails, cut the natural nails, trim the cuticles, buff the natural nails, apply a primer, apply a base coat, cure the base coat, apply the nail tip or full nail using an adhesive, apply another base coat to the nail tip or full artificial nail, cure the other base coat, apply a nail polish, cure the polish, and apply and cure a top coat. Artificial nails provided by professional manicures can look very realistic (e.g., like natural nails) at least because the layers of the artificial nail are built on top of the client's nail bed. However, professional manicures are expensive and time consuming and can take from 1.5 to 3 hours to complete. Further, professional manicures using, for example acrylic-based polish, can be easily chipped or scratched.</p>
<p id="p-0069" num="0068">Conventional press-on artificial nails are much quicker to apply than professional manicured artificial nails. Such press-on artificial nails use a sticky glue, such as a cyanoacrylate-based adhesive to adhere the press-on artificial nail to the natural nail. The conventional press-on nails can be arranged and adhered to the natural nail using adequate pressure. However, conventional press-on nails often do not look like real nails at least because the demarcation between the natural nail and artificial nail is visible and pronounced. Additionally, the conventional press-on nail poorly adheres to the natural nail and easily detaches (e.g., pops off) during normal wear. Further, different individual have unique and differently sized and shaped natural nails. Press-on nails are formed of hard and/or inelastic pre-shaped plastic materials that does not conform to the unique shapes of natural nails. As such, press-on nails neither adhere securely to natural nails nor look like natural nails when applied.</p>
<p id="p-0070" num="0069">Aspects of the disclosure address the above challenges as well as others by providing light-curable artificial nails that can be applied with the ease of press-on nails and appear natural like professional manicured artificial nails but with increased durability. In some embodiments, a light-curable artificial nail can have multiple sections (e.g., horizontal sections), where each section has one or more layers of similar material. The sections can be stacked on top of one another to form a light-curable artificial nail. At least one section of the light-curable artificial includes a light-curable composition, such as gel-based composition, that is semi-cured. The light-curable artificial nail made of semi-cured light-curable composition(s) can be elastic and/or flexible such that the light-curable artificial nail can bend, flex and/or stretch (e.g. be shaped) to conform to a unique shape of a natural nail, which improves the bond between the light-curable artificial nail and makes the light-curable artificial nail appear more natural than a press-on nail. Similar to a manicured nail that is built layer upon layer on an individual's natural nail and that conforms to the underlying natural nail, the light-curable artificial nail can be made of one or multiple-sections that include semi-cured light-curable composition(s). In some embodiments, the light-curable artificial nail may effectively serve as a pre-built manicured nail in semi-completed state (e.g., semi-cured). The light-curable artificial nail as applied to a natural nail can be similar in appearance to a professional manicure and have a similar strong bond to the natural nail but be applied with the ease of a press-on nail.</p>
<p id="p-0071" num="0070">In some embodiments, the adhesive section of the light-curable artificial nail can include a light-curable composition, such as a gel-based base coat, that is semi-cured and remains tacky and sticky in the semi-cured state. A user can arrange a light-curable artificial nail on the natural nail, apply pressure to the light-curable artificial nail (using a pressure member, such as a nail form), and cure the light-curable artificial nail concurrently with the application of pressure, and in particular cure the adhesive section of the light-curable artificial nail, to form a strong bond between the natural nail and light-curable artificial nail. As noted above, the light-curable artificial nail in a semi-cured state can be flexible and/or elastic and conform to the shape and curvature of the natural nail such that the light-curable artificial nail can be arranged on the natural nail in a manner that reduces or eliminates visible demarcations between the natural nail and the light-curable artificial nail and improves the adhesive bond between the natural nail and light-curable artificial nail.</p>
<p id="p-0072" num="0071">In some embodiments, multiple sections of the light-curable artificial nail can include light-curable compositions in a semi-cured state. For example, the adhesive section can include a light-curable composition and one or more of the polish section or top coat section can include the same or different light-curable composition (e.g., such as a gel-based nail polish or gel-based top coat section, respectively) in a semi-cured state.</p>
<p id="p-0073" num="0072">In some embodiments, one or more of the sections of the light-curable artificial nail can include a non-light-curable composition. For example, the adhesive section can include a light-curable composition and one or more of the polish section or top coat section can include a non-light-curable composition.</p>
<p id="p-0074" num="0073">In some embodiments, a section of the light-curable artificial nail can include strengthening material that can help provide strength and/or structure to the light-curable artificial nail. For example, a section of the light-curable artificial nail can include a fiberglass material disposed between other sections of the light-curable artificial nail.</p>
<p id="p-0075" num="0074">In some embodiments, &#x201c;light-curable&#x201d; can refer to a substance (e.g., a composition) that can be chemically changed to form stronger and/or harder bonds upon exposure to specific wavelengths of electromagnetic radiation (e.g., light, such as ultra-violet (UV) light). For example, in some embodiments a light-curable composition can be cured by a polymerization process where the composition's molecules react by linking up with one another into large chains of polymers upon exposure to one or more wavelengths of light. Crosslinks, or chemical bonds, that connect different polymer chains together, also may be created, forming a structurally strong molecular network.</p>
<p id="p-0076" num="0075">In some embodiments, a light-curable composition can include a gel composition. In some embodiments, a gel composition can be a composition that can be semi-solid in an uncured state. In some embodiments, the gel composition in an uncured or semi-cured state can include one or more oligomers. In some embodiments, the light-curable composition can be cured using UV electromagnetic radiation (or specific wavelengths of UV electromagnetic radiation).</p>
<p id="p-0077" num="0076">In some embodiments, the term &#x201c;semi-cured state&#x201d; (e.g., partially cured) refers to a light-curable composition (or the light-curable composition(s) of the light-curable artificial nail, generally) that has been cured (e.g., by exposure to electromagnetic radiation) for less than an amount of time to fully cure the light-curable composition. In a semi-cured state, exposure to additional amounts (e.g., power and/or time) of specified wavelength(s) of electromagnetic radiation can cause the light-curable composition to further chemically change to form stronger and/or harder bonds. In some embodiments, the term &#x201c;semi-cured state&#x201d; refers to a light-curable composition (or light-curable artificial nail, generally) that is at least one of elastic, semi-solid, malleable, formable, clay-like, stretchable or combinations thereof and/or may have a Shore A (Durometer) hardness of less than about 90.</p>
<p id="p-0078" num="0077">The term &#x201c;cured state&#x201d; refers to a light-curable composition (or light-curable composition(s) of a light-curable artificial nail, generally) that is hard, durable and resistant to breaking and/or has a Rockwell hardness of about 1 gram(s) per cubic centimeter (g/cc) to about 110 g/cc, and/or a Shore D hardness of about 10 to about 100. In a cured state, exposure to additional amounts (e.g., power and/or time) of specified wavelength(s) of electromagnetic radiation does not cause or does not appreciably cause the light-curable composition to further chemically change to form stronger and/or harder bonds. For example, in the cured state, the polymerization process can be substantially complete. In some embodiments, a light-curable artificial nail (e.g., the light-curable composition(s) therein) in a cured state is harder, more durable, and/or more resistant to breaking than a light-curable artificial nail in a semi-cured state (or uncured state).</p>

<p id="p-0131" num="0130">In some embodiments, the light-curable composition includes a photoinitiator. Photoinitiators can be light sensitive chemicals that decompose into free radicals, which begins a polymerization process. For example, photonitiators may absorb one or more wavelength of light (e.g., UV light, LED light, etc.) and convert it into energy needed to drive the polymerization process (i.e., curing). The specific combination and type of photoinitiators used can impact the properties of the resulting gel. For example, the more photoinitiator there is in a composition, the faster the composition cures. Nonetheless, if the amount of photoinitiator is too high, the photoinitiator can cause excessive exotherms that heat up the composition when applied to a client's nails. This is especially uncomfortable for a client whose nails have been damaged by excessive filing, drilling or harsh abrasives. In some embodiments, the adhesive section <b>118</b>, the polish section <b>122</b> and the top coat section <b>126</b> (i.e., the gel coat) each contains a different amount and/or type of photoinitiator(s). For example, the top coat section <b>126</b> may include a larger amount of photoinitiator than the polish section <b>122</b> and the adhesive section <b>118</b>. Similarly, the polish section <b>122</b> may include a larger amount of photoinitiator than the adhesive section <b>118</b>, but less than the top coat section <b>126</b>. The adhesive section <b>118</b> may contain the lowest amount of photoinitiator because it is the closest composition to the natural nail and excessive heating may be uncomfortable to a client. In some embodiments, the photoinitiator of one or more of the adhesive section <b>118</b>, polish section <b>122</b> or top coat section <b>126</b> starts the polymerization process under UV light.</p>

In some embodiments, the operations can be performed in parallel. In some embodiments, the same, different, greater, or fewer operations can be performed. In some embodiments, the operations can be performed in the same or different order.</p>
<p id="p-0174" num="0173"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>6</b>A</figref> illustrates a method of preparing light-curable artificial nails, in accordance with some embodiments.</p>
<p id="p-0175" num="0174">According to some embodiments, operation <b>605</b> of method <b>600</b> provides a mold having a recess. The recess can include a shape that at least in part corresponds to the shape of a natural nail. In some embodiments, the recess can be any desired shape and corresponds to the shape of the light-curable artificial nail.</p>
<p id="p-0176" num="0175">At operation <b>610</b>, the equipment disposes a light-curable composition in the recess of a mold. In some embodiments, the light-curable composition is disposed in a non-cured state. In some embodiments, disposing the light-curable composition includes an injection molding operation that injects the gel-composition into a mold. In other embodiments, the disposing the light-curable composition includes supplying the gel-composition near or in the recess of the mold and using a flat surface, such an edge of squeegee blade to move an amount of the light-curable composition in the recess, if applicable, and remove excess light-curable composition from the recess of the mold.</p>
<p id="p-0177" num="0176">In some embodiments, one or more of a coating(s), a decoration(s), colorant(s) or other material may be placed in the recess before or after adding the light-curable composition and/or may be placed on top of the light-curable composition received in the recess. For example, if the shape of the recess is in the shape of a nail, a decoration in the form of a cuticle may be placed on top of the light-curable composition at the base of the nail. In another example, rhinestones, glitter or other decorative materials may be placed on the light-curable composition or pushed into the light-curable composition.</p>
<p id="p-0178" num="0177">At operation <b>615</b>, the equipment cures the light-curable composition from an uncured state to a semi-cured state. The light-curable composition is cured to form at least part of a body of the light-curable artificial nail. For example, the light-curable composition while in the mold may be exposed to one or more wavelengths of electromagnetic radiation for a time period sufficient to cure the material from a non-cured state to a semi-cured state. In some embodiments, the time period may be about 5 sec to about 15 min, or about 30 sec to about 10 min, or about 60 sec to about 5 min, or about 5 sec to about 5 min to form the semi-cured state. In the semi-cured state, the light-curable artificial nail may be elastic, semi-solid, formable, clay-like and/or stretchable to facilitate conformance of a shape of the light-curable artificial nail to the shape of the natural nail. The light-curable composition is configured to transition from the semi-cured state to a cured state upon exposure to one or more wavelengths of electromagnetic radiation. In some embodiments where multiple sections or layers are used to form the light-curable artificial nail, the operations can be repeated for one or more of the multiple sections and/or layers, as described below.</p>

<p id="p-0198" num="0197">Method <b>700</b> can include operation <b>705</b> that removes the light-curable artificial nail in semi-cured state from a removable layer. In some embodiments, the light-curable artificial nail can have an adhesive section that is disposed on at least part of the bottom surface of the light-curable artificial nail.</p>
<p id="p-0199" num="0198">Operation <b>710</b> includes arranging the light-curable artificial nail in the semi-cured state onto a natural nail. As noted herein, the light-curable artificial nail in the semi-cured state is elastic and/or bendable to facilitate conformance of the light-curable nail to the shape of the natural nail. Arranging the light-curable artificial nail onto the natural nail may include one or more of orientating, stretching, pushing, pulling, moving, lengthening or otherwise shaping the light-curable artificial nail to (e.g., completely) cover the natural nail and to form a desired shape.</p>
<p id="p-0200" num="0199">For example, the user can arrange a side of (the semi-cured) light-curable artificial nail to align proximate to (e.g., approximately flush with) one of the lateral nail folds that runs adjacent to the natural nail and adhere the light-curable artificial nail to part of the natural nail. The user can then bend and/or stretch the light-curable artificial nail so that it covers the entirety of the natural nail and that so that the opposite side of the light-curable artificial nail aligns proximate to the opposite lateral nail fold of the natural nail. As such, a particular light-curable artificial nail can conform to different shapes and/or angles of different natural nails.</p>
<p id="p-0201" num="0200">Once a user is satisfied with the shape of the semi-cured light-curable artificial nail as arranged onto the nail, the method <b>700</b> at operation <b>715</b> includes curing the semi-cured light-curable composition using one or more predetermined wavelengths of electromagnetic radiation.
