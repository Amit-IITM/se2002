<heading id="h-0006" level="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0013" num="0011">The present invention relates to a method for manufacturing a butyrate product comprising fermentation of a carbon source-containing feedstock with a Clostridia class bacterium which natively produces butyric acid, and further processing of the fermentation product to produce the butyrate product.</p>
<p id="p-0014" num="0012">The further processing results in an improved butyrate product as compared to that obtained by the fermentation process alone.</p>
<p id="p-0015" num="0013">The improved butyrate product may be a purified butyrate product and/or a butyrate product in solid form (such as a butyrate salt, which may be, for example, a salt of calcium or sodium) which are advantageous for use in a feed ingredient. Butyrate salts of calcium and sodium have been found to be preferable to butyrate salts of ammonium as feed ingredients.</p>
<p id="p-0016" num="0014">The improved butyrate product may have a low phosphorus content, wherein the method comprises removal of phosphorus from the clarified fermentation broth. Such low-phosphorus products are advantageous for use as an anti-icing agent. Furthermore, it has been found that potassium salts of acetate or butyrate have better anti-icing effects that those obtained by a corresponding ammonium salt.</p>
<p id="p-0017" num="0015">The improved butyrate product may be obtained by a lower cost process as compared to processes known in the art for obtaining such products. The reduced cost may be due to reusing ammonia liberated upon conversion of ammonium butyrate into the butyrate product and/or from the use of less refined carbon sources that include impurities such as phosphorus anions, as well as due to the use of processing coproducts such as calcium phosphate as a feed ingredient and as a fertilizer.</p>
<p id="p-0018" num="0016">The further processing step may comprise, for example, separating the butyrate product from co-products of fermentation, such as by distilling the butyrate product from the fermentation broth, distilling or vaporizing a co-product of fermentation from the fermentation broth, or forming an insoluble salt of a phosphorus anion, such as phytate or phosphate, which are found as impurities in prior art methods of fermentation and removing the insoluble salt from the fermentation broth.</p>
<p id="p-0019" num="0017">The particulars shown herein are by way of example and for purposes of illustrative discussion of the various embodiments of the present invention only and are presented in the cause of providing what is believed to be the most useful and readily understood description of the principles and conceptual aspects of the invention. In this regard, no attempt is made to show details of the invention in more detail than is necessary for a fundamental understanding of the invention, the description making apparent to those skilled in the art how the several forms of the invention may be embodied in practice.</p>
<p id="p-0020" num="0018">The present invention will now be described by reference to more detailed embodiments. This invention may, however, be embodied in different forms and should not be construed as limited to the embodiments set forth herein. Rather, these embodiments are provided so that this disclosure will be thorough and complete, and will fully convey the scope of the invention to those skilled in the art.</p>
<p id="p-0021" num="0019">Unless otherwise defined, all technical and scientific terms used herein have the same meaning as commonly understood by one of ordinary skill in the art to which this invention belongs. The terminology used in the description of the invention herein is for describing particular embodiments only and is not intended to be limiting of the invention.</p>
<p id="p-0022" num="0020">As used herein, the term &#x201c;butyrate product&#x201d; refers to a compound containing or derived from butyrate such as a butyrate salt, butyric acid, butyrate ester and the like.</p>

At the very least, and not as an attempt to limit the application of the doctrine of equivalents to the scope of the claims, each numerical parameter should be construed in light of the number of significant digits and ordinary rounding approaches.</p>
<p id="p-0032" num="0030">Notwithstanding that the numerical ranges and parameters setting forth the broad scope of the invention are approximations, the numerical values set forth in the specific examples are reported as precisely as possible. Any numerical value, however, inherently contains certain errors necessarily resulting from the standard deviation found in their respective testing measurements. Every numerical range given throughout this specification will include every narrower numerical range that falls within such broader numerical range, as if such narrower numerical ranges were all expressly written herein. Additional advantages of the invention will be set forth in part in the description which follows, and in part will be obvious from the description, or may be learned by practice of the invention. It is to be understood that both the foregoing general description and the following detailed description are exemplary and explanatory only and are not restrictive of the invention, as claimed. As used herein, when a numerical value is preceded by the term &#x201c;about&#x201d;, the term &#x201c;about&#x201d; is intended to indicate +/&#x2212;10% of that value.</p>

Corn mash was diluted and filtered to a concentration of 60-160 g/L assumed glucose, and an amylase enzyme was added during the fermentation. Only trace elements (Table 2) and vitamins (Table 3) were added to the fermentation.

Samples of the concentrated clarified broth were treated by pH adjustment with NaOH solution to reach pH 8 or 9. At pH 9, a strong ammonia smell was felt. To some of the samples a calcium acetate solution was added. Then, the samples were centrifugation and supernatant was analyzed. Clarified broth samples were of 50 gram. The concentration of calcium acetate in the added solutions was 20% wt. The results are summarized in Table 5.
