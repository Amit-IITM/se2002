<description id="description">
<?summary-of-invention description="Summary of Invention" end="lead"?>
<p id="p-0002" num="0001">The present invention relates in its broadest aspect to a compound of Formula I as provided herein, formulations comprising such a compound and corresponding uses thereof for the reduction of infestation with ectoparasites, in particular with insects, preferably with mosquitoes. Also provided herein are methods for preparing the formulations of the invention and methods for controlling ectoparasites using the compounds and/or formulations provided herein.</p>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">The infestation of animals or humans with parasites is highly undesirable. Humans or animals, for example, horses, dogs and cats all can serve as hosts for a large number of internal and external parasites. The presence of parasites can lead to discomfort, impaired health and performance, and even death. Each year, for example, millions of dogs and cats in the United States are treated for fleas, ticks, and mites. Flea, tick, and mite infestations cause great discomfort, transmit disease to pets and humans.</p>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">Mosquitoes are important as disease carriers. They transmit, for example, malaria, parasitic worms (filariasis), viruses (e.g. yellow fever, dengue fever, West Nile fever, chikungunya fever, Rift Valley fever) or bacteria (tularemia). Diseases that can be transmitted from mosquitoes to animals include Venezuelan equine encephalomyelitis, myxomatosis or rabbit plague, or the worms <i>Dirofilaria repens </i>and <i>Dirofilaria immitis</i>, which parasitize domestic dogs.</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">Mosquitoes can also significantly affect the quality of life of humans and animals if they appear in large numbers, since it is no longer possible to stay outdoors. This can lead to economic damage in the tourism sector or in livestock farming.</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">Several classes of insecticides are effective for combating parasites. For example, pyrethroids, organophosphates, organocarbarnates, and phenylpyrazoles are used to treat animals for parasite infestation. The newly discovered isoxazoline class was recently launched for ectoparasite control in dogs and cats. Various methods of formulating anti-parasitic agents are known in the art. These formulations include oral treatments, dietary supplements, powders, sprays, topical treatments (e.g., dips and pour ons), and shampoos. While each of these formulations has some efficacy in combating parasites, the formulations generally include synthetic insecticides or repellents. Synthetic insecticides have been known to cause environmental effects that are harmful to humans and animals. Similarly, Pyrethrin, although extracted from the <i>Chrysanthemum </i>flower, is hard to process and standardize.</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">Natural insecticides, i.e., insecticides that include natural plant essential oils as an active ingredient, have been known to kill household parasites such as ants, cockroaches, and fleas by applying the natural insecticide in the form of a spray, powder, or liquid to a locus or area to be protected from the parasites, as disclosed in U.S. Pat. Nos. 5,439,690, 5,693,344, 6,114,384, and 6,531,163.</p>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">Natural compounds or extracts have also been described in the art, e.g. by Jufri et al. (2016) International Journal of PharmTech Research 9, No. 7, pp. 140-145.</p>
<p id="p-0009" num="0008">Further, tobacco (<i>Nicotiana </i>genus spp.) leaves, powder, extracts or fumigants have been used for centuries to control agricultural pests or parasites of medical and veterinary importance. However, because of safety concerns regarding tobacco's major alkaloid nicotine and the discovery of more specific and potent synthetic pesticides, no nicotine-based products are currently commercially available. Synthetic neonicotinoids are structurally related to nicotine and widely used as agricultural and veterinary pesticides; however, unlike tobacco-related alkaloids, synthetic neonicotinoids have a higher selectivity for the insect nicotinic acetylcholine receptor (nAChR) and reduced binding to vertebrate nicotinic receptors. Their unique physicochemical features (photostability, non-volatility and hydrophilicity) explain their success as pesticides, but also their excessive use that lead to an extensive contamination of the environment. Neonicotinoids have now become a major concern for the survival of ecosystems. The proven impact on pollinators, aquatic and soil communities, and a more problematic toxicity profile than once perceived, pushes forward initiatives to limit or totally ban their use in agriculture, and move away from the worldwide use of synthetic pesticides.</p>
<p id="p-0010" num="0009">In view of the concerns associated with the use of tobacco's major alkaloid nicotine or the structurally related synthetic neonicotinoids, a need still exists for more effective compounds and compositions for use in controlling ectoparasites on humans and/or animals that have better safety profile than nicotine or the synthetic neonicotinoids due to differentiated mode of action and offer a more environmentally friendly solution. Many known insecticide classes are not fully protective, in particular those acting systemicly, such as the isooxazolines, and do not prevent ecptoparasites from biting, increasing the risk of vector borne disease transmission. Therefore, it is desirable to provide new compounds and formulations which are in particular active as a repellent for ectoparasites. Accordingly, rather than killing the ectoparasites, such compounds can keep ectoparasites away from areas or subjects to be protected.</p>
<p id="p-0011" num="0010">The solution to the above technical problem is characterized in the herein provided embodiments and claims.</p>
<p id="p-0012" num="0011">Accordingly, the invention relates to, inter alia, the following embodiments:

Whenever the term &#x201c;optional&#x201d;, &#x201c;optionally&#x201d; or &#x201c;may&#x201d; is used, the present invention specifically relates to both possibilities, i.e., that the corresponding feature is present or, alternatively, that the corresponding feature is absent. For example, the expression &#x201c;X is optionally substituted with Y&#x201d; (or &#x201c;X may be substituted with Y&#x201d;) means that X is either substituted with Y or is unsubstituted. Likewise, if a component of a composition is indicated to be &#x201c;optional&#x201d;, the invention specifically relates to both possibilities, i.e., that the corresponding component is present (contained in the composition) or that the corresponding component is absent from the composition.</p>
<p id="p-0046" num="0212">Various groups are referred to as being &#x201c;optionally substituted&#x201d; in this specification. Generally, these groups may carry one or more substituents, such as, e.g., one, two, three or four substituents. It will be understood that the maximum number of substituents is limited by the number of attachment sites available on the substituted moiety. Unless defined otherwise, the &#x201c;optionally substituted&#x201d; groups referred to in this specification carry preferably not more than two substituents and may, in particular, carry only one substituent. Moreover, unless defined otherwise, it is preferred that the optional substituents are absent, i.e. that the corresponding groups are unsubstituted.</p>

Unless defined otherwise, &#x201c;cycloheteroalkyl&#x201d; preferably refers to a 3 to 11 membered saturated ring group, which is a monocyclic ring or a fused ring system (e.g., a fused ring system composed of two fused rings), wherein said ring group contains one or more (e.g., one, two, three, or four) ring heteroatoms independently selected from O, S and N, wherein one or more S ring atoms (if present) and/or one or more N ring atoms (if present) are optionally oxidized, and wherein one or more carbon ring atoms are optionally oxidized; more preferably, &#x201c;cycloheteroalkyl&#x201d; refers to a 5 to 8 membered saturated monocyclic ring group containing one or more (e.g., one, two, or three) ring heteroatoms independently selected from O, S and N, wherein one or more S ring atoms (if present) and/or one or more N ring atoms (if present) are optionally oxidized, and wherein one or more carbon ring atoms are optionally oxidized.</p>
<p id="p-0058" num="0224">As used herein, the term &#x201c;are taken together&#x201d; means that two groups are combined to represent a single group. It is to be understood that this single group will be a divalent group. Accordingly, the term &#x201c;R<sup>3 </sup>and R<sup>5 </sup>are taken together to form group Z&#x201d; preferably indicates that R<sup>3 </sup>and R<sup>5 </sup>are (theoretically) linked to form a divalent group (&#x2014;R<sup>3</sup>-R<sup>5</sup>&#x2014;), wherein the (theoretical) divalent group (&#x2014;R<sup>3</sup>-R<sup>5</sup>&#x2014;) is then replaced by Z. In other words, the divalent group Z binds with one bond to the carbon to which R<sup>3 </sup>was attached and with the other bond to the carbon to which R<sup>5 </sup>was attached.</p>

<p id="p-0103" num="0269">As known by the skilled person in the art, the ratio of compounds differing only in chirality, such as in the case of R and S, can be determined in a number of ways known in the art, including but not limited to chromatography using a chiral support, polarimetric measurement of the rotation of polarized light, nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy using chiral shift reagents, or derivatization of a compound using a chiral compound such as Mosher's acid followed by chromatography or nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy. Enantiomers can further be isolated from mixtures by methods known to those skilled in the art, including chiral high-pressure liquid chromatography (HPLC) and direct fractional crystallization of the racemate, i.e., by chiral co-crystallization techniques, which exploit the formation of specific hydrogen bonding interactions present in co-crystals (see Springuel G R, et al., 2012; and U.S. Pat. No. 6,570,036). Useful co-crystallization partners include enantiomers of mandelic acid, malic acid, tartaric acid and its derivatives; or enantiomers can be prepared by asymmetric syntheses. See, for example, Eliel and Wilen, 1994.</p>
<p id="p-0104" num="0270">The ratio of R and S (which may also be referred to as the chiral purity) of the inventive composition can also be expressed in terms of its enantiomeric excess (ee), typically and preferably as determined by chiral HPLC, and calculated by the equation:</p>

Examples of solvents that form solvates include, but are not limited to, water, isopropanol, ethanol, methanol, dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO), ethyl acetate, acetic acid, and ethanolamine. The term &#x201c;hydrate&#x201d; refers to the complex where the solvent molecule is water.</p>
<p id="p-0109" num="0274">A &#x201c;co-crystal&#x201d; refers to a crystalline structure that contains at least two different compounds that are solid in their pure form under ambient conditions. The at least two different compounds may include R and/or S and/or any further components of the composition or formulation provided herein. Co-crystals are made from neutral molecular species, and all species remain neutral after crystallization; further, typically and preferably, they are crystalline homogeneous phase materials where two or more building compounds are present in a defined stoichiometric ratio. See hereto Wang Y and Chen A, 2013; and Springuel G R, et al., 2012; and U.S. Pat. No. 6,570,036. It is to be understood that the R and S may be in the form of any polymorph. A variety of co-crystals and techniques for preparing such co-crystals are described in RSC Drug Discovery, Pharmaceutical Salts and Co-crystals, published in 2012 by the Royal Society of Chemistry and edited by Johan Wouters and Luc Qu&#xe9;r&#xe9;, in particular in chapters 15 and 16.

<p id="p-0110" num="0275">The compound or formulation of the invention is also provided for use in the control of insects and/or arachnids that are parasites, particularly for use in the control of insects and/or arachnids that are of ectoparasites, particularly for the reduction of infestation with the same. Accordingly, the present invention, inter alia, relates to the use of the compound or formulation provided herein for reducing infestation with ectoparasites, in particular ectoparasites from the phylum arthropoda, more particularly an ectoparasite from the insect class, including fleas and mosquitoes and/or from the arachnid class, particularly mites, including ticks, etc., but preferably for reducing infestation with mosquitoes.</p>
<p id="p-0111" num="0276">In the context of the present invention, insects may be in particular mosquitoes. In particular, the term mosquitoes in understood to include members of the family Culicidae, including the subfamilies Anophelinae and Culicinae. However, within the invention the term &#x201c;insects&#x201d; includes insects of the order: Lepidoptera, Coleoptera, Homoptera, Heteroptera, Diptera, Thysanoptera, Orthoptera, Anoplura, Siphonaptera, Mallophaga, Thysanura, Isoptera, Psocoptera and Hymenoptera. However, the invention relates in particular to those which trouble humans or animals and carry pathogens, for example flies such as <i>Musca domestica, Musca vetustissima, Musca autumnalis, Fannia canicularis, Sarcophaga carnaria, Lucilia cuprina, Hypoderma bovis, Hypoderma lineatum, Chrysomyia chloropyga, Dermatobia hominis, Cochliomyia hominivorax, Gasterophilus intestinalis, Oestrus ovis, Stomoxys calcitrans, Haematobia irritans </i>and <i>Nematocera</i>, such as mosquitoes (Culicidae), including the genera <i>Aedes, Anopheles, Culex</i>, and <i>Ochlerotatus</i>, midges (Ceratopogonidae, Simuliidae, and Psychodidae), including the <i>Phlebotoma </i>and <i>Lutzomyia </i>genera, for example fleas (Siphonaptera), such as <i>Ctenocephalides felis </i>and <i>Ctenocephalides canis </i>(cat and dog fleas), <i>Xenopsylla cheopis, Pulex irritans, Dermatophilus penetrans</i>, blood-sucking lice (Anoplura), such as <i>Hematopinus </i>spp, <i>Solenopotes </i>spp, <i>Linognathus </i>spp, <i>Pediculus humanis</i>, chewing-lice (mallophaga), such as <i>Bovicola </i>(<i>Damalina</i>) <i>ovis </i>and <i>Bovicola bovis</i>, biting flies and horse-flies (Tabanidae), <i>Haematopota </i>spp. such as <i>Haematopota pluvialis</i>, Tabanidae spp. such as <i>Tabanus nigrovittatus</i>, Chrysopsinae spp. such as <i>Chrysops caecutiens</i>, tsetse flies, such as species of <i>Glossinia</i>, nuisance insects, particularly cockroaches, such as <i>Blatella germanica, Blatta orientalis</i>, and <i>Periplaneta americana. </i></p>
<p id="p-0112" num="0277">In the context of the present invention, ectoparasites of the arachnid class may be in particular ectoparasites of the order Acarina, including mites and ticks. Representatives of mites are, for example, <i>Dermanyssus gallinae, Sarcoptes scabiei, Psoroptes ovis </i>and <i>Psorergates </i>spp. Known representatives of ticks are, for example, <i>Boophilus, Amblyomma, Anocentor, Dermacentor, Haemaphysalis, Hyalomma, Ixodes, Rhipicentor, Margaropus, Rhipicephalus, Argas, Otobius </i>and <i>Ornithodoros </i>and the like, which preferably infest warm-blooded animals including farm animals, such as cattle, horses, pigs, sheep and goats, poultry such as chickens, turkeys and geese, fur-bearing animals such as mink, foxes, chinchillas, rabbits and the like, as well as companion animals such as cats and dogs, but also humans.</p>
<p id="p-0113" num="0278">Ticks may be divided into hard and soft ticks. Hard ticks are characterised by infesting one, two or three host animals. They attach themselves to a passing host animal and suck the blood or body fluids. Fully engorged female ticks drop from the host animal and lay large amounts of eggs (2000 to 3000) in a suitable crack in the floor or in any other protected site where the larvae hatch. These in turn seek a host animal, in order to suck blood from it. Larvae of ticks which only infest one host animal moult twice and thus become nymphs and finally adult ticks without leaving the host they have selected. Larvae of ticks which infest two or three host animals leave the animal after feeding on the blood, moult in the local environment and seek a second or third host as nymphs or as adult ticks, in order to suck its blood.</p>
<p id="p-0114" num="0279">Ticks are responsible world-wide for the transmission and spread of many human and animal diseases. Because of their economic influence, the most important tick genera are <i>Boophilus, Rhipicephalus, Ixodes, Hyalomma, Amblyomma </i>and <i>Dermacentor</i>. They are carriers of viral, bacterial (including <i>Rickettsia </i>and <i>Spyrochetes</i>) and protozoal diseases and cause tick-paralysis and tick-toxicosis. Even a single tick can cause paralysis whereby its saliva penetrates into the host animal during ingestion. Diseases caused by ticks are usually transmitted by ticks, which infest several host animals. Such diseases, for example anaplasmosis, ehrlichiosis, babesiosis, theileriosis and heart water disease, are responsible for the death or impairment of a large number of domestic and farm animals in the entire world. In many countries of temperate climate, ticks of the genus <i>Ixodes </i>transmit the agent of the chronically harmful Lyme's disease from wild animals to humans. Apart from the transmission of disease, the ticks are responsible for great economic losses in livestock production. Losses are not confined to the death of the host animals, but also include damage to the pelts, loss of growth, a reduction in milk production and reduced value of the meat. Although the harmful effects of a tick infestation on animals have been known for years, and enormous progress has been made using tick-control programmes, until now no completely satisfactory methods of controlling or eliminating these parasites have been found, and in addition, ticks have often developed resistance to chemical active ingredients.</p>
<p id="p-0115" num="0280">The infestation of fleas on domestic animals and pets likewise still represents for the owner a problem which has not been satisfactorily resolved or can only be resolved at considerable expense. As with ticks, fleas are not only troublesome, but are carriers of disease. For example, to be mentioned here is Flea Atopic dermatitis (FAD), a serious skin disease in dogs, which is difficult to treat. Fleas can transmit various fungal diseases from host animal to host animal and to the animal keeper, particularly in moist, warm climatic areas, for example in the Mediterranean, in the southern part of USA, etc. Those at risk in particular are people with a weakened immune system or children whose immune system has not yet fully developed. Owing to their complex life cycle, none of the known methods for the control of fleas is completely satisfactory, especially as most known methods are basically directed towards the control of adult fleas in the pelt, and leave completely untouched the different juvenile stages of the fleas, which exist not only in the pelt of the animal, but also on the floor, in carpets, in the bedding of the animal, on chairs, in the garden and all other places with which the infested animal comes into contact. Flea treatment can be expensive and has to be continued over long periods of time.</p>
<p id="p-0116" num="0281">Besides being a real nuisance in many parts of the world, mosquitoes are the most important and deadly vectors of human and animal diseases: viruses (i.e. Zika, dengue, chikungunya, West Nile, yellow fever), protozoans (malaria plasmodium), and filarial nematodes (dog heartworm, human lymphatic filariasis). Avoiding mosquito bites by treating human, animals, households with insecticides or repellents is therefore the best method for the prevention of mosquito borne diseases. Extensive programs for the control of mosquito populations have been put in place that are nowadays less efficient due to the wide spreading of resistance to current insecticides among mosquito populations.</p>
<p id="p-0117" num="0282">Mosquitoes are known to function as vectors, or transmitters, of infectious disease in both animals and humans.</p>
<p id="p-0118" num="0283">Disease organisms transmitted by mosquitoes include, for example, West Nile virus, Saint Louis encephalitis virus, Eastern equine encephalomyelitis virus, Everglades virus, Highlands J virus, La Crosse Encephalitis virus in the United States; dengue fever, yellow fever, Ilheus virus, malaria, Zika virus and filariasis in the American tropics; Rift Valley fever, <i>Wuchereria bancrofti</i>, Japanese encephalitis, chikungunya and filariasis in Africa and Asia; and Murray Valley encephalitis in Australia.</p>
<p id="p-0119" num="0284">Depending on the situation, source reduction, biocontrol, larviciding (killing of larvae), or adulticiding (killing of adults) may be used to manage mosquito populations. These techniques are accomplished using habitat modification, pesticide, biological-control agents, and trapping.</p>
<p id="p-0120" num="0285">Success usually depends on treating not only the infested animal, e.g. the human, dog, cat, cattle, horse, but at the same time all the locations which the infested animal frequents.</p>
<p id="p-0121" num="0286">Such a complicated procedure is unnecessary with the present compounds of formula (I), since a particular advantage of the compounds of formula I under discussion is that they are extremely effective and at the same time of very low toxicity for the warm-blooded animals.</p>
<p id="p-0122" num="0287">The compounds of formula (I) according to the present invention may be mixed with other substances having the same sphere of activity or with parasiticides or with other activity-improving substances to achieve further improved or longer-lasting action, and then applied.</p>
<p id="p-0123" num="0288">Since the active ingredients are in many instances applied to warm-blooded animals and of course come into contact with the skin, suitable formulation excipients are the excipients and administration forms that are known in cosmetics. They may be administered in the form of solutions, emulsions, ointments, creams, pastes, powders, sprays, etc.</p>
<p id="p-0124" num="0289">The compounds of formula (I) according to the present invention may be formulated for application to the animal by any technique suitable for topical administration, including a spraying, dipping, or a pour-on technique. Further preferred application techniques include slow release devices, such as bracelet, collars or ear tags (for cattle) aiming at providing long lasting protection against ectoparasites.</p>
<p id="p-0125" num="0290">The compounds of formula (I) according to the present invention is preferably applied externally to the skin of the animal using an applicator device, such as a gun, spray, or the animal is submerged in a bath of the dip formulation.</p>
<p id="p-0126" num="0291">In particular, suitable formulations may be applied in a liquid form or an aerosol form. The aerosol form may use a liquid or a gas as a propellant. These include, for example, conventional propellant gases required for spray cans, such as propane, butane, dimethyl ether, CO<sub>2</sub>, or halogenated lower alkyl gases (for example, halogenated C<sub>1</sub>-C<sub>4 </sub>alkyls), and mixtures of two or more thereof.</p>
<p id="p-0127" num="0292">In particular, the compounds of formula (I) according to the present invention is formulated such that they can be sprayed directly in an area of infestation or they can be bound to a solid support or encapsulated in a time release material.</p>
<p id="p-0128" num="0293">The solid support may be provided in form of collars, which are designed to combat common external parasites on companion animals. These collars typically consist of a matrix, usually of a matrix of a plastics material containing between 5 and 40% of an active substance and allow a release of the active ingredient over an extended time. These collars therefore ensure a long-lasting protection against ectoparasites.</p>
<p id="p-0129" num="0294">For administration to farm animals or pets, such as cows, horses, asses, camels, dogs, cats, poultry, sheep, goats, etc., the so-called &#x2018;pour-on&#x2019; or &#x2018;spot-on&#x2019; formulations are also suitable; these liquid or semi-liquid formulations have the advantage that they only have to be applied to a small area of the pelt or plumage, and, thanks to the proportion of spreading oils or other spreading additives, they disperse by themselves over the whole pelt or plumage, without having to do anything else, and become active over the whole area.</p>
<p id="p-0130" num="0295">Of course, inanimate materials, for example clothing or dog and cat baskets, stables, carpets, curtains, living quarters, conservatories, etc. may be treated with said formulations and thus protected from parasite infestation.</p>
<p id="p-0131" num="0296">For application on humans, a pleasant-smelling essence, e.g. a perfume, can be added to make application more attractive.</p>
<p id="p-0132" num="0297">In a preferred embodiment of the present invention, the compound of the invention or the formulation of the invention is applied in the form of a topical formulation.</p>
<p id="p-0133" num="0298">Thus, in accordance with the present invention, a formulation is provided comprising a compound of Formula I.</p>
<p id="p-0134" num="0299">In certain embodiments the compound of Formula I may be placed in liposomes. In accordance with the present invention, any phospholipid and/or phospholipid derivative such as a lysophospholipid may be utilized to form a liposome for encapsulating the compound of Formula I. Suitable phospholipids and/or phospholipid derivatives include, but are not limited to, lecithin, lysolecithin, phosphatidylcholine, phosphatidylethanolamine, phosphatidylinositol, phosphatidylglycerol, phosphatidic acid, phosphatidylserine, lysophosphatidylcholine, lysophosphatidylethanolamine, lysophosphatidylglycerol, lysophosphatidic acid, lysophosphatidylserine, PEG-phosphatidylethanolamine, PVP-phosphatidylethanolamine, combinations thereof, and the like.</p>
<p id="p-0135" num="0300">In some embodiments, a lecithin derived from egg or soybean may be utilized as the phospholipid. Such lecithins include those commercially available as PHOSPHOLIPON&#xae; 85G, PHOSPHOLIPON&#xae; 90G, and PHOSPHOLIPON&#xae; 90H (the fully hydrogenated version of PHOSPHOLIPON&#xae; 90G) from American Lecithin Company, Oxford, Conn. Other suitable lecithins include LECINOL S-10@ lecithin from Nikko Chemicals.</p>
<p id="p-0136" num="0301">The above phospholipids or derivatives thereof may be utilized to form liposomes containing the compound of Formula I or alternative formulations comprising Formula I. In embodiments, a lecithin having a high phosphatidylcholine content may be utilized to form a liposome. In some embodiments a high phosphatidylcholine lecithin which may be utilized includes PHOSPHOLIPON&#xae; 85G, a soy-derived lecithin containing a minimum of about 85% of a linoleic acid based-phosphatidylcholine. This lecithin is easy to use and is able to produce submicron liposomes at low process temperatures (from about 20&#xb0; C. to about 55&#xb0; C.) without the addition of any other special additives. PHOSPHOLIPON&#xae; 85G contains, in addition to phosphatidylcholine, approximately 5-7% phosphatidic acid. The phosphatidic acid confers a negative surface charge to the resulting formulations, reduces processing time and process energy, and aids in the formation of stable forms.</p>
<p id="p-0137" num="0302">In some embodiments, additional components may be combined with the formulation to improve overall rheological and processing properties, and to insure microbiological integrity during storage. Such components include, without limitation, absorbents, antifoaming agents, acidifiers, alkalizers, buffers, antimicrobial agents, antioxidants (for example tocopherols, BHT, polyphenols, phytic acid) binders, biological additives, chelating agents (for example, disodium EDTA, tetrasodium EDTA, sodium metasilicate, and the like), denaturants, preservatives (for example imidazolidinyl urea, diazolidinyl urea, phenoxyethanol, methylparaben, ethylparaben, propylparaben, and the like), reducing agents, solubilizing agents, solvents, viscosity modifiers, humectants, thickening agents, and combinations thereof. These additional components may be present in an amount from about 0.001% by weight to about 10% by weight of the dispersion, in embodiments from about 0.1% by weight to about 1% by weight of the dispersion.</p>
<p id="p-0138" num="0303">Examples of suitable humectants which may be added to the formulation include, but are not limited to, polyols and polyol derivatives, including glycerol, diglycerol, triglycerol, ethylene glycol, propylene glycol, butylene glycol, pentylene glycol (sometimes referred to herein as 1,2-pentane diol), isopreneglycol (1,4-pentane diol), 1,5-pentane diol, hexylene glycol, erythritol, 1,2,6-hexanetriol, polyethylene glycols such as PEG-4, PEG-6, PEG-7, PEG-8, PEG-9, PEG-10, PEG-12, PEG-14, PEG-16, PEG-18, PEG-20, combinations thereof, sugars and sugar derivatives (including fructose, glucose, maltose, maltitol, mannitol, inositol, sorbitol, sorbityl silanediol, sucrose, trehalose, xylose, xylitol, glucuronic acid and salts thereof), ethoxylated sorbitol (Sorbeth-6, Sorbeth-20, Sorbeth-30, Sorbeth-40), and combinations thereof. In some embodiments, a commercially available 1,2-pentane diol such as HYDROLITE-5@ pentylene glycol (commercially available from Symrise GmbH) may be utilized.

Where utilized, such humectants may be present in amounts from about 0.1% by weight to about 20% by weight of the dispersion, in embodiments from about 3% by weight to about 10% by weight of the dispersion.</p>
<p id="p-0139" num="0304">In some embodiments, a preservative such as phenoxyethanol and a humectant such as butylene glycol, hexylene glycol, pentylene glycol and/or propylene glycol may both be added to the formulation. In embodiments, the pentylene glycold and/or propylene glycol may provide humectancy and assist in the preservation of the concentrate when combined with phenoxyethanol. The phenoxyethanol and pentylene glycol and/or propylene glycol mix should be water soluble and non-volatile.</p>
<p id="p-0140" num="0305">The compound of Formula I may be present in the resulting concentrate in an amount of from about 10% by weight of the concentrate to about 30% by weight of the concentrate, in embodiments from about 18% by weight of the concentrate to about 26% by weight of the concentrate, in some embodiments from about 21% by weight of the concentrate to about 22% by weight of the concentrate. The amount of phospholipids in the concentrate may be from about 1% by weight of the concentrate to about 20% by weight of the concentrate, in embodiments from about 4% by weight of the concentrate to about 12% by weight of the concentrate, with the balance being the solvent, humectant and preservative.</p>
<p id="p-0141" num="0306">The resulting formulation may be administered directly or, in embodiments, may be combined with any acceptable carrier. As used herein the terms &#x201c;acceptable carrier&#x201d; and &#x201c;acceptable carriers&#x201d; refers to those compounds which are suitable for use in contact with the tissues of the human or animal without undue toxicity, irritation, allergic response, and the like, commensurate with a reasonable benefit/risk ratio, and effective for their intended use, as well as salts and biocompatible derivatives of those compounds.

<p id="p-0142" num="0307">The use of such media and agents is within the purview of those skilled in the art. Supplementary active ingredients can also be incorporated into the compositions.</p>
<p id="p-0143" num="0308">In embodiments, the above carriers may be utilized alone or in combination to form a carrier system. Suitable carrier systems are within the purview of those skilled in the art and may include, but are not limited to, lotions, creams, gels, emulsions, dispersions, solids, solid sticks, semisolids, aerosol or non-aerosol foams, sprays, serums, transdermal adhesive patch systems, combinations thereof, and the like. In embodiments, the liposomes may be in a liposomal concentrate and may be introduced with a permeation enhancer as described above. In embodiments, the permeation enhancer may be present in a water phase added to the liposomal concentrate to form a composition of the present disclosure. In embodiments, the formulation may be used for transdermal delivery.</p>
<p id="p-0144" num="0309">The compound of Formula I may thus be present in the final composition, in embodiments a lotion, cream or any other suitable form described above, in amounts of from about 0.2% by weight to about 50%, preferably from about 5% by weight to about 50% by weight of the composition, in embodiments from about 10% by weight to about 50% by weight of the composition.</p>
<p id="p-0145" num="0310">For example, in some embodiments a lotion or cream may include an oil phase which, in turn, may include emollients, fatty alcohols, emulsifiers, combinations thereof, and the like. For example, an oil phase could include emollients such as C12-15 alkyl benzoates (commercially available as FINSOLV&#x2122; TN from Finetex Inc. (Edison, N.J.)), capric-caprylic triglycerides (commercially available from Huls as MIGLYOL&#x2122; 812), and the like. Other suitable emollients which may be utilized include vegetable derived oils (corn oil, safflower oil, olive oil, macadamian nut oil, etc.); various synthetic esters, including caprates, linoieates, dilinoleates, isostearates, fumarates, sebacates, lactates, citrates, stearates, palmitates, and the like; synthetic medium chain triglycerides, silicone oils or polymers; fatty alcohols such as cetyl alcohol, stearyl alcohol, cetearyl alcohol, lauryl alcohol, combinations thereof, and the like; and emulsifiers including glyceryl stearate, PEG-100 stearate, Glyceryl Stearate, Glyceryl Stearate SE, neutralized or partially neutralized fatty acids, including stearic, palmitic, oleic, and the like; vegetable oil extracts containing fatty acids, Ceteareth-20, Ceteth-20, PEG-150 Stearate, PEG-8 Laurate, PEG-8 Oleate, PEG-8 Stearate, PEG-20 Stearate, PEG-40 Stearate, PEG-150 Distearate, PEG-8 Distearate, combinations thereof, and the like; or other non-polar cosmetic or pharmaceutically acceptable materials used for skin emolliency within the purview of those skilled in the art, combinations thereof, and the like.</p>
<p id="p-0146" num="0311">The emollients, C<sub>12-15 </sub>alkyl benzoates, may be included for emolliency and spreadability. Where present, the emollient may be present in an amount from about 0.2% by weight to about 15% by weight of the total composition, in embodiments from about 2% by weight to about 6% by weight of the total composition. Alcohols such as cetyl alcohol and stearyl alcohol may be added to impart body or texture to a cream. Where both cetyl alcohol stearyl alcohol are utilized, the ratio of cetyl alcohol to stearyl alcohol may be from about 2:1 to about 1:2, with the waxy alcohols making up from about 1 to about 6 weight percent of the total composition, in embodiments from about 2% by weight to about 4% by weight of the total composition.</p>
<p id="p-0147" num="0312">As noted above, this oil phase may also include emulsifiers. Suitable emulsifiers include, but are not limited to, stearates including glyceryl stearate, PEG-100 stearate, glyceryl stearate SE, glyceryl stearate citrate, combinations thereof, and the like. In embodiments, a combination of stearates may be utilized in the oil phase as an emulsifier. For example, a glyceryl stearate and PEG-100 stearate mixture (in embodiments, a mixture of glyceryl stearate and polyethylene glycol 100 stearate commercially available as ARLACEL&#xae; 165 from ICI Americas) may be used as an emulsifier to form an oil-in-water (o/w) emulsion. In such a combination, the PEG-100 stearate may act as the primary emulsifier and the glyceryl stearate may be a co-emulsifier. The emulsifier may be present in an amount from about 2% by weight to about 8% by weight of the total composition, in embodiments from about 3% by weight to about 5% by weight of the total composition.</p>
<p id="p-0148" num="0313">The weight ratio of emulsifier to emollients as described above in this oil phase may be from about 10:1 to about 1:2, in some embodiments from about 2:1 to about 1:1.</p>
<p id="p-0149" num="0314">Where present, an oil phase may be present in an amount of from about 5% to about 20% by weight of a lotion or cream, in embodiments from about 8% to about 15% by weight of a lotion or cream. Lotions or creams formed with the above liposomes may also include a water phase, which may, in embodiments, include the permeation enhancer described above as well as those items combined to form the second phase described above, including humectants and preservatives. Thus, in embodiments, the water phase utilized in formation of a lotion or cream possessing liposomes as described herein may include the second phase described above. In addition, in embodiments it may be desirable to add a viscosity modifier, sometimes referred to herein as a viscosity agent, to provide the lotion and/or cream with a desired viscosity.</p>
<p id="p-0150" num="0315">Suitable viscosity agents which may be added to the water phase include water soluble polymers, including anionic polymers and nonionic polymers.

Combinations of the foregoing may also be used in embodiments. In some embodiments, a CARBOMER such as CARBOMER 940 may be added as a viscosity agent to control the rheological properties of the cream formulas and add stability to the primary emulsion.</p>
<p id="p-0151" num="0316">Where utilized, a viscosity agent may be present in an amount from about 0.1% to about 2% by weight of the composition, in embodiments from about 0.25% to about 0.6% of the composition.</p>

<p id="p-0182" num="0347">Results from other compounds of the present invention are shown in Table 1 and compared to DEET, and were similarly tested as follows:</p>
<p id="p-0183" num="0348">The compound of the invention is mixed with ethanol to make a composition that can be applied to a surface and allowed to dry. After the surface is treated with the compounds of the invention and dried, it is heated to human body temperature, and the number of landings and the total time spent by the mosquitoes on the warm surface by adult <i>Aedes aegypti </i>mosquitoes is recorded automatically by machine vision to measure repellency of each compound.</p>
<p id="p-0184" num="0349">Repellency (based on the number of individual landings on the warm surface) is expressed as a percentage reduction of the control, where the average number of mosquitoes landing on a warm surface treated only with the vehicle solvent is counted. 100% means no mosquitoes landed on the warm surface.</p>
<p id="p-0185" num="0350">For mosquitoes that still landed on the warm surface, the time spent on the warm surface is also recorded and expressed as a percentage of the control, corresponding to the average time that mosquitoes spent on the same warm surface when treated only with the vehicle solvent. 100% mean that the mosquitoes spent the same time on the treated warm surface as on a warm surface treated only with the vehicle solvent.</p>
<p id="p-0186" num="0351">Each compound/dose is tested in triplicates using an oil pre-coated glass surface of 132.7 cm and 360 microliters of solution without the compound (the placebo) or with the compound dilution spread on the surface, and allowed to dry before the test. The average and standard error on triplicates is calculated. The control (using only vehicle solvent) is run with ethanol/1% (w/w) dimethylsulfoxide. The same population of mosquitoes is exposed first to the warm surface treated with the vehicle solvent, then to the surface treated with the compound. The concentration of the solution comprising the test compound is adjusted to ensure the treatment dosage of the compound is according to the final concentration per surface unit area in the table.</p>

<heading id="h-0003" level="1">Example 2: Tick Repellency Assay and Acaricidal Activity of Anatabine Derivatives</heading>
<p id="p-0188" num="0352">The test for repellency of compounds to ticks relies on their questing behavior. Ticks will explore their habitat to find a suitable host hunting site and try to avoid areas treated with repellent or irritating substances. The compounds of the invention are dissolved in dimethylsulfoxide (DMSO) and then diluted with ethanol to make a composition containing a maximum of 1% (w/w) DMSO, which is suitable for achieving the stated concentration per unit area on the applied surface. The composition or control is applied to the treatment area and allowed to dry. A circular arena of 8.96 cm2 from which ticks cannot escape is used for the assay. Only one quadrant (2.25 cm2) is treated with the test compound or control, while the rest is left untreated. 30 to 60 <i>Rhipicephalus sanguineus </i>tick larvae are deposited in the non-treated area of the circular arena. After 1 minute, the change in position of the ticks in the treated and untreated areas is measured for a duration of 2 minutes. A visual recording device, such as a camera, records the test area, from which number of movements in the treated and untreated areas can be counted and reported as number of tick movements. If the compound shows repellent activity, ticks will avoid walking on the treated quadrant. Repellency is expressed as: 1&#x2212;M<sub>T</sub>/M<sub>U</sub>)&#xd7;100, where M<sub>T </sub>is the number of tick movements within the treated area, and M<sub>U </sub>is the number of tick movements within the untreated area. 100% means that all the ticks completely avoided the treated surface. The potential acaricidal activity of the test compounds is measured in the same setup over a duration of 8 minutes and the knockdown activity is expressed in % motility reduction between the beginning and the end of the 8 minutes.</p>

<p id="p-0194" num="0355">Diethyl (pyridin-3-ylmethylene)dicarbamate. p-Toluenesulfonic acid (5.00 g, 26.3 mmol) was added to a solution of ethyl carbamate (33.27 g, 373.4 mmol) and nicotinaldehyde (17.53 mL, 186.7 mmol) in benzene (400 mL). The solution was stirred at strong reflux with a Dean Stark apparatus (overnight). A precipitate formed during the reaction. The reaction mixture was cooled to 0&#xb0; C. and the material was filtrated. It was further washed twice with diethyl ether to afford a colorless solid (6.2 g, 88%).</p>

Boron trifluoride acetic acid complex (17.04 mL, 122.7 mmol) was added and the tube was sealed and heated at 80&#xb0; C. for 3 h. The mixture was then poured at 0&#xb0; C. into a sodium hydroxide solution (6M) to reach pH=14. The aqueous layer was then extracted with dichloromethane (3times).
