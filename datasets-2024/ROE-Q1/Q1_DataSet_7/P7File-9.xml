<p id="p-0002" num="0001">This application claims priority to Chinese Patent Application No. CN202220121009.8 filed on Jan. 17, 2022, and Chinese Patent Application No. CN202210052815.9 filed on Jan. 17, 2022, the entire contents of which are hereby incorporated by reference.</p>
<heading level="1" id="h-0002">FIELD OF INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">The present invention relates to an electronic smoking device, and finds particular application in connection with an electronic smoking device accommodating generic cigarettes and will be described with particular reference thereto. It is to be understood, however, that it also finds application in other usage scenarios, and is not necessarily limited to the aforementioned exemplary embodiment.</p>
<heading level="1" id="h-0003">BACKGROUND OF INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">Smoking is a proven hazard to both personal and public health. Smoking generates harmful substances such as tar, nitric oxide and carbon monoxide, some of them are cancer causing substances. While many people stop smoking as the result of long-time educational campaign to reduce the smoking population, for those who have difficulties to quit, low risk cigarettes have been developed to protect them by mitigating the harmful substances.</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">It has been recognized that most health hazard chemicals are produced at a high temperature (doi: 10.1183/20734735.ELF161) Physically, smoke is a stable aerosol composed of heterogeneous mixture of gases, vapors, liquid and particles. Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>, the temperature in the tip section <b>110</b> of a typical cigarette <b>100</b> can reach 900&#xb0; C., and the temperature drops to about 700&#xb0; C. in the next section <b>120</b>. Although the temperature continuously drops from 600&#xb0; C. to 200&#xb0; C. in a distillation zone <b>130</b>, hazard chemicals in the aerosol generated at the high temperature section <b>110</b> and <b>120</b> can be inhaled by smokers. For this reason, there have been attempts in recent decades to reduce aerosol generating temperature with heat-not-burn method, therefore the level of the harmful chemicals in the aerosol is reduced with tobacco consumption devices.</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">A number of aerosol-generating devices with a reduced temperature for cigarette smoking are known. For example, Philip Morris International developed heat-not-burn cigarettes under IQOS brand (US 11,191,300). The method of heat-not-burn is to heat tobacco material without setting it alight. At a temperature well below 900&#xb0; C., heat-not-burn can generate a flavorful nicotine-containing aerosol containing less harmful chemicals compared with a regular cigarette. However, IQOS smoking device consumes certain brands, which are specially designed cigarettes. Smokers cannot freely choose the cigarettes available on the market.</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">In order to provide smokers with an electronic aerosol generating device that is compatible with generic cigarettes on the consumer market, Shenzhen Yukan Technology Co. developed IUOC (US 2018/0289073) and Shenzhen Youme Group Co., Ltd. developed YOUME (US 10,786,009) for generic cigarettes to produce aerosol by means of heat-not-bum. However, with these devices, the entire cigarette including wrapping paper (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>, <b>150</b>) is heated, creating charcoal smell from the baked paper.</p>
<heading level="1" id="h-0004">SUMMARY OF INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">According to an aspect of the present disclosure, an electronic smoking device accommodating generic cigarettes without baking the wrapping paper of the cigarette is provided. The electronic smoking device comprises a cylindrical cigarette receiver; an extractor for retrieving smoking substances from a cigarette; a heating unit including at least one heating element for baking the retrieved smoking substances to generate a desired aerosol; an air tight aerosol accumulation cavity with a first opening coupled to the cigarette receiver and a second opening coupled to the heating unit; an electronic control circuit board and a power supply.</p>

A generic cigarette includes a filter <b>140</b> which is typically located at one end of the cigarette as a mouthpiece.</p>
<p id="p-0024" num="0023"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref> illustrates a cross section view of an electronic smoking device <b>200</b> according to one of the embodiments of the present disclosure. The smoking device comprises a cylindrical cigarette receiver <b>210</b>, an extractor <b>220</b> for retrieving smoking substances from a cigarette, a heating unit <b>230</b> including at least one heating element for baking the retrieved smoking substances to generate a desired aerosol, an air tight aerosol accumulation cavity <b>240</b> having a first opening <b>244</b> air tightly coupled with the cigarette receiver and a second opening <b>246</b> air tightly coupled with the heating unit <b>230</b>, an electronic control circuit board <b>250</b> and a power supply <b>260</b>. The term &#x201c;air tight aerosol accumulation cavity&#x201d;, as used here, refers to a cavity or an enclosure that is air tight and capable to contain aerosol without substantial leak when its openings are all sealed.</p>
<p id="p-0025" num="0024">With continued reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref>, when a generic cigarette <b>100</b> is inserted in the cigarette receiver <b>210</b>, the extractor <b>220</b> extracts smoking substances <b>160</b>, leaving the wrapping paper <b>150</b> behind intact. The retrieved smoking substance is transferred into the heating unit <b>230</b> via the air tight aerosol accumulation cavity <b>240</b>. The smoking substance <b>160</b> in the heating unit is baked at a low temperature (&lt; 300&#xb0; C.), generating smoking aerosol which is collected in the air tight aerosol accumulation cavity. A user draws on the mouthpiece with filter <b>140</b>. Since the aerosol is generated from a low temperature by baking smoking substances only, without heating the cigarette wrapping paper <b>150</b>, the aerosol maintains original flavors of the smoking substances.</p>
<p id="p-0026" num="0025"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b>A</figref> and <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b>B</figref> illustrate an electronic smoking device <b>300</b> according to one of the embodiments of the present disclosure. The smoking device <b>300</b> comprises an extractor with an elongated portion <b>320</b> attached to a driver <b>325</b>. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b>A</figref>, a substantial portion of the elongated portion <b>320</b> is inside of the cigarette receiver. The elongated portion is engaged by the driver <b>325</b> to perform a motion pattern to agitate and to extract the smoking substance <b>160</b> from a cigarette. In one embodiment, the driver <b>325</b> is an electrical motor. The motion pattern for the elongated portion can be rotation around or longitudinal motion along the main axis. The motion pattern can be also vibration, wobbling, or combination of all above. Once a cigarette is inserted all the way into the receiver and the smoking substance <b>160</b> is fully extracted out of the cigarette and loaded into heating unit <b>330</b>, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b>B</figref>. A user draws on the mouthpiece with filter <b>140</b> to inhale the aerosol collected in the air tight aerosol accumulation cavity. The empty cigarette with the wrapping paper <b>150</b> and filter <b>140</b> is disposable.</p>
<p id="p-0027" num="0026">With continued reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>3</b>A and <b>3</b>B</figref>, an air tight aerosol accumulation cavity <b>340</b> has a first opening <b>344</b> and second opening <b>346</b>. The cigarette receiver <b>210</b> is air tightly coupled with the first opening which has a slope. The angle between the slope and the main axis of the receiver is larger than 135&#xb0; to facilitate transferring the retrieved smoking substance from the cigarette to the heating unit via the air tight aerosol accumulation cavity. The second opening <b>346</b> is air tightly coupled to the heating unit. Since the heat-not-burn smoking means requires a low baking temperature to reduce the level of harmful chemicals, the aerosol generating rate is generally low. Therefore it is necessary to have an air tightly coupling between the first opening of the air tight aerosol accumulation cavity <b>340</b> and the cigarette receiver, as well as an air tightly coupling between the second opening of the cavity <b>340</b> and the heating unit to ensure an optimum collection of the aerosol for a user to inhale. In addition, the air tight aerosol accumulation cavity <b>340</b> may include certain mechanical and/or electrical feed through structures, and these structures are required to be air tight. For example, the driver <b>325</b> is coupled to the elongated portion <b>320</b> of the extractor via an air tight mechanical feed through <b>370</b> of the aerosol accumulation cavity <b>340</b>. The term &#x201c;air tight aerosol accumulation cavity&#x201d; is defined above. The air tight aerosol accumulation cavity <b>340</b> or <b>240</b> can be constructed as one piece without seam, or the cavity can be made by integrating several pieces together with air tight seals.</p>
