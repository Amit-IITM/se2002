<p id="p-0003" num="0002">The present disclosure provides, in part, hydrogen-generating compositions and methods of using the same for dietary supplementation and soil fertilization.</p>
<heading id="h-0003" level="1">BACKGROUND</heading>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">Over the past two decades hydrogen utilization for therapy in animals and agricultural application has gained attention. Current mixtures for generating hydrogen focus on using metallic magnesium, for example, where metallic magnesium has been used to produce negative oxidation reduction potential for use in various mixtures. However, magnesium powder can spontaneously ignite on contact with air and generate massive amounts of heat, and thus the mixtures are particularly dangerous due to their propensity to combust and produce burns. Metallic magnesium by itself is a hazardous substance. The manufacture of products with Mg metal powder into pharmaceutical forms, such as sachets, pills, tablets, or capsules is a hazardous undertaking because manipulation of the powder is dangerous. Correspondingly, manufacturing plants avoid working with metallic magnesium particles.</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">The current mixtures for generation of hydrogen using metallic magnesium have the potential of causing serious burns and stomach problems due to their exothermic reaction and/or ignition. To feasibly implement hydrogen-generating products for use in health and agriculture, there remains a need to 1) generate appreciable amounts of hydrogen gas, 2) in a controlled manner that does not result in heat or fire, such that 3) the bioavailability of the hydrogen is enhanced.</p>

<p id="p-0055" num="0054">In aspects, the present disclosure provides compositions comprising powder form metallic magnesium and CaMg(CO<sub>3</sub>)<sub>2 </sub>capable of forming molecular hydrogen in the presence of an acid and/or water. CaMg(CO<sub>3</sub>)<sub>2</sub>, in embodiments, is referred to as &#x2018;dolomite,&#x2019; which is a form of limestone, rich in approximately equal parts of magnesium carbonate and calcium carbonate. Dolomite, in embodiments, is used as a substitute for &#x201c;generally regarded as safe&#x201d; (GRAS) sources of calcium and magnesium salts.</p>
<p id="p-0056" num="0055">Compositions herein, in embodiments, involve the mixing of magnesium particles with a non-combustive substance (CaMg(CO<sub>3</sub>)<sub>2</sub>) to resolve the problem of hazardous combustion involving metallic magnesium compositions, such as those described in U.S. Patent Publication No. 2015/0258136 and U.S. Patent Publication No. 2019/0166885, both of which are hereby incorporated by reference in their entirety. Compositions comprising metallic magnesium and magnesium carbonate (MgCO<sub>3</sub>) or calcium carbonate (CaCO<sub>3</sub>) or their combination has been considered in U.S. Pat. No. 9,144,581 to produce negative oxidation reduction potential in a food mixture. Dolomite, in embodiments, is a composition comprising CaMg(CO<sub>3</sub>)<sub>2</sub>. In embodiments, there is a functional and compositional difference between a combination of CaCO<sub>3 </sub>and MgCO<sub>3</sub>, which is a mixture of two independent salts, and dolomite which is a composition of CaMg(CO<sub>3</sub>)<sub>2</sub>&#x2014;a distinct molecule which comprises an arrangement of two molecules, CaCO<sub>3 </sub>and MgCO<sub>3</sub>. The resulting reaction involving dolomite, in embodiments, emits a constant, low-level stream of hydrogen gas that is safer and more effective. In embodiments, salts of carbonates, such as dolomite, CaMg(CO<sub>3</sub>)<sub>2</sub>, when heated, emit carbon dioxide CO<sub>2</sub>, which suppresses the reaction of heated magnesium metal with atmospheric oxygen. The compositions of CaMg(CO<sub>3</sub>)<sub>2</sub>, in embodiments, are suitable for dietary purposes in animal consumption.</p>
<p id="p-0057" num="0056">The powder form metallic magnesium and CaMg(CO<sub>3</sub>)<sub>2</sub>, in embodiments, are present in a mass ratio of 1:m, where m is greater than 5. In non-limiting embodiments, a mixture of dolomite powder with metallic magnesium powder in a mass ratio of m to 1, where m is 5, or more than 5, passes burn and combustion tests. For instance in non-limiting examples, when heated, dolomite emits carbon dioxide that suppresses any extraneous combustion of magnesium. In embodiments, the ratio of metallic magnesium to dolomite is about or at least about 1:5, about or at least about 1:5.5, about or at least about 1:6, about or at least about 1:6.5, about or at least about 1:7, about or at least about 1:7.5, about or at least about 1:8, about or at least about 1:9, about or at least about 1:10, about or at least about 1:12, about or at least about 1:14, about or at least about 1:16, about or at least about 1:18, about or at least about 1:20, about or at least about 1:30, about or at least about 1:40, about or at least about 1:50, or the ratio is about or at least about 1:100 or greater.

<p id="p-0092" num="0090">Hydrogen therapy uses molecular hydrogen for the treatment of various human diseases. Clinical research has revealed that hydrogen is an important physiological regulatory factor with antioxidant, anti-inflammatory, and anti-apoptotic protective effects on cells, for example as described in HUANG, et al., &#x201c;Recent advances in hydrogen research as a therapeutic medical gas,&#x201d; <i>Free Radial Research, </i>Vol. 44, No. 9, 2010: pp. 971-82; OHTA, et al., &#x201c;Recent progress toward hydrogen medicine: potential of molecular hydrogen for preventive and therapeutic applications,&#x201d; <i>Curr Pharm Des. </i>Vol. 17, No. 22, 2010: pp. 2241-52; NICOLSON, et al., &#x201c;Clinical Effects of Hydrogen Administration: From Animal and Human Diseases to Exercise Medicine,&#x201d; <i>Int J Clin Med, </i>Vol. 7, 2016: pp. 32-76; and MATEI, et al., &#x201c;Emerging mechanisms and novel applications of hydrogen gas therapy,&#x201d; <i>Med Gas Res, </i>Vol. 8, No. 3, 2018: pp. 98-102, each of which is hereby incorporated by reference in their entirety. Prominent effects of the H<sub>2 </sub>treatment have been documented in many oxidative stress-related diseases (HUANG, 2010; OHTA, 2010; NICOLSON, 2016; MATEI, 2018).</p>
<p id="p-0093" num="0091">Typically, methods of delivery of molecular hydrogen to a human or animal body include inhalation hydrogen, drinking hydrogen-enriched water (e.g., obtained either by electrolysis or dissolving hydrogen gas bubbles into water), and injection of hydrogen-saturated saline (HUANG, 2010). These methods, however, do not permit controllable hydrogen release because hydrogen equilibrium results in the hydrogen gas rapidly leaving water. Therefore, the amount of hydrogen delivered is unknown and is expected to be too small to exert any appreciable effect.</p>
<p id="p-0094" num="0092">Accordingly, provided herein in embodiments, are methods of dietary supplementation of molecular hydrogen including administering a composition including powder form metallic magnesium and CaMg(CO<sub>3</sub>)<sub>2 </sub>capable of forming molecular hydrogen in the presence of gastric acid, wherein the composition is administered prior to, concurrent with, or after consumption of food or beverage. In embodiments, the composition reacts to form molecular hydrogen gas in a controlled method in which hydrogen is obtained by chemical reaction of the components with a special substance or composition, for example and without limitation with acid or water. Methods of dietary supplementation herein, in embodiments, obtain hydrogen by chemical reaction of elements such as K, Na, Ca, Mg, Zn, Fe, B, Al, among others, with hydrochloric acid (the main acid of gastric juice) and/or water to generate hydrogen gas. In embodiments, these elements are present in the form of salts (e.g., CaMg(CO<sub>3</sub>)<sub>2</sub>) in compositions for dietary supplementation.</p>
<p id="p-0095" num="0093">Methods of dietary supplementation, in embodiments, include oral consumption of metallic magnesium powder and CaMg(CO<sub>3</sub>)<sub>2</sub>, among other ingredients (e.g., as detailed in Table 1) in tablet, capsule, pill, sachet, powder, stick, etc. that generates hydrogen in the medium of gastric juice or water, for example, prior to eating and/or drinking, during meal consumption, or after eating a meal. Alternatively, in embodiments, compositions are admixing with water or another suitable beverage followed subsequently by ingestion. In embodiments, compositions can be used as food additives, e.g., admixed with food for consumption.</p>
<p id="p-0096" num="0094">In embodiments, each dose of the composition vehicle (e.g., capsule(s)) produces at least 20 mL of H<sub>2 </sub>gas, which is sufficient to elicit the effects described herein. As referred to herein, in embodiments, the volume of H<sub>2</sub>, in milliliters (mL), is a volume of H<sub>2 </sub>at room temperature 20&#xb0; C. (68&#xb0; F.) and atmospheric pressure at sea level. In embodiments, under these conditions, for example, 10 mL of H<sub>2 </sub>corresponds to a mass of 0.83 mg of molecular hydrogen. Methods herein, in embodiments, include a total daily dose of H<sub>2 </sub>of at least about 6.6 mg (about 80 mL) of H<sub>2</sub>. In embodiments, the composition is formulated and/or administered such that at least 6.6 mg (about 80 mL) of H<sub>2 </sub>is generated in the subject's body over a period of about or at least about 4 hours, about or at least about 6 hours, about or at least about 8 hours, about or at least about 10 hours, or about or at least about 12 hours or more when the compound is administered to the subject at least one time over that period, at least two times over that period, at least three times over that period, or at least four times or more over that period.

<p id="p-0097" num="0095">Methods of dietary supplementation, in embodiments, include ingestion of compositions described herein to react with acids in the gastrointestinal tract to generate molecular hydrogen. The release of molecular hydrogen after consumption, in embodiments, forms hydrogen nanobubbles which penetrates into the stomach walls and reaches the bloodstream, for example as described in SAFONOV and KHITRIN, &#x201c;Hydrogen nanobubbles in a water solution of dietary supplement,&#x201d; <i>Colloids and Surfaces A: Physiochemistry Engineering Aspects, </i>Vol. 436, 2013: pp. 333-6, which is hereby incorporated by reference in its entirety.</p>
<p id="p-0098" num="0096">Methods of dietary supplementation, in embodiments, include administering one or more H<sub>2</sub>-generating solid forms that initiate a chemical reaction and/or release stored H<sub>2 </sub>upon contact with the hydrochloric acid (and/or other liquids) in the subject's gastrointestinal tract. Without wishing to be bound by theory, in embodiments, the H<sub>2 </sub>forms nanobubbles in the gastrointestinal tract, as described in SAFONOV and KHITRIN (2013), which facilitates H<sub>2 </sub>penetration into tissues and organs, thereby boosting the bioavailability and/or nutritional value of ingested nutrients. In embodiments, the ingested nutrients are either consumed separately or admixed with the hydrogen-generating composition, as described herein.</p>
<p id="p-0099" num="0097">Methods of dietary supplementation, in embodiments, include ingesting one or more pills, tablets, capsules, and the like, that generate at least 20 mL of H<sub>2 </sub>gas in the gastric juice of the gastrointestinal tract.</p>
<p id="p-0100" num="0098">In humans, nitrite accumulation can occur via the gastrointestinal tract (e.g., from consumption of certain foods such as fruit pits, almonds, and cooking of vegetables, such as cabbage, Brussels sprouts, and cauliflower), which can release nitriles through hydrolysis. Nitrite formation in the body is generally excreted via urine, although its buildup is acutely toxic, resulting in the formation of potential health conditions. Methods of dietary supplementation herein, in embodiments, decrease nitrite accumulation and/or absorption. Without wishing to be bound by theory, in embodiments, the compositions assist with neutralizing nitrites by inducing a reducing environment in close proximity to the gastrointestinal epithelia as nitrites accumulate so that they are more easily excreted from the body prior to exerting toxic effects.</p>
<p id="p-0101" num="0099">Methods of dietary supplementation described herein, in embodiments, increase resiliency to pathogens, for example and without limitation, as a prophylactic supplement for one or more gastrointestinal pathogens, such as bacteria (e.g., <i>E. coli, Salmonella, Shigella, Campylobacter, Clostridium</i>), viruses (e.g., Norovirus, Rotavirus, Coronavirus, Rhinovirus, Parainfluenza), and parasites (e.g., <i>Giardia, Entamoeba, Ascaris</i>). Without wishing to be bound by theory, in embodiments, ingestion of the hydrogen-generating compositions described herein induce a reducing environment near the stomach lining and/or intestinal epithelial which decreases the likelihood of infection by gastrointestinal pathogens.</p>

Compositions for soil conditioning and/or fertilization, in embodiments, are formulated to promote plant and/or seed growth in soil. The composition is formulated such that, in embodiments, the reaction of magnesium with water at low temperatures (e.g., 10&#xb0; C.-25&#xb0; C.) is relatively slow and the hydrogen released by the reaction will remain in the soil from about or at least about 1 hour to about or at least about 7 days or more, having a positive effect on plant growth.</p>
<p id="p-0117" num="0113">Compositions for soil conditioning and/or fertilization, in embodiments, are formulated to decrease nitrite accumulation in the soil.

<p id="p-0121" num="0116">Hydrogen biology can enable positive outcomes in agriculture. Agriculture faces significant challenges from growing populations, climate change, natural disasters, environmental pollution, and food safety issues. Hydrogen agriculture with hydrogen-rich water is a practical application of hydrogen biology, which could address many of these challenges.</p>
<p id="p-0122" num="0117">Typically, methods of delivery of molecular hydrogen to soil include hydrogen-enriched water, e.g., obtained either by electrolysis or dissolving hydrogen gas bubbles into water, or by pumping hydrogen gas into soil. These methods do not permit controllable hydrogen absorption because hydrogen equilibrium results in the hydrogen gas rapidly leaving the water, and hydrogen gas does not get captured by the soil. Therefore, the amount of hydrogen delivered is unknown and is expected to be too small to have any appreciable effect.</p>

The purpose of this experimentation was to demonstrate that the composition is safe for use and produces an appreciable amount of hydrogen gas.</p>
<heading id="h-0014" level="2">Readily Combustible Solid Analysis</heading>
<p id="p-0143" num="0137">This test was performed to identify the ability of the substance to propagate combustion for metal powders or powders of metal alloys and non-metallic pastes, powders, and granular substances. The test was divided into two parts 1) a Preliminary Screening to rule out substances that do not meet the criteria immediately, and 2) a Burn Rate Test. If the substance did not ignite and did not propagate combustion by either burning with flame or smoldering along 200 mm length of the powder train (i.e., a continuous line of powder) within the 20 minute test period, then the substance was not classified as a flammable solid and the Burn Rate Test was not performed.</p>
<p id="p-0144" num="0138">A sample of metallic magnesium powder and dolomite at a 1:7 mass ratio (DoH2) was poured into a rectangular mold and then inverted onto a cool impervious base plate to form an unbroken line of packed white powder at a height of 10 mm by a width of 20 mm by a length of 250 mm (e.g., as illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>). A gas burner was placed at one end of the sample and ignition was attempted for a maximum of 5 minutes for metal powders to determine the burn rate along a 200 mm distance of the sample train. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>, after a flame was applied for 5 minutes, the sample propagated approximately 19 mm with smoldering and sparks. At the end of the 20 minute test period no further propagation was observed. According to these data, the DoH2 sample was not classified as a flammable solid and the Burn Rate Test was not performed.</p>
<heading id="h-0015" level="2">Water Reactivity Analysis</heading>
<p id="p-0145" num="0139">This test was performed to identify materials that, when in contact with water, are liable to become spontaneously flammable or to give off gas at a rate of &#x3e;1 L/kg of material/hr. Based on the reactivity, the sample was classified into one of three groupings based on rate of gas evolution measured: 1) Packing Group I (at least 10 L/kg/min); 20 Packing Group II (at least 20 L/kg/hr), and 3) Packing Group III (at least 1 L/kg/hr).</p>
<p id="p-0146" num="0140">Twenty five (25) g. of the DoH2 sample was placed in 3 separate Erlenmeyer flasks that were then attached to vacuum apparatuses and combined with distilled water via a funnel to measure a volume of between 100 mL to 250 mL of gas evolution. Gas evolution was monitored every minute for one hour and then hourly for a minimum of 6 additional hours. Table 3 below summarizes the gas evolution in 3 independent trials. Trails were performed at 66.1&#xb0; F. (approx. 18.9&#xb0; C.) and 28.5% humidity.</p>

<p id="p-0149" num="0141">Table 4 above summarizes the calculations performed for deriving the gas evolution rates of the 3 trials. Testing on all samples was concluded after 9 hours because the rate of gas evolution was steady or declining.</p>
<p id="p-0150" num="0142">In conclusion, the material was observed to not be a Readily Combustible Solid because the sample did not propagate combustion across 200 mm in less than 20 minutes. According to the water reactivity data, the sample was classified as Packing Group III due to the observed gas evolution of 2.2 L/kg/hr in all three trials. The data demonstrated a slow reactivity with water that is not anticipated to produce damage to gastrointestinal tissue, especially at the dosage ranges described herein. Various mass ratios of metallic magnesium powder and dolomite were tested, such as 1:5 mass ratios, which were also observed to exhibit the same Readily Combustible Solid and water reactivity results. These data demonstrate that the combination generated an appreciable amount of gaseous hydrogen at reactivity rates that are considered safe for consumption.</p>
