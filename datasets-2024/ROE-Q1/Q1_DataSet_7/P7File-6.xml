<heading id="h-0007" level="1">DESCRIPTION OF EMBODIMENTS</heading>
<p id="p-0016" num="0015">Embodiments of the present invention will now be described in detail with reference to the drawings.</p>
<p id="p-0017" num="0016">&#x3c;Container&#x3e;</p>
<p id="p-0018" num="0017">As illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>, a container (<b>1</b>) includes a container body (<b>2</b>), a refrigeration apparatus (<b>10</b>), an air composition adjustment device (<b>50</b>) (controlled atmosphere (CA) system), and a ripening control device (<b>60</b>). The container (<b>1</b>) is used for marine transportation.</p>
<p id="p-0019" num="0018">The refrigeration apparatus (<b>10</b>) cools air in an internal space (S) of the container body (<b>2</b>) (target space). The air composition adjustment device (<b>50</b>) introduces air adjusted to a composition different from that of the outside air into the internal space (S). The ripening control device (<b>60</b>) controls the state of ripeness of plants (<b>15</b>) (objects) stored in the internal space (S).</p>
<p id="p-0020" num="0019">In the internal space of the container body (<b>2</b>), boxed plants (<b>15</b>) as fresh items are stored. Examples of the plants (<b>15</b>) include garden stuff, such as bananas and avocados, vegetables, cereals, bulbous plants, and natural flowers. The plants (<b>15</b>) breathe by absorbing oxygen (O<sub>2</sub>) in the air and releasing carbon dioxide (CO<sub>2</sub>). The plants (<b>15</b>) produce a gas containing a ripening component (<b>16</b>). The ripening component (<b>16</b>) is, for example, ethylene. The ripening of the plants (<b>15</b>) is accelerated by the ripening component (<b>16</b>).</p>
<p id="p-0021" num="0020">&#x3c;Refrigeration Apparatus&#x3e;</p>
<p id="p-0022" num="0021">The refrigeration apparatus (<b>10</b>) includes a refrigeration casing (<b>12</b>), a refrigerant circuit (<b>20</b>) configured to perform a refrigeration cycle, and a refrigeration control unit (<b>100</b>) (see <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref>).</p>
<p id="p-0023" num="0022">The container body (<b>2</b>) has a shape of an elongated rectangular parallelepiped box with its one end open. The refrigeration casing (<b>12</b>) is attached to the periphery of the opening of the container body (<b>2</b>) to close the open end of the container body (<b>2</b>).</p>
<p id="p-0024" num="0023">A lower portion of the refrigeration casing (<b>12</b>) is formed so as to protrude into the container body (<b>2</b>). Thus, a first storage space (S<b>1</b>) is formed at the lower portion of the refrigeration casing (<b>12</b>) on the external side of the container body (<b>2</b>).</p>
<p id="p-0025" num="0024">The first storage space (S<b>1</b>) houses a compressor (<b>21</b>), a condenser (<b>22</b>), the air composition adjustment device (<b>50</b>), and an external fan (<b>25</b>). The condenser (<b>22</b>) is disposed in the middle of the first storage space (S<b>1</b>) in the vertical direction. The compressor (<b>21</b>) and the air composition adjustment device (<b>50</b>) are arranged below the condenser (<b>22</b>). The external fan (<b>25</b>) is arranged above the condenser (<b>22</b>).</p>
<p id="p-0026" num="0025">A second storage space (S<b>2</b>) is formed at an upper portion of the refrigeration casing (<b>12</b>) on the internal side of the container body (<b>2</b>). The second storage space (S<b>2</b>) houses an evaporator (<b>24</b>) and an internal fan (<b>26</b>). The internal fan (<b>26</b>) is disposed above the evaporator (<b>24</b>).</p>
<p id="p-0027" num="0026">A partition plate (<b>18</b>) is disposed in the container body (<b>2</b>). The partition plate (<b>18</b>) is disposed to face an inner surface of the refrigeration casing (<b>12</b>). The partition plate (<b>18</b>) separates the second storage space (S<b>2</b>) from the internal space (S) of the container body (<b>2</b>) where the plants (<b>15</b>) are stored.</p>
<p id="p-0028" num="0027">A suction port (<b>18</b><i>a</i>) is formed between the upper end of the partition plate (<b>18</b>) and a ceiling surface in the container body (<b>2</b>). Inside air of the container body (<b>2</b>) is taken into the second storage space (S<b>2</b>) through the suction port (<b>18</b><i>a</i>).</p>
<p id="p-0029" num="0028">A blow-out port (<b>18</b><i>b</i>) is formed between the lower end of the partition plate (<b>18</b>) and a bottom surface in the container body (<b>2</b>). Through the blow-out port (<b>18</b><i>b</i>), the air which has been cooled by the refrigeration apparatus (<b>10</b>) is blown into the container body (<b>2</b>).</p>
<p id="p-0030" num="0029">&#x3c;Operation of Refrigeration Apparatus&#x3e;</p>
<p id="p-0031" num="0030">As illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref>, the refrigerant circuit (<b>20</b>) is a closed circuit in which the compressor (<b>21</b>), the condenser (<b>22</b>), an expansion valve (<b>23</b>), and the evaporator (<b>24</b>) are connected together in this order by a refrigerant pipe (<b>20</b><i>a</i>). A refrigerant circulates in the refrigerant circuit (<b>20</b>) to perform a vapor compression refrigeration cycle.</p>
<p id="p-0032" num="0031">The refrigeration control unit (<b>100</b>) controls operations of the compressor (<b>21</b>), the expansion valve (<b>23</b>), the external fan (<b>25</b>), and the internal fan (<b>26</b>). The refrigeration control unit (<b>100</b>) performs a cooling operation to cool the inside air of the container body (<b>2</b>).</p>
<p id="p-0033" num="0032">The external fan (<b>25</b>) sends air (outside air) of the external space of the container body (<b>2</b>) to the condenser (<b>22</b>). In the condenser (<b>22</b>), heat is exchanged between the refrigerant compressed in the compressor (<b>21</b>) and flowing through the condenser (<b>22</b>) and the outside air sent to the condenser (<b>22</b>) by the external fan (<b>25</b>).</p>
<p id="p-0034" num="0033">The internal fan (<b>26</b>) sucks the inside air of the container body (<b>2</b>) from the suction port (<b>18</b><i>a</i>), and blows the air to the evaporator (<b>24</b>). In the evaporator (<b>24</b>), heat is exchanged between the refrigerant decompressed by the expansion valve (<b>23</b>) and flowing through the evaporator (<b>24</b>) and the inside air sent to the evaporator (<b>24</b>) by the internal fan (<b>26</b>), thereby cooling the inside air.</p>
<p id="p-0035" num="0034">The inside air cooled by the evaporator (<b>24</b>) is blown again into the container body (<b>2</b>) via the blow-out port (<b>18</b><i>b</i>). Thus, air in the internal space (S) of the container body (<b>2</b>) is cooled.</p>
<p id="p-0036" num="0035">&#x3c;Air Composition Adjustment Device&#x3e;</p>
<p id="p-0037" num="0036">As illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref>, the air composition adjustment device (<b>50</b>) includes a gas supply unit (<b>30</b>) (air composition adjuster) and an air composition control unit (<b>40</b>). The air composition adjustment device (<b>50</b>) adjusts an oxygen concentration and a carbon dioxide concentration in the inside air of the container body (<b>2</b>). The term &#x201c;concentration&#x201d; to be used in the followinu description always indicates a &#x201c;volumetric concentration.&#x201d;</p>
<p id="p-0038" num="0037">The gas supply unit (<b>30</b>) is a unit for generating component-adjusted air. In this embodiment, the gas supply unit (<b>30</b>) generates nitrogen-enriched air having a low oxygen concentration, which is to be supplied into the internal space (S) of the container body (<b>2</b>). The gas supply unit (<b>30</b>) employs vacuum pressure swing adsorption (VPSA).</p>
<p id="p-0039" num="0038">The gas supply unit (<b>30</b>) has an air pump (<b>31</b>), a first directional con valve (<b>32</b>), a second directional control valve (<b>33</b>), and an air circuit (<b>3</b>). A first adsorption column (<b>34</b>) and a second adsorption column (<b>35</b>) are connected to the air circuit (<b>3</b>). An adsorbent for adsorbing a nitrogen component in the air is provided in each of the first adsorption column (<b>34</b>) and the second adsorption column (<b>35</b>). The components of the air circuit (<b>3</b>) are housed in a unit case (<b>36</b>).</p>
<p id="p-0040" num="0039">The air pump (<b>31</b>) has a first pump mechanism (<b>31</b><i>a</i>) and a second pump mechanism (<b>31</b><i>b</i>). The first pump mechanism (<b>31</b><i>a</i>) constitutes a compression pump mechanism configured to compress, and discharge, sucked air. The second pump mechanism (<b>31</b><i>b</i>) constitutes a decompression pump mechanism. The first pump mechanism (<b>31</b><i>a</i>) and the second pump mechanism (<b>31</b><i>b</i>) are connected to the drive shaft of a motor (<b>31</b><i>c</i>).</p>
<p id="p-0041" num="0040">Components, such as the air pump (<b>31</b>), are connected to the air circuit (<b>3</b>). The air circuit (<b>3</b>) includes an outside air passage (<b>41</b>), a compression passage (<b>42</b>), a decompression passage (<b>43</b>), a supply passage (<b>44</b>), and an oxygen discharge passage (<b>45</b>).</p>
<p id="p-0042" num="0041">The outside air passage (<b>41</b>) passes through the unit case (<b>36</b>) from the inside to the outside. One end of the outside air passage (<b>41</b>) is connected to a suction port of the first pump mechanism (<b>31</b><i>a</i>). A membrane filter (<b>37</b>) is provided at the other end of the outside air passage (<b>41</b>).</p>
<p id="p-0043" num="0042">One end of the compression passage (<b>42</b>) is connected to a discharge port of the first pump mechanism (<b>31</b><i>a</i>). The other end of the compression passage (<b>42</b>) is divided into two branches, which are connected to the first and second directional control valves (<b>32</b>) and (<b>33</b>), respectively.</p>
<p id="p-0044" num="0043">One end of the decompression passage (<b>43</b>) is connected to a suction port of the second pump mechanism (<b>31</b><i>b</i>). The other end of the decompression passage (<b>43</b>) is divided into two branches, which are connected to the first and second directional control valves (<b>32</b>) and (<b>33</b>), respectively. One end of the supply passage (<b>44</b>) is connected to a discharge port of the second pump mechanism (<b>31</b><i>b</i>). The other end of the supply passage (<b>44</b>) is open in the second storage space (S<b>2</b>) of the container body (<b>2</b>). A check valve (<b>55</b>) is provided at the other end portion of the supply passage (<b>44</b>). The check valve (<b>55</b>) allows the air to flow toward the second storage space (S<b>2</b>) and prevents backflow of the air.</p>
<p id="p-0045" num="0044">Two fans (<b>49</b>) are provided near the lateral side of the air pump (<b>31</b>). The fans (<b>49</b>) blow air toward the air pump (<b>31</b>) to cool the air pump (<b>31</b>).</p>
<p id="p-0046" num="0045">The first pump mechanism (<b>31</b><i>a</i>), which serves as the compression pump mechanism, supplies compressed air to one of the first adsorption column (<b>34</b>) or the second adsorption column (<b>35</b>), thereby performing an adsorption operation of causing the nitrogen component in the compressed air to be adsorbed on the adsorbent in the adsorption column.</p>
<p id="p-0047" num="0046">The second pump mechanism (<b>31</b><i>b</i>), which serves as the decompression pump mechanism, sucks air from inside of the other one of the first adsorption column (<b>34</b>) or the second adsorption column (<b>35</b>), thereby performing a desorption operation of desorbing the nitrogen component adsorbed on the adsorbent in the adsorption column. The desorption operation generates nitrogen-enriched air.</p>

<p id="p-0104" num="0103">In step ST<b>24</b>, the ripening control unit (<b>70</b>) performs the ripening operation for supplying the ripening component (<b>16</b>) to the internal space (S). In the ripening operation, the ripening control unit (<b>70</b>) makes the second on-off valve (<b>82</b>) and the third on-off valve (<b>83</b>) in an open state. The ripening control unit (<b>70</b>) activates the compression/decompression device (<b>65</b>) and adjusts the opening degree of the adjustment valve (<b>85</b>).
