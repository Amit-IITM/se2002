<p id="p-0004" num="0003">The present invention relates inter alia to non-human animals and cells that are engineered to contain exogenous DNA, such as human immunoglobulin gene DNA, their use in medicine and the study of disease, methods for production of non-human animals and cells, and antibodies and antibody chains produced by such animals and derivatives thereof.</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">In order to get around the problems of humanizing antibodies a number of companies set out to generate mice with human immune systems. The strategy used was to knockout the heavy and light chain loci in ES cells and complement these genetic lesions with transgenes designed to express the human heavy and light chain genes. Although fully human antibodies could be generated, these models have several major limitations:</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">(i) The size of the heavy and light chain loci (each several Mb) made it impossible to introduce the entire loci into these models. As a result the transgenic lines recovered had a very limited repertoire of V-regions, most of the constant regions were missing and important distant enhancer regions were not included in the transgenes.</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">(ii) The very low efficiency of generating the large insert transgenic lines and the complexity and time required to cross each of these into the heavy and light chain knockout strains and make them homozygous again, restricted the number of transgenic lines which could be analysed for optimal expression.</p>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">(iii) Individual antibody affinities rarely reached those which could be obtained from intact (non-transgenic) animals.</p>
<p id="p-0009" num="0008">WO2007117410 discloses chimaeric constructs for expressing chimaeric antibodies.</p>

<p id="p-0026" num="0039">In one aspect the inserted human DNA comprises at least 50% of the human heavy chain variable (V) genes, such as at least 60%, at least 70%, at least 80%, at least 90%, and in one aspect all of the human V genes.</p>
<p id="p-0027" num="0040">In one aspect the inserted human DNA comprises at least 50% of the human heavy chain diversity (D) genes, such as at least 60%, at least 70%, at least 80%, at least 90%, and in one aspect all of the human D genes.</p>
<p id="p-0028" num="0041">In one aspect the inserted human DNA comprises at least 50% of the human heavy chain joining (J) genes, such as at least 60%, at least 70%, at least 80%, at least 90%, and in one aspect all of the human J genes.</p>
<p id="p-0029" num="0042">In one aspect the inserted human DNA comprises at least 50% of the human light chain Variable (V) genes, such as at least 60%, at least 70%, at least 80%, at least 90%, and in one aspect all of the human light chain V genes.</p>
<p id="p-0030" num="0043">In one aspect the inserted human DNA comprises at least 50% of the human light chain joining (J) genes, such as at least 60%, at least 70%, at least 80%, at least 90%, and in one aspect all of the human light chain J genes.</p>
<p id="p-0031" num="0044">The inserted human genes may be derived from the same individual or different individuals, or be synthetic or represent human consensus sequences.</p>
<p id="p-0032" num="0045">Although the number of V D and J regions is variable between human individuals, in one aspect there are considered to be 51 human V genes, 27 D and 6 J genes on the heavy chain, 40 human V genes and 5 J genes on the kappa light chain and 29 human V genes and 4 J genes on the lambda light chain (Janeway and Travers, Immunobiology, Third edition)</p>
<p id="p-0033" num="0046">In one aspect the human heavy chain locus inserted into the non-human mammal contains the full repertoire of human V, D and J regions, which in the genome is in functional arrangement with the non-human mammal constant regions such that functional chimaeric antibodies can be produced between the human variable and non-human mammal constant regions. This total inserted human heavy chain genetic material is referred to herein as the human IgH VDJ region, and comprises DNA from a human genome that encodes all the exons encoding human V, D and J portions and suitably also the associated introns. Similarly, reference to the human Ig light chain kappa V and J regions herein refers to human DNA comprising all the exons encoding V and J regions and suitably also the associated introns of the human genome. Reference to the human Ig light chain lambda V and J regions herein refers to human DNA comprising all the exons encoding V and J regions and suitably also the associated introns of the human genome.</p>
<p id="p-0034" num="0047">Human variable regions are suitably inserted upstream of a non-human mammal constant region, the latter comprising all of the DNA required to encode the full constant region or a sufficient portion of the constant region to allow the formation of an effective chimaeric antibody capable of specifically recognising an antigen.</p>
<p id="p-0035" num="0048">In one aspect the chimaeric antibodies or antibody chains have a part of a host constant region sufficient to provide one or more effector functions seen in antibodies occurring naturally in a host mammal, for example that they are able interact with Fc receptors, and/or bind to complement.</p>
<p id="p-0036" num="0049">Reference to a chimaeric antibody or antibody chain having a host non mammal constant region herein therefore is not limited to the complete constant region but also includes chimaeric antibodies or chains which have all of the host constant region, or a part thereof sufficient to provide one or more effector functions. This also applies to non-human mammals and cells and methods of the invention in which human variable region DNA may be inserted into the host genome such that it forms a chimaeric antibody chain with all or part of a host constant region. In one aspect the whole of a host constant region is operably linked to human variable region DNA.</p>
<p id="p-0037" num="0050">The host non-human mammal constant region herein is preferably the endogenous host wild-type constant region located at the wild type locus, as appropriate for the heavy or light chain. For example, the human heavy chain DNA is suitably inserted on mouse chromosome 12, suitably adjacent the mouse heavy chain constant region.</p>
<p id="p-0038" num="0051">In one aspect the insertion of the human DNA, such as the human VDJ region is targeted to the region between the J4 exon and the C&#x3bc; locus in the mouse genome IgH locus, and in one aspect is inserted between co-ordinates 114,667,090 and 114,665,190, or at co-ordinate 114,667,091, after 114,667,090. In one aspect the insertion of the human DNA, such as the human light chain kappa VJ is targeted into mouse chromosome 6 between co-ordinates 70,673,899 and 70,675,515, suitably at position 70,674,734, or an equivalent position in the lambda mouse locus on chromosome 16.</p>
<p id="p-0039" num="0052">In one aspect the host non-human mammal constant region for forming the chimaeric antibody may be at a different (non endogenous) chromosomal locus. In this case the inserted human DNA, such as the human variable VDJ or VJ region(s) may then be inserted into the non-human genome at a site which is distinct from that of the naturally occurring heavy or light constant region. The native constant region may be inserted into the genome, or duplicated within the genome, at a different chromosomal locus to the native position, such that it is in a functional arrangement with the human variable region such that chimaeric antibodies of the invention can still be produced.</p>
<p id="p-0040" num="0053">In one aspect the human DNA is inserted at the endogenous host wild-type constant region located at the wild type locus between the host constant region and the host VDJ region.</p>
<p id="p-0041" num="0054">Reference to location of the variable region upstream of the non-human mammal constant region means that there is a suitable relative location of the two antibody portions, variable and constant, to allow the variable and constant regions to form a chimaeric antibody or antibody chain in vivo in the mammal. Thus, the inserted human DNA and host constant region are in functional arrangement with one another for antibody or antibody chain production.</p>
<p id="p-0042" num="0055">In one aspect the inserted human DNA is capable of being expressed with different host constant regions through isotype switching. In one aspect isotype switching does not require or involve trans switching. Insertion of the human variable region DNA on the same chromosome as the relevant host constant region means that there is no need for trans-switching to produce isotype switching.</p>
<p id="p-0043" num="0056">As explained above, the transgenic loci used for the prior art models were of human origin, thus even in those cases when the transgenes were able to complement the mouse locus so that the mice produced B-cells producing fully human antibodies, individual antibody affinities rarely reached those which could be obtained from intact (non-transgenic) animals. The principal reason for this (in addition to repertoire and expression levels described above) is the fact that the control elements of the locus are human. Thus, the signalling components, for instance to activate hyper-mutation and selection of high affinity antibodies are compromised.</p>
<p id="p-0044" num="0057">In contrast, in the present invention, host non-human mammal constant regions are maintained and it is preferred that at least one non-human mammal enhancer or other control sequence, such as a switch region, is maintained in functional arrangement with the non-human mammal constant region, such that the effect of the enhancer or other control sequence, as seen in the host mammal, is exerted in whole or in part in the transgenic animal.</p>
<p id="p-0045" num="0058">This approach above is designed to allow the full diversity of the human locus to be sampled, to allow the same high expression levels that would be achieved by non-human mammal control sequences such as enhancers, and is such that signalling in the B-cell, for example isotype switching using switch recombination sites, would still use non-human mammal sequences.</p>
<p id="p-0046" num="0059">A mammal having such a genome would produce chimaeric antibodies with human variable and non-human mammal constant regions, but these could be readily humanized, for example in a cloning step. Moreover the in vivo efficacy of these chimaeric antibodies could be assessed in these same animals.</p>
<p id="p-0047" num="0060">In one aspect the inserted human IgH VDJ region comprises, in germline configuration, all of the V, D and J regions and intervening sequences from a human.</p>
<p id="p-0048" num="0061">In one aspect 800-1000 kb of the human IgH VDJ region is inserted into the non-human mammal IgH locus, and in one aspect a 940, 950 or 960 kb fragment is inserted. Suitably this includes bases 105,400,051 to 106,368,585 from human chromosome 14.</p>
<p id="p-0049" num="0062">In one aspect the inserted IgH human fragment consists of bases 105,400,051 to 106,368,585 from chromosome 14. In one aspect the inserted human heavy chain DNA, such as DNA consisting of bases 105,400,051 to 106,368,585 from chromosome 14, is inserted into mouse chromosome 12 between the end of the mouse J4 region and the Ep region, suitably between co-ordinates 114,667,090 and 114,665,190, or at co-ordinate 114,667,091, after 114,667,090. In one aspect the insertion is between co-ordinates 114,667,089 and 114,667,090 (co-ordinates refer to NCBI m37, for the mouse C57BL/6J strain), or at equivalent position in another non-human mammal genome.</p>
<p id="p-0050" num="0063">In one aspect the inserted human kappa VJ region comprises, in germline configuration, all of the V and J regions and intervening sequences from a human.

In a further aspect the light chain VJ insert may comprise only the proximal clusters of V segments and J segments. Such an insert would be of approximately 473 kb. In one aspect the human light chain kappa DNA, such as the human IgK fragment of bases 88,940,356 to 89,857,000 from human chromosome 2, is suitably inserted into mouse chromosome 6 between co-ordinates 70,673,899 and 70,675,515, suitably at position 70,674,734. These co-ordinates refer to NCBI36 for the human genome, ENSEMBL Release 54 and NCBIM37 for the mouse genome, relating to mouse strain C57BL/6J.</p>

<p id="p-0052" num="0065">Suitably this includes analogous bases to those selected for the kappa fragment, from human chromosome 2.</p>
<p id="p-0053" num="0066">A cell or non-human mammal of the invention, in one embodiment, comprises an insertion of human heavy chain variable region DNA between co-ordinates 114,666,183 and 114,666,725, such as between 114 666 283 and 114 666 625, optionally between co-ordinates 114,666,335 and 114,666,536, optionally between 114,666,385 and 114,666,486, or between 114,666,425 and 114,666,446, or between 114,666,435 and 114,666,436 of mouse chromosome 12 with reference to NCBIM37 for the mouse genome, relating to mouse strain C57BL/6J or an equivalent position of mouse chromosome 12 from a different mouse strain or an equivalent position in the genome of another non-human vertebrate, e.g., a rat. The insertion between co-ordinates 114,666,435 and 114,666,436 relating to mouse strain C57BL/6J is equivalent to an insertion between co-ordinates 1207826 and 1207827 on chromosome 12 with reference to the 129/SvJ genomic sequence of the GenBank&#xae; access number NT114985.2. An insertion may be made at equivalent position in another genome, such as another mouse genome.

<p id="p-0093" num="0120">In one aspect a non-human mammal switch sequence, suitably the endogenous switch sequence, is maintained upstream of the non-human mammal Mu constant region, suitably in its native position with respect to distance from the constant region.</p>
<p id="p-0094" num="0121">In such location the host enhancer or switch sequences are operative in vivo with the host constant region sequence(s).</p>
<p id="p-0095" num="0122">In one aspect a switch sequence is neither human, nor native in the non-human mammal, for example in one aspect a non-human mammal switch sequence is not a mouse or human switch sequence. The switch sequence may be, for example, a rodent or primate sequence, or a synthetic sequence. In particular the switch sequence may be a rat sequence where the non-human mammal is a mouse. By way of example, a mouse or human constant mu sequence may be placed under the control of a switch sequence from a rat, or chimp, or other switch sequence, suitably capable of allowing isotype switching to occur in vivo.</p>
<p id="p-0096" num="0123">In one aspect the switch sequence of the invention is a switch sequence comprising 3, 4, 5, 6 or more (up to 82) contiguous repeats of the repeat sequence GGGCT (SEQ ID no 46-50), such as a rat switch sequence. By &#x201c;rat switch&#x201d; herein it is meant that the switch is a wild-type switch corresponding to a switch from a rat genome or derived from such a switch.</p>
<p id="p-0097" num="0124">In one aspect the switch sequence of the invention is a rat switch sequence comprising the following repeats: GAGCT (296 repeats; SEQ ID No 18), GGGGT (50 repeats; SEQ ID No 19), and GGGCT (83 repeats; SEQ ID No 20).</p>
<p id="p-0098" num="0125">In one example the rat switch sequence comprises or consists of the sequence of SEQ ID no 1.</p>
<p id="p-0099" num="0126">In these embodiments, and where the non-human mammal is a mouse or the cell is a mouse cell, the switch is optionally a rat switch as described herein.</p>
<p id="p-0100" num="0127">Alternatively, the switch sequence present in cells or mammal of the invention is a mouse switch, eg, is from a mouse such as a mouse 129 strain or mouse C57 strain, or from a strain derived therefrom, optionally comprising or consisting of the sequence of SEQ ID no 4 or 5. By &#x201c;mouse switch&#x201d; herein it is meant that the switch is a wild-type switch corresponding to a switch from a mouse genome or derived from such a switch. In this embodiment, and where the non-human mammal is a mouse or the cell is a mouse cell, the mouse switch sequence is optionally the endogenous switch or is a mouse switch from another mouse strain.</p>
<p id="p-0101" num="0128">The cell or mammal of the invention may therefore comprise a human or non-human mammal switch sequence and a human or non-human mammal enhancer region or regions. They may be upstream of a human or non-human mammal constant region. Preferably the control sequences are able to direct expression or otherwise control the production of antibodies comprising a constant region with which they are associated. One combination envisaged is a rat switch with mouse enhancer sequences and mouse constant regions in a mouse cell.</p>
<p id="p-0102" num="0129">In one aspect the invention relates to a cell, preferably a non-human cell, or non-human mammal comprising an immunoglobulin heavy chain or light chain locus having DNA from 3 or more species. For example, the cell or animal may comprise host cell constant region DNA, one or more human V, D or J coding sequences and one or more non-human, non-host DNA regions that are able to control a region of the immunoglobulin locus, such as a switch sequence, promoter or enhancer which are able to control expression or isotype switching in vivo of the Ig DNA. In one aspect the cell or animal is a mouse and comprises additionally human DNA from the human Ig locus and additionally a non-mouse DNA sequence, such as a rat DNA sequence, capable of regulation of the mouse or human DNA.</p>
<p id="p-0103" num="0130">In another aspect the invention relates to a cell, preferably non-human cell, or non-human mammal comprising an immunoglobulin heavy chain or light chain locus having DNA from 2 or more different human genomes. For example, it could comprise heavy chain V(D)J sequences from more than one human genome within a heavy or light chain, or heavy chain VDJ DNA from one genome and light chain VJ sequences from a different genome.</p>
<p id="p-0104" num="0131">In one aspect the invention relates to a DNA fragment or cell or non-human mammal comprising an immunoglobulin heavy chain or light chain locus, or part thereof, having DNA from 2 or more species, where one species contributes a non-coding region such as a regulatory region, and the other species coding regions such as V, D, J or constant regions.</p>
<p id="p-0105" num="0132">In one aspect the human promoter and/or other control elements that are associated with the different human V, D or J regions are maintained after insertion of the human VDJ into the mouse genome.</p>
<p id="p-0106" num="0133">In a further aspect one or more of the promoter elements, or other control elements, of the human regions, such as the human V regions, are optimised to interact with the transcriptional machinery of a non-human mammal.</p>
<p id="p-0107" num="0134">Suitably a human coding sequence may be placed under the control of an appropriate non-human mammal promoter, which allows the human DNA to be transcribed efficiently in the appropriate non-human animal cell. In one aspect the human region is a human V region coding sequence, and a human V region is placed under the control of a non-human mammal promoter.</p>
<p id="p-0108" num="0135">The functional replacement of human promoter or other control regions by non-human mammal promoter or control regions may be carried out by use of recombineering, or other recombinant DNA technologies, to insert a part of the human Ig region (such as a human V region) into a vector (such as a BAC) containing a non-human Ig region. The recombineering/recombinant technique suitably replaces a portion of the non-human (e.g. mouse) DNA with the human Ig region, and thus places the human Ig region under control of the non-human mammal promoter or other control region. Suitably the human coding region for a human V region replaces a mouse V region coding sequence. Suitably the human coding region for a human D region replaces a mouse D region coding sequence. Suitably the human coding region for a human J region replaces a mouse J region coding sequence. In this way human V, D or J regions may be placed under the control of a non-human mammal promoter, such as a mouse promoter.</p>
<p id="p-0109" num="0136">In one aspect the only human DNA inserted into the non-human mammalian cell or animal are V, D or J coding regions, and these are placed under control of the host regulatory sequences or other (non-human, non-host) sequences, In one aspect reference to human coding regions includes both human introns and exons, or in another aspect simply exons and no introns, which may be in the form of cDNA.</p>
<p id="p-0110" num="0137">It is also possible to use recombineering, or other recombinant DNA technologies, to insert a non-human-mammal (e.g. mouse) promoter or other control region, such as a promoter for a V region, into a BAC containing a human Ig region. A recombineering step then places a portion of human DNA under control of the mouse promoter or other control region.</p>
<p id="p-0111" num="0138">The approaches described herein may also be used to insert some or all of the V, D and J regions from the human heavy chain upstream of a light chain constant region, rather than upstream of the heavy chain constant region. Likewise some or all of the human light chain V and J regions may be inserted upstream of the heavy chain constant region. Insertion may be at the endogenous constant region locus, for example between the endogenous constant and J region, and may be of some, or all, of the V, D or J genes alone, excluding promoter or enhancer sequences, or may be of some, or all, of the V, D or J genes with one or more or all respective promoter or enhancer sequences. In one aspect the full repertoire of V, D or J fragments in germline orientation may be inserted upstream and in functional arrangement with a host constant region.</p>
<p id="p-0112" num="0139">Thus the present invention allows V and/or D and/or J regions from a human, or any species, to be inserted into a chromosome of a cell from a different species that comprises a constant region, allowing a chimaeric antibody chain to be expressed.</p>
<p id="p-0113" num="0140">In one aspect the invention requires only that some human variable region DNA is inserted into the genome of a non-human mammal in operable arrangement with some, or all, of the human heavy chain constant region at the region of the endogenous heavy chain constant region locus such that an antibody chain can be produced. In this aspect of the invention and where human light chain DNA is additionally inserted, the light chain DNA insertion can be in the form of a completely human construct, having both human variable DNA and human constant region DNA, or have human variable region DNA and constant region DNA from a non-human, non-host species. Other variations are also possible, such as insertion of both of the light chain human variable region and host genome constant region. In addition the insertion of said light chain transgenes need not be at the equivalent endogenous locus, but may be anywhere in the genome. In such a scenario the cell or mammal may produce chimaeric heavy chains (comprising human variable region DNA and mouse constant region DNA) and light chains comprising human variable and human constant region DNA. Thus in one aspect of the invention the lambda and or kappa human variable region DNA can be inserted upstream of the endogenous locus, or downstream, or indeed on a different chromosome to the endogenous locus, and inserted with or without constant region DNA.</p>
<p id="p-0114" num="0141">As well insertion of human light chain DNA upstream of the host non-human mammal constant region, a further aspect of the invention relates to insertion of one or both light chain human variable regions downstream of the equivalent endogenous locus constant region, or elsewhere in the genome.</p>
<p id="p-0115" num="0142">Generally, insertion of human variable region DNA at or close to the equivalent endogenous locus in the recipient genome is preferred, for example within 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, or 10 kb of the boundary (upstream or downstream) of a host immunoglobulin locus.</p>
<p id="p-0116" num="0143">Thus in one aspect the invention can relate to a cell or non-human mammal whose genome comprises:

    </ul>
    </li>
</ul>
</p>
<p id="p-0118" num="0151">In a further, different, aspect of the invention, the use of the methods of the invention allows a locus to be built up in a stepwise manner by sequential insertions, and thus allows for the insertion of human variable DNA together with human or non-human constant region DNA at any suitable location in the genome of a non-human host cell. For example, methods of the invention can be used to insert human immunoglobulin variable region DNA together with constant region DNA from the host genome anywhere in the genome of a non-human host cell, allowing a chimaeric antibody chain to be produced from a site other than the endogenous heavy region. Any human heavy chain or light chain DNA construct contemplated above can be inserted into any desired position into the genome of a non-human host cell using the techniques described herein. The present invention thus also relates to cells and mammals having genomes comprising such insertions.</p>
<p id="p-0119" num="0152">The invention also relates to a vector, such as a BAC, comprising a human V, D or J region in a functional arrangement with a non-human mammal promoter, or other control sequence, such that the expression of the human V, D or J region is under the control of the non-human mammal promoter in a cell of the non-human mammal, such as an ES cell, in particular once inserted into the genome of that cell.</p>
<p id="p-0120" num="0153">The invention also relates to cells and non-human mammals containing said cells, which cells or mammals have a human V, D or J region in a functional arrangement with a non-human mammal promoter, or other control sequence, such that the expression of the human V, D or J region is under the control of the non-human mammal promoter in the cells or mammal.</p>
<p id="p-0121" num="0154">Generally, one aspect of the invention thus relates to a non-human mammal host cell capable of expression of a human V, D or J coding sequence under the control of a host promoter or control region, the expression capable of producing a humanised antibody having a human variable domain and non-human mammal constant region.</p>

<p id="p-0124" num="0161">In one aspect the cell is an ES cell is capable of developing into a non-human mammal able to produce a repertoire of antibodies which are chimaeric, said chimaeric antibodies having a non-human mammal constant region and a human variable region. Optionally the genome of the cell is modified to prevent expression of fully host-species specific antibodies.</p>
<p id="p-0125" num="0162">In one aspect the cell is an induced pluripotent stem cell (iPS cell).</p>
<p id="p-0126" num="0163">In one aspect cells are isolated non-human mammalian cells.</p>
<p id="p-0127" num="0164">In one aspect a cell as disclosed herein is preferably a non-human mammalian cell.</p>
<p id="p-0128" num="0165">In one aspect the cell is a cell from a mouse strain selected from C57BL/6, M129 such as 129/SV, BALB/c, and any hybrid of C57BL/6, M129 such as 129/SV, or BALB/c.</p>
<p id="p-0129" num="0166">The invention also relates to a cell line which is grown from or otherwise derived from cells as described herein, including an immortalised cell line. The cell line may comprise inserted human V, D or J genes as described herein, either in germline configuration or after rearrangement following in vivo maturation. The cell may be immortalised by fusion (eg, electrofusion or using PEG according to standard procedures.) to a tumour cell (eg, P3X63-Ag8.653 (obtainable from LGC Standards; CRL-1580), SP2/0-Ag14 (obtainable from ECACC), NSI or NSO), to provide an antibody producing cell and cell line, or be made by direct cellular immortalisation.</p>
<p id="p-0130" num="0167">The present invention also relates to vectors for use in the invention. In one aspect such vectors are BACs (bacterial artificial chromosomes). It will be appreciated that other cloning vectors may be used in the invention, and therefore reference to BACs herein may be taken to refer generally to any suitable vector.</p>
<p id="p-0131" num="0168">In one aspect BACs used for generation of human DNA to be inserted, such as the VDJ or VJ regions are trimmed so that in the final human VDJ or VJ region or part thereof in the non-human mammal, no sequence is duplicated or lost when compared to the original human genomic sequence.</p>
<p id="p-0132" num="0169">In one aspect the invention relates to a vector comprising an insert, preferably comprising a region of human DNA from some of the human VDJ or VJ locus, flanked by DNA which is not from that locus. The flanking DNA may comprise one or more selectable markers or one or more site specific recombination sites. In one aspect the vector comprises 2 or more, such as 3, heterospecific and incompatible site specific recombination sites. In one aspect the site specific recombination sites may be loxP sites, or variants thereof, or FRT sites or variants thereof. In one aspect the vector comprises one or more transposon ITR (inverted terminal repeat) sequences.</p>
<p id="p-0133" num="0170">In one aspect the non-human animals of the invention suitably do not produce any fully humanised antibodies. In one aspect this is because there is no DNA inserted from the human constant region. Alternatively there is no human constant region DNA in the genome capable of forming an antibody in conjunction with the inserted human variable region DNA component, for example due to mutation within any human constant region DNA or distance from any constant region human DNA and human variable region DNA.</p>
<p id="p-0134" num="0171">In one aspect human light chain constant region DNA may be included in the cell genome, such that a fully human lambda or kappa human antibody chain might be generated, but this would only be able to form an antibody with a chimaeric heavy chain, and not produce a fully human antibody having human variable and constant regions.</p>
<p id="p-0135" num="0172">In one aspect the non-human mammal genome is modified to prevent expression of fully host-species specific antibodies. Fully host species specific antibodies are antibodies that have both variable and constant regions from the host organism. In this context the term &#x2018;specific&#x2019; is not intended to relate to the binding of the antibodies produced by the cells or animals of the invention but rather to the origin of the DNA which encodes those antibodies.</p>
<p id="p-0136" num="0173">In one aspect the non-human mammal genome is modified to prevent expression of the native (fully host species specific) antibodies in the mammal by inactivation of all or a part of the host non-human mammal Ig loci. In this context, inactivation or prevention of endogenous antibody or gene segment usage (using any inactivation technique described herein) is, for example, substantially complete inactivation or prevention (substantially 100%, ie, essentially none (eg, less than 10, 5, 4, 3, 2, 1 or 0.5%) of the endogenous antibody chain (eg, no endogenous heavy chains) is expressed). This can be determined, for example, at the antibody chain (protein) level by assessing the antibody repertoire produced by the non-human vertebrate, mammal or at the nucleotide level by assessing mRNA transcripts of antibody chain loci, eg, using RACE. In an embodiment, inactivation is more than 50% (ie, 50% or less of the antibodies or transcripts are of an endogenous antibody chain), 60%, 70%, 80%, 85%, 90%, 95%, 96%, 97%, 98% or 99%. For example, in an embodiment, endogenous heavy chain expression is substantially inactivated such that no more than 85%, 90%, 95%, 96%, 97%, 98% or 99% of the heavy chain repertoire of the vertebrate (mammal) is provided by endogenous heavy chains. For example, endogenous heavy chain expression is substantially inactivated such that substantially none of the heavy chain repertoire of the vertebrate (mammal) is provided by endogenous heavy chains. For example, in an embodiment, endogenous heavy chain expression is substantially inactivated such that no more than 85%, 90%, 95%, 96%, 97%, 98% or 99% of the kappa chain repertoire of the vertebrate (mammal) is provided by endogenous kappa chains. For example, endogenous kappa chain expression is substantially inactivated such that substantially none of the kappa chain repertoire of the vertebrate (mammal) is provided by endogenous kappa chains. For example, in an embodiment, endogenous heavy chain expression is substantially inactivated such that no more than 85%, 90%, 95%, 96%, 97%, 98% or 99% of the lambda chain repertoire of the vertebrate (mammal) is provided by endogenous lambda chains. For example, endogenous lambda chain expression is substantially inactivated such that substantially none of the lambda chain repertoire of the vertebrate (mammal) is provided by endogenous lambda chains.</p>
<p id="p-0137" num="0174">In one aspect this is achieved by inversion of all or part of the non-human mammal VDJ region, or VJ region, optionally by insertion of one or more site specific recombinase sites into the genome and then use of these sites in recombinase-mediated excision or inversion of all or a part of the non-human mammal Ig locus. In one aspect a double inversion, may be employed, the first to move the V(D)Js away from the endogenous locus and then a more local inversion which puts them in the correct orientation. In one aspect a single loxP site is used to invert the non-human mammal VDJ region to a centromeric locus or telomeric locus.</p>
<p id="p-0138" num="0175">In one example, a mouse or mouse cell of the invention comprises inverted endogenous heavy chain gene segments (eg, VH, D and JH, such as the entire endogenous heavy chain VDJ region) that are immediately 3&#x2032; of position 119753123, 119659458 or 120918606 on an endogenous mouse chromosome 12. Optionally, the genome of the mouse or cell is homozygous for said chromosome 12.</p>

<p id="p-0140" num="0177">A cassette for inversion and inactivation of endogenous non-human vertebrate (eg, mouse or rat) antibody chain gene segments, the segments being part of an antibody chain locus sequence on a chromosome of a non-human vertebrate (eg, mouse or rat) cell (eg, ES cell) wherein the sequence is flanked at its 3&#x2032; end by a site-specific recombination site (eg, lox, rox or frt), the cassette comprising a nucleotide sequence encoding an expressible label or selectable marker and a compatible site-specific recombination site (eg, lox, rox or frt) flanked by a 5&#x2032; and a 3&#x2032; homology arm, wherein the homology arms correspond to or are homologous to adjacent stretches of sequence in the cell genome on a different chromosome or on said chromosome at least 10, 15, 20, 25, 30, 35, 40, 45 or 50 mb away from the endogenous gene segments.</p>

<p id="p-0145" num="0185">Thus, the invention provides a mouse or mouse cell whose genome comprises an inversion of a chromosome 12, wherein the inversion comprises inverted endogenous heavy chain gene segments (eg, VH, D and JH, such as the entire endogenous heavy chain VDJ region); wherein the mouse comprises a transgenic heavy chain locus comprising a plurality of human VH gene segments, a plurality of human D segments and a plurality of human JH segments operably connected upstream of an endogenous constant region (eg, C mu) so that the mouse or cell (optionally following differentiation into a B-cell) is capable of expressing an antibody comprising a variable region comprising sequences derived from the human gene segments; and wherein the inversion is (i) an inversion of mouse chromosome 12 from coordinate 119753123 to coordinate 114666436; (ii) an inversion of mouse chromosome 12 from coordinate 119659458 to coordinate 114666436; or (iii) an inversion of mouse chromosome 12 from coordinate 12091806 to coordinate 114666436.</p>
<p id="p-0146" num="0186">In one embodiment, the endogenous gene segments are from a 129-derived mouse cell (eg, segments from an AB2.1 cell) and the homology arms are isogenic DNA (ie, identical to 129-derived endogenous sequences demarcated by the respective coordinates stated in (i) to (iii) above). Thus, no new sequence is created by homologous recombination using these homology arms. In another embodiment, the arms are from a mouse strain that is different from the endogenous strain. The site-specific recombination sites are mutually compatible and mutually inverted such that, on expression of an associated recombinase enzyme (eg, Cre, Dre or Flp), recombination between the site in the inserted inversion cassette and the site flanking the endogenous gene segments is carried out, thereby inverting and moving the endogenous gene segments far upstream (5&#x2032;) of their original location in the heavy chain locus. This inactivates endogenous heavy chain expression. Similarly, light chain inactivation can be performed by choosing the homology arms of the inversion cassette with reference to a chromosomal region spaced at least 10, 15, 20, 25, 30, 35, 40, 45 or 50 mb away from the endogenous light chain locus, the latter comprising a site-specific recombination site that is compatible with the site in the inversion cassette.</p>
<p id="p-0147" num="0187">In one embodiment, the expressible label is a fluorescent label, eg, GFP or a variant thereof (eg, YFP, CFP or RFP). Thus, a label is used instead of a selection marker, such as one that confers resistance to allow for selection of transformants.</p>

        <li id="ul0034-0005" num="0193">(v) Optionally developing the cell into a progeny cell or vertebrate (eg, mouse or rat) whose genome is homozygous for the inversion.</li>
    </ul>
    </li>
</ul>
</p>
<p id="p-0149" num="0194">The genome of the progeny cell or vertebrate can comprise transgenic heavy and/or light chain loci, each capable of expressing antibody chains comprising human variable regions. Optionally, endogenous heavy and kappa light chain expression is inactivated by inverting endogenous heavy and kappa variable region gene segments according to the method of the invention. Optionally, endogenous lambda chain expression is also inactivated in this way.</p>
<p id="p-0150" num="0195">In an alternative to the method and inversion cassettes of the invention, instead of inverting and moving variable region gene segments only, other parts of the endogenous locus can alternatively or additionally be inverted and moved to effect inactivation. For example, one or more endogenous regulatory elements (eg, Smu and/or Emu) and/or one or more endogenous constant regions (eg, Cmu and/or Cgamma) can be inverted and moved.</p>
<p id="p-0151" num="0196">Sites that &#x201c;flank&#x201d; in the above contexts of the invention can be provided such that a site-specific recombination site immediately flanks the endogenous sequence or is spaced therefrom, eg, by no more than 250, 200, 250, 100, 50 or 20 kb in the 3&#x2032; direction.</p>
<p id="p-0152" num="0197">In one aspect the non-human mammal genome into which human DNA is inserted comprises endogenous V, (D) and J regions, and the endogenous sequences have not been deleted.</p>
<p id="p-0153" num="0198">The invention comprises a method for insertion of multiple DNA fragments into a DNA target, suitably to form a contiguous insertion in which the inserted fragments are joined together directly without intervening sequences. The method is especially applicable to the insertion of a large DNA fragment into a host chromosome which can be carried out in a stepwise fashion.</p>
<p id="p-0154" num="0199">In one aspect the method comprises insertion of a first DNA sequence into a target, the sequence having a DNA vector portion and a first sequence of interest (X1); insertion of a second DNA sequence into the vector portion of the first sequence, the second DNA sequence having a second sequence of interest (X2) and a second vector portion; and then excising any vector sequence DNA separating X1 and X2 to provide a contiguous X1X2, or X2X1 sequence within the target. There is optionally insertion of a further one or more DNA sequences, each DNA sequence having a further sequence of interest (X3, . . . ) and a further vector portion, into the vector portion of the preceding DNA sequence, to build up a contiguous DNA fragment in the target.</p>
<p id="p-0155" num="0200">The DNA target for insertion of the first DNA sequence may be a specific site or any point in the genome of a particular cell.</p>
<p id="p-0156" num="0201">The general method is described herein in relation to the insertion of elements of the human VDJ region, but is applicable to insertion of any DNA region, from any organism, and in particular insertion of large DNA fragments of &#x3e;100 kB, such as 100-250 kb, or even larger, such as that of the TCR or HLA. Features and approaches described herein in respect of the VDJ insertion may be equally applied to the any of the methods disclosed</p>
<p id="p-0157" num="0202">In one aspect the inserted DNA is human DNA, such as the human VDJ or VJ region, is built up in the genome of a cell, such as an ES cell, in a stepwise manner using 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 20 or more separate insertions for each heavy chain or light chain region. Fragments are suitably inserted at the same or substantially the same cell locus, e.g. ES cell locus, one after another, to form the complete VDJ or VJ region, or part thereof. The present invention also relates to cells and non-human animals comprising intermediates in the process whose genomes may comprise only a partial VDJ region, such as only human variable region DNA.</p>
<p id="p-0158" num="0203">In a further aspect the method for producing a transgenic non-human mammal comprises the insertion of human VDJ or VJ regions upstream of the host non-human mammal constant region by step-wise insertion of multiple fragments by homologous recombination, preferably using an iterative process. Suitably fragments of approximately 100 KB from the human VDJ and VJ locus are inserted, suitably to form part of, or a complete, VDJ or VJ region after the final iteration of the insertion process, as disclosed herein.</p>
<p id="p-0159" num="0204">In one aspect the insertion process commences at a site where an initiation cassette has been inserted into the genome of a cell, such as an ES cell, providing a unique targeting region. In one aspect the initiation cassette is inserted in the non-human mammal heavy chain locus, for use in insertion of human heavy chain DNA. Similarly an initiation cassette may be inserted in the non-human mammal light chain locus, for use in insertion of human light chain VJ DNA The initiation cassette suitably comprises a vector backbone sequence with which a vector having a human DNA fragment in the same backbone sequence can recombine to insert the human DNA into the cell (e.g. ES) cell genome, and suitably a selection marker, such as a negative selection marker. Suitably the vector backbone sequence is that of a BAC library, to allow BACs to be used in the construction of the ES cells and mammals. The vector backbone sequence may however be any sequence which serves as a target site into which a homologous sequence can insert, for example by homologous recombination, for example RMCE, and is preferably not DNA encoding any of the VDJ or constant region.</p>
<p id="p-0160" num="0205">In one aspect the insertion of the first DNA fragment into an initiation cassette is followed by insertion of a second DNA fragment into a portion of the first DNA fragment, suitably a part of the vector backbone of the second DNA fragment. In one aspect an inserted DNA fragment comprises a part of the human VDJ region flanked by 5&#x2032; and/or 3&#x2032; sequences that are not from the human VDJ region. In one aspect the 5&#x2032; and/or 3&#x2032; flanking sequences may each contain one or more selectable markers, or be capable of creating a selectable system once inserted into the genome. In one aspect one or both flanking sequences may be removed from the genome in vitro, or in vivo, following insertion. In one aspect the method comprises insertion of a DNA fragment followed by selection of both 5&#x2032; and 3&#x2032; ends of the inserted fragment flanking the human VDJ DNA. In one aspect the iterative insertion is made by insertion of DNA fragments at the 5&#x2032; end of the previous inserted fragment, and in this aspect there may be deletion in vivo of the vector DNA which separates the inserted human DNA sequences, to provide a contiguous human DNA sequence.</p>
<p id="p-0161" num="0206">In one aspect insertion of human VDJ DNA into a genome may be achieved without leaving any flanking DNA in the genome, for example by transposase mediate DNA excision. One suitable transposase is the Piggybac transposase.</p>
<p id="p-0162" num="0207">In one aspect the first human variable region fragment is inserted by homologous recombination at the initiation cassette backbone sequence and then the DNA of any negative selection marker and initiation cassette are subsequently removed by recombination between recombinase target sequences, such as FRT using in this example, FLPase expression. Generally repeated targeted insertions at the (e.g. BAC) backbone initiation sequence and subsequent removal by rearrangement between recombinase target sequences are repeated to build up the entire human VDJ region upstream of the host non-mammal constant region.</p>
<p id="p-0163" num="0208">In one aspect a selectable marker or system may be used in the method. The marker may be generated upon insertion of a DNA fragment into a genome, for example forming a selectable marker in conjunction with a DNA element already present in the genome.</p>
<p id="p-0164" num="0209">In one aspect the cell (e.g. ES) cell genome does not contain 2 identical selectable markers at the same time during the process. It can be seen that the iterative process of insertion and selection can be carried out using only 2 different selection markers, as disclosed in the examples herein, and for example the third selectable marker may be identical to the first marker, as by the time of insertion of the third vector fragment the first vector fragment and the first marker has been removed.</p>
<p id="p-0165" num="0210">In one aspect a correct insertion event, is confirmed before moving to the next step of any multistep cloning process, for example by confirmation of BAC structure using high density genomic arrays to screen ES cells to identify those with intact BAC insertions, sequencing and PCR verification.</p>

<p id="p-0166" num="0211">The invention also relates to a polynucleotide &#x2018;landing pad&#x2019; sequence, the polynucleotide comprising nucleic acid regions homologous to regions of a target chromosome to allow for insertion by homologous recombination into the target chromosome, and comprising a nucleic acid site which permits recombinase-driven insertion of nucleic acid into the landing pad. The invention also relates to vectors, cells and mammals of the invention comprising a landing pad as disclosed herein inserted into the genome of the cell.</p>
<p id="p-0167" num="0212">The landing pad optionally comprises a non-endogenous S-mu, e.g. a rat S-mu switch</p>
<p id="p-0168" num="0213">The landing pad optionally comprises (in 5&#x2032; to 3&#x2032; orientation) a mouse E&#x3bc; sequence, a non-human, non-mouse (e.g. rat) Switch &#x3bc; and at least a portion of a mouse C&#x3bc; or the entire mouse C&#x3bc;.</p>

Thus, a label is used instead of a selection marker (such as one that confers resistance to allow for selection of transformants).</p>
<p id="p-0173" num="0218">In an embodiment, the landing pad comprises 5&#x2032; and 3&#x2032; homology arms for insertion into the cell genome using homologous recombination. The homology arms can be isogenic DNA (eg, identical to 129-derived endogenous sequences of when a 129-derived ES cell is used). Thus, no new sequence is created by homologous recombination using these homology arms. In another embodiment, the arms are from a mouse strain that is different from the endogenous strain (ES cell strain).</p>

    <li id="ul0050-0001" num="0293">109. A non-human vertebrate (optionally a mouse or rat) or non-human vertebrate cell (optionally a mouse or rat cell) having a genome that
    <ul id="ul0051" list-style="none">
        <li id="ul0051-0001" num="0294">(i) comprises a transgenic antibody chain locus capable of expressing an antibody chain comprising a human variable region (optionally following antibody gene rearrangement); and</li>

        <li id="ul0051-0003" num="0296">(iii) a DNA sequence comprising a plurality of human antibody variable region gene segments inserted between endogenous antibody variable region gene segments and an endogenous antibody constant region, whereby endogenous antibody chain expression is inactivated.</li>
        <li id="ul0051-0004" num="0297">The transgenic locus is a heavy chain or light chain locus.</li>
        <li id="ul0051-0005" num="0298">Inactivation of endogenous heavy chain expression in non-human vertebrates such as mice and rats has involved the deletion of all or part of the endogenous heavy chain VDJ region (including sequences between gene segments). The ADAM6 genes are present in the endogenous mouse VDJ region. In mouse, there are two copies of ADAM6 (ADAM6a, ADAM6b) located between the VH and D gene segments in the IgH locus of chromosome 12 (in the intervening region between mouse VH5-1 and D1-1 gene segments). These two adjacent intronless ADAM6 genes have 95% nucleotide sequence identity and 90% amino acid identity. In human and rat, there is only one ADAM6 gene. Expression pattern analysis of mouse ADAM6 shows that it is exclusively expressed in testis [1]. Although ADAM6 transcripts can be detected in lymphocytes, it is restricted to the nucleus, suggesting that the transcription of ADAM6 gene in particular was due to transcriptional read-through from the D region rather than active messenger RNA production [2]. In rat, ADAM6 is on chromosome 6.</li>
        <li id="ul0051-0006" num="0299">Mature ADAM6 protein is located on the acrosome and the posterior regions of sperm head. Notably, ADAM6 forms a complex with ADAM2 and ADAM3, which is required for fertilization in mice [3]. Reference [4] implicates ADAM6 in a model where this protein interacts with ADAM3 after ADAM6 is sulphated by TPST2, sulphation of ADAM6 being critical for stability and/or complex formation involving ADAM6 and ADAM3, and thus ADAM6 and ADAM3 are lost from Tpst2-null sperm. The study observes that Tpst2-deficient mice have male infertility, sperm mobility defects and possible abnormalities in sperm-egg membrane interactions.</li>
        <li id="ul0051-0007" num="0300">Thus, the maintenance of ADAM6 expression in sperm is crucial for fertility. Thus, it is thought that transgenic male mice and rats in which ADAM6 genes have been deleted are not viably fertile. This hampers breeding of colonies and hampers the utility of such mice as transgenic antibody-generating platforms. It would be desirable to provide improved non-human transgenic antibody-generating vertebrates that are fertile.</li>

<p id="p-0225" num="0365">In one embodiment, the antigen is a serpin, eg, ovalbumin, antithrombin or antitrypsin. Serpins are a group of proteins with similar structures that were first identified as a set of proteins able to inhibit proteases. The acronym serpin was originally coined because many serpins inhibit chymotrypsin-like serine proteases (serine protease inhibitors). The first members of the serpin superfamily to be extensively studied were the human plasma proteins antithrombin and antitrypsin, which play key roles in controlling blood coagulation and inflammation, respectively. Initially, research focused upon their role in human disease: antithrombin deficiency results in thrombosis and antitrypsin deficiency causes emphysema. In 1980 Hunt and Dayhoff made the surprising discovery that both these molecules share significant amino acid sequence similarity to the major protein in chicken egg white, ovalbumin, and they proposed a new protein superfamily.

<p id="p-0284" num="0448">The following examples are put forth so as to provide those of ordinary skill in the art with a complete disclosure and description of how to make and use the invention, and are not intended to limit the scope of what the inventors regard as their invention.</p>
<heading id="h-0018" level="1">EXAMPLES</heading>
<heading id="h-0019" level="1">Example 1</heading>
<heading id="h-0020" level="2">BAC Recombineering</heading>
<p id="p-0285" num="0449">Overall strategy: A mouse model of the invention can be achieved by inserting &#x2dc;960 kb of the human heavy chain locus containing all the V, D and J-regions upstream of the mouse constant region and 473 kb of the human kappa region upstream of the mouse constant region. Alternatively, or in tandem, the human lambda region is inserted upstream of the mouse constant region. This insertion is achieved by gene targeting in ES cells using techniques well known in the art.</p>
<p id="p-0286" num="0450">High fidelity insertion of intact V-D-J regions into each locus in their native (wild-type) configuration is suitably achieved by insertion of human bacterial artificial chromosomes (BACs) into the locus. Suitably the BACs are trimmed so that in the final locus no sequence is duplicated or lost compared to the original. Such trimming can be carried out by recombineering.</p>
<p id="p-0287" num="0451">The relevant human BACs, suitably trimmed covering these loci are on average 90 kb in size.</p>
<p id="p-0288" num="0452">In one approach the full complement of human D and J-elements as well as seven or eight human V-regions are covered by the first BACs to be inserted in the experimental insertion scheme described below. The first BACs to be inserted in the IgH and IgK loci may contain the following V-regions. IgH: V6-1, VII-1-1, V1-2, VIII-2-1, V1-3, V4-4, V2-5 and IgK: V4-1, V5-2, V7-3, V2-4, V1-5, V1-6, V3-7, V1-8.</p>
<p id="p-0289" num="0453">Suitably the performance of each locus is assessed after the first BAC insertion using chimaeric mice and also after each subsequent BAC addition. See below for detailed description of this performance test.</p>
<p id="p-0290" num="0454">Nine additional BAC insertions will be required for the IgH locus and five for IgK to provide the full complement of human V-regions covering all 0.96 Mb and 0.473 Mb of the IgH and IgK loci, respectively.</p>
<p id="p-0291" num="0455">Not all BACs retain their wild-type configuration when inserted into the ES cell genome. Thus, high density genomic arrays were deployed to screen ES cells to identify those with intact BAC insertions (Barrett, M. T., Scheffer, A., Ben-Dor, A., Sampas, N., Lipson, D., Kincaid, R., Tsang, P., Curry, B., Baird, K., Meltzer, P. S., et al. (2004). Comparative genomic hybridization using oligonucleotide microarrays and total genomic DNA. Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America 101, 17765-17770.). This screen also enables one to identify and select against ES clones in which the ES cell genome is compromised and thus not able to populate the germ line of chimeric animals. Other suitable genomic tools to facilitate this assessment include sequencing and PCR verification.</p>
<p id="p-0292" num="0456">Thus in one aspect the correct BAC structure is confirmed before moving to the next step.</p>
<p id="p-0293" num="0457">It is implicit from the description above that in order to completely engineer the loci with 90 kb BACs, it is necessary to perform a minimum of 10 targeting steps for IgH and 5 steps for the IgK. Mice with an IgL locus can be generated in a similar manner to the IgK locus. Additional steps are required to remove the selection markers required to support gene targeting. Since these manipulations are being performed in ES cells in a step-wise manner, in one aspect germ line transmission capacity is retained throughout this process.</p>
<p id="p-0294" num="0458">Maintaining the performance of the ES cell clones through multiple rounds of manipulation without the need to test the germ line potential of the ES cell line at every step may be important in the present invention. The cell lines currently in use for the KOMP and EUCOMM global knockout projects have been modified twice prior to their use for this project and their germ line transmission rates are unchanged from the parental cells (these lines are publicly available, see World Wide Web (www) komp.org and World Wide Web (www) eucomm.org). This cell line, called JM8, can generate 100% ES cell-derived mice under published culture conditions (Pettitt, S. J., Liang, Q., Rairdan, X. Y., Moran, J. L., Prosser, H. M., Beier, D. R., Lloyd, K. C., Bradley, A., and Skarnes, W. C. (2009). Agouti C57BL/6N embryonic stem cells for mouse genetic resources. Nature Methods.). These cells have demonstrated ability to reproducibly contribute to somatic and germ line tissue of chimaeric animals using standard mouse ES cell culture conditions. This capability can be found with cells cultured on a standard feeder cell line (SNL) and even feeder-free, grown only on gelatine-coated tissue culture plates. One particular sub-line, JM8A3, maintained the ability to populate the germ line of chimeras after several serial rounds of sub-cloning. Extensive genetic manipulation via, for example, homologous recombination&#x2014;as would be the case in the present invention&#x2014;cannot compromise the pluripotency of the cells. The ability to generate chimeras with such high percentage of ES cell-derived tissue has other advantages. First, high levels of chimerism correlates with germ line transmission potential and provide a surrogate assay for germ line transmission while only taking 5 to 6 weeks. Second, since these mice are 100% ES cell derived the engineered loci can be directly tested, removing the delay caused by breeding. Testing the integrity of the new Ig loci is possible in the chimera since the host embryo will be derived from animals that are mutant for the RAG-1 gene as described in the next section.</p>
<p id="p-0295" num="0459">Another cell line that may be used is an HPRT-ve cell line, such as AB2.1, as disclosed in Ramirez-Solis R, Liu P and Bradley A, &#x201c;Chromosome engineering in mice,&#x201d; Nature, 1995; 378; 6558; 720-4.</p>
<p id="p-0296" num="0460">RAG-1 complementation: While many clones will generate 100% ES derived mice some will not. Thus, at every step mice are generated in a RAG-1-deficient background. This provides mice with 100% ES-derived B- and T-cells which can be used directly for immunization and antibody production. Cells having a RAG-2 deficient background, or a combined RAG-1/RAG-2 deficient background may be used, or equivalent mutations in which mice produce only ES cell-derived B cells and/or T cells.</p>
<p id="p-0297" num="0461">In order that only the human-mouse IgH or IgK loci are active in these mice, the human-mouse IgH and IgK loci can be engineered in a cell line in which one allele of the IgH or IgK locus has already been inactivated. Alternatively the inactivation of the host Ig locus, such as the IgH or IgK locus, can be carried out after insertion.</p>
<p id="p-0298" num="0462">Mouse strains that have the RAG-1 gene mutated are immunodeficient as they have no mature B- or T-lymphocytes (U.S. Pat. No. 5,859,307). T- and B-lymphocytes only differentiate if proper V(D)J recombination occurs. Since RAG-1 is an enzyme that is crucial for this recombination, mice lacking RAG-1 are immunodeficient. If host embryos are genetically RAG-1 homozygous mutant, a chimera produced by injecting such an embryo will not be able to produce antibodies if the animal's lymphoid tissues are derived from the host embryo. However, JM8 cells and AB2.1 cells, for example, generally contribute in excess of 80% of the somatic tissues of the chimeric animal and would therefore usually populate the lymphoid tissue. JM8 cells have wild-type RAG-1 activity and therefore antibodies produced in the chimeric animal would be encoded by the engineered JM8 ES cell genome only. Therefore, the chimeric animal can be challenged with an antigen by immunization and subsequently produce antibodies to that antigen. This allows one skilled in the art to test the performance of the engineered human/mouse IgH and IgK loci as described in the present invention. See <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>19</b> and <b>20</b></figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0299" num="0463">One skilled in the art would use the chimeric animal as described to determine the extent of antibody diversity (see e.g. Harlow, E. &#x26; Lane, D. 1998, 5th edition, Antibodies: A Laboratory Manual, Cold Spring Harbor Lab. Press, Plainview, N.Y.). For example, the existence in the chimeric animal's serum of certain antibody epitopes could be ascertained by binding to specific anti-idiotype antiserum, for example, in an ELISA assay. One skilled in the art could also sequence the genomes of B-cell clones derived from the chimeric animal and compare said sequence to wild-type sequence to ascertain the level of hypermutation, such hypermutation indicative of normal antibody maturation.</p>
<p id="p-0300" num="0464">One skilled in the art would also use said chimeric animal to examine antibody function wherein said antibodies are encoded from the engineered Ig loci (see e.g. Harlow, E. &#x26; Lane, D. 1998, 5th edition, Antibodies: A Laboratory Manual, Cold Spring Harbor Lab. Press, Plainview, N.Y.). For example, antisera could be tested for binding an antigen, said antigen used to immunize the chimeric animal. Such a measurement could be made by an ELISA assay. Alternatively, one skilled in the art could test for neutralization of the antigen by addition of the antisera collected from the appropriately immunized chimeric animal.</p>
<p id="p-0301" num="0465">It is well known to those skilled in the art that positive outcomes for any of these tests demonstrate the ability of the engineered Ig loci, the subject of the instant invention, to encode antibodies with human variable regions and mouse constant regions, said antibodies capable of functioning in the manner of wild-type antibodies.</p>
<p id="p-0302" num="0466">Experimental Techniques: Recombineering for the production of vectors for use in homologous recombination in ES cells is disclosed in, for example, WO9929837 and WO0104288, and the techniques are well known in the art. In one aspect the recombineering of the human DNA takes place using BACs as a source of said human DNA. Human BAC DNA will be isolated using QIAGEN&#xae;, BAC purification kit. The backbone of each human BAC will be modified using recombineering to the exact same or similar configuration as the BAC already inserted into the mouse IgH region. The genomic insert of each human BAC will be trimmed using recombineering so that once the BACs are inserted, a seamless contiguous part of the human V(D)J genomic region will form at the mouse IgH or IgK locus. BAC DNA transfection by electroporation and genotyping will be performed accordingly to standard protocols (Prosser, H. M., Rzadzinska, A. K., Steel, K. P., and Bradley, A. (2008). &#x201c;Mosaic complementation demonstrates a regulatory role for myosin VIla in actin dynamics of stereocilia.&#x201d; Molecular and Cellular Biology 28, 1702-1712; Ramirez-Solis, R., Davis, A. C., and Bradley, A. (1993). &#x201c;Gene targeting in embryonic stem cells.&#x201d; Methods in Enzymology 225, 855-878.). Recombineering will be performed using the procedures and reagents developed by Pentao Liu and Don Court's laboratories (Chan, W., Costantino, N., Li, R., Lee, S. C., Su, Q., Melvin, D., Court, D. L., and Liu, P. (2007). &#x201c;A recombineering based approach for high-throughput conditional knockout targeting vector construction.&#x201d; Nucleic Acids Research 35, e64).</p>
<p id="p-0303" num="0467">These and other techniques for gene targeting and recombination of BAC-derived chromosomal fragments into a non-human mammal genome, such as a mouse are well-known in the art and are disclosed in, for example, in World Wide Web (www) eucomm.org/information/targeting and World Wide Web (www) eucomm.org/information/publications.</p>
<p id="p-0304" num="0468">Cell culture of C57BL/6N-derived cell lines, such as the JM8 male ES cells will follow standard techniques. The JM8 ES cells have been shown to be competent in extensively contributing to somatic tissues and to the germline, and are being used for large mouse mutagenesis programs at the Sanger Institute such as EUCOMM and KOMP (Pettitt, S. J., Liang, Q., Rairdan, X. Y., Moran, J. L., Prosser, H. M., Beier, D. R., Lloyd, K. C., Bradley, A., and Skarnes, W. C. (2009). &#x201c;Agouti C57BL/6N embryonic stem cells for mouse genetic resources.&#x201d; Nature Methods.). JM8 ES cells (1.0&#xd7;10<sup>7</sup>) will be electroporated (500 &#x3bc;F, 230V; Bio-Rad&#xae;) with 10 &#x3bc;g I-SceI linearized human BAC DNA. The transfectants will be selected with either Puromycin (3 &#x3bc;g/ml) or G418 (150 &#x3bc;g/ml). The selection will begin either 24 hours (with G418) or 48 hours (with Puromycin) post electroporation and proceed for 5 days. 10 &#x3bc;g linearized human BAC DNA can yield up to 500 Puromycin or G418 resistant ES cell colonies. The antibiotic resistant ES cell colonies will be picked into 96-well cell culture plates for genotyping to identify the targeted clones.</p>
<p id="p-0305" num="0469">Once targeted mouse ES cell clones are identified, they will be analyzed by array Comparative Genomic Hybridization (CGH) for total genome integrity (Chung, Y. J., Jonkers, J., Kitson, H., Fiegler, H., Humphray, S., Scott, C., Hunt, S., Yu, Y., Nishijima, I., Velds, A., et al. (2004). &#x201c;A whole-genome mouse BAC microarray with 1-Mb resolution for analysis of DNA copy number changes by array comparative genomic hybridization.&#x201d; Genome research 14, 188-196. and Liang, Q., Conte, N., Skarnes, W. C., and Bradley, A. (2008). &#x201c;Extensive genomic copy number variation in embryonic stem cells.&#x201d; Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America 105, 17453-17456.). ES cells that have abnormal genomes do not contribute to the germline of the chimeric mice efficiently. BAC integrity will be examined by PCR-amplifying each known functional V gene in the BAC. For example, in one approach the first human BAC chosen for the IgH locus has 6 functional V genes. To confirm the integrity of this BAC for the presence of these 6 IGH V genes, at least 14 pairs of PCR primers will be designed and used to PCR-amplify genomic DNA from the targeted ES cells. The human wild-type size and sequence of these fragments will ensure that the inserted BAC has not been rearranged.</p>
<p id="p-0306" num="0470">More detailed CGH will also confirm the integrity of the inserted BACs. For example, one skilled in the art could use an oligo aCGH platform, which is developed by Agilent Technologies, Inc. This platform not only enables one to study genome-wide DNA copy number variation at high resolution (Barrett, M. T., Scheffer, A., Ben-Dor, A., Sampas, N., Lipson, D., Kincaid, R., Tsang, P., Curry, B., Baird, K., Meltzer, P. S., et al. (2004). &#x201c;Comparative genomic hybridization using oligonucleotide microarrays and total genomic DNA.&#x201d; Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America 101, 17765-17770.), but permit examination of a specific genome region using custom designed arrays. Comparing the traditional aCGH techniques which rely on cDNA probes or whole BAC probes, the 60-mer oligonucleotides probes can ensure specific hybridization and high sensitivity and precision that is needed in order to detect the engineered chromosome alterations that were made. For example, oligos designed to hybridize at regular intervals along the entire length of the inserted BAC would detect even quite short deletions, insertions or other rearrangements. Also, this platform provides the greatest flexibility for customized microarray designs. The targeted ES cell genomic DNA and normal human individual genomic DNA will be labelled separately with dyes and hybridized to the array. Arrays slides will be scanned using an Aglient Technologies DNA microarray scanner. Reciprocal fluorescence intensities of dye Cy5 and dye Cy3 on each array image and the log 2 ratio values will be extracted by using Bluefuse software (Bluegnome). Spots with inconsistent fluorescence patterns (&#x201c;confidence&#x201d;&#x3c;0.29 or &#x201c;quality&#x201d;=0) will be excluded before normalizing all log 2 ratio values. Within an experiment, Log 2 ratio between &#x2212;0.29 and +0.29 for the signal from any oligo probe are regarded as no copy number change. The log 2 ratio threshold for &#x201c;Duplication&#x201d; is usually &#x3e;0.29999, and for deletion is &#x3c;0.29999.</p>
<p id="p-0307" num="0471">Once the first human BAC is inserted into the mouse IgH locus and confirmed to be in its intact, native configuration, the FRT-flanked BAC backbone will be excised by using Flp site-specific recombinase. If regular Flp-catalyzed FRT recombination is not high enough, one can use Flo, an improved version of Flpo recombinase which in certain tests is 3-4 times more efficient than the original Flp in ES cells. After the BAC backbone is excised, ES cells will become sensitive to Puromycin (or G418) and resistant to FIAU (for loss of the TK cassette). The excision events will be further characterized by PCR amplification of the junction fragment using human genomic DNA primers. These FRT-flanked BAC backbone-free ES cells will be used for the next round of human BAC insertion and for blastocyst injection.</p>
<p id="p-0308" num="0472">Targeting of the genome of an ES cell to produce a transgenic mouse may be carried out using a protocol as explained by reference to the attached <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>1</b>-<b>18</b></figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0309" num="0473"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref> illustrates three basic backbone vectors; an initiating cassette and 2 large insert vectors 1 and 2 respectively. The initiating cassette comprises sequences homologous to the desired site of insertion into the mouse genome, those sites flanking a selectable marker and stuffer primer sequence for PCR based genotyping to confirm correct insertion of BACs. The Stuffer-primer sequence provides the basis for genotyping each BAC addition step. This sequence is considered to provide a robust well validated sequence template for PCR primer and may be located at the IScel site, ideally &#x2dc;1 kb from the BAC insert.</p>
<p id="p-0310" num="0474">The large insert vectors comprise human DNA on plasmids with selectable markers and a unique restriction site for linearisation of the plasmid to aid in homologous recombination into the genome of the ES cell.</p>
<p id="p-0311" num="0475"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref> illustrates insertion of an initiating cassette into the mouse genome by Homologous recombination between the mouse J4 and C alpha exons. Puromycin selection allows identification of ES cells with insertion of the cassette. pu(Delta)tk is a bifunctional fusion protein between puromycin N-acetyltransferase (Puro) and a truncated version of herpes simplex virus type 1 thymidine kinase (DeltaTk). Murine embryonic stem (ES) cells transfected with pu(Delta)tk become resistant to puromycin and sensitive 1-(-2-deoxy-2-fluoro-1-beta-D-arabino-furanosyl)-5-iodouracil (FIAU). Unlike other HSV1 tk transgenes, puDeltatk is readily transmitted through the male germ line. Thus pu(Delta)tk is a convenient positive/negative selectable marker that can be widely used in many ES cell applications.</p>
<p id="p-0312" num="0476"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref> illustrates targeting of the large insert vector 1 to the mouse ES cell genome. Linearisation of the vector is made at the same position as the stuffer primer sequence which allows for a gap repair genotyping strategy, well known in the art&#x2014;see Zheng et al NAR 1999, Vol 27, 11, 2354-2360. In essence, random insertion of the targeting vector into the genome will not &#x2018;repair&#x2019; the gap whereas a homologous recombination event will repair the gap. Juxtaposition of appropriate PCR primer sequences allows colonies to be screened individually for a positive PCR fragment indicating proper insertion. Positive selection using G418 allows for identification of mouse ES cells containing the neo selection marker. PCR verification can be made of all critical V, D and J regions. Array comparative genomic hybridization can be used to validate the BAC structure.</p>
<p id="p-0313" num="0477"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b></figref> illustrates the puro-delta-tk cassette and the BAC plasmid backbone is deleted using Flpe and select in FIAU. Since Flpe works inefficiently in mouse ES cells (5% deletion with transient Flpe expression), it is expected that in most cases, the recombination occurs between the two FRT sites flanking the BAC backbone. Flpo can also be tested to find out the recombination efficiency between two FRT sites that are 10 kb away.</p>
<p id="p-0314" num="0478">Given that the FRT deletion step is selectable it is possible to pool FIAU resistant clones and proceed immediately to the next step in parallel with clonal analysis. Alternatively it may be desirable to show by short range PCR that the human sequences are now adjacent to those of the mouse as shown (Hu-primer 1 and Mo-primer)</p>
<p id="p-0315" num="0479">At this stage a 200 kb human locus will have been inserted.</p>

The human BAC is targeted to the mouse IgH locus using the same initiation cassette insertion followed by IScel BAC linearization, BAC targeting to the initiation cassette and gap-repair genotyping strategy. Verification of the BAC insertion is carried out as before.</p>

<p id="p-0322" num="0486">In a further method of the invention site specific recombination can also be employed. Site-specific recombination (SSR) has been widely used in the last 20-years for the integration of transgenes into defined chromosomal loci. SSR involves recombination between homologous DNA sequences.</p>
<p id="p-0323" num="0487">The first generation of SSR-based chromosomal targeting involved recombination between (i) a single recombination target site (RT) such as loxP or FRT in a transfected plasmid with (ii) a chromosomal RT site provided by a previous integration. A major problem with this approach is that insertion events are rare since excision is always more efficient than insertion. A second generation of SSR called RMCE (recombinase-mediated cassette exchange) was introduced by Schlake and Bode in 1994 (Schlake, T.; J. Bode (1994). &#x201c;Use of mutated FLP-recognition-target-(FRT-)sites for the exchange of expression cassettes at defined chromosomal loci&#x201d;. Biochemistry 33: 12746-12751). Their method is based on using two heterospecific and incompatible RTs in the transfected plasmid which can recombine with compatible RT sites on the chromosome resulting in the swap of one piece of DNA for another&#x2014;or a cassette exchange. This approach has been successfully exploited in a variety of efficient chromosomal targeting, including integration of BAC inserts of greater than 50 kb (Wallace, H. A. C. et al. (2007). &#x201c;Manipulating the mouse genome to engineering precise functional syntenic replacements with human sequence&#x201d;. Cell 128: 197-209; Prosser, H. M. et al. (2008). &#x201c;Mosaic complementation demonstrates a regulatory role for myosin VIIa in actin dynamics of Stereocilia&#x201d;. Mol. Cell. Biol. 28: 1702-12).</p>
<p id="p-0324" num="0488">The largest insert size of a BAC is about 300-kb and therefore this places an upper limit on cassette size for RMCE.</p>
<p id="p-0325" num="0489">In the present invention a new SSR-based technique called sequential RMCE (SRMCE) was used, which allows continuous insertion of BAC inserts into the same locus.</p>

        <li id="ul0066-0001" num="0498">1. Targeting a landing pad into the defined locus. An entry vector containing an HPRT mini-gene flanked by inverted piggyBac (PB) ITRs is targeted into defined region (for example: a region between IGHJ and E&#x3bc; or IGKJ and E&#x3ba; or IGLC1 and E&#x3bb;3-1) to serve as a landing pad for BAC targeting. The HPRT mini-gene is comprised of two synthetic exons and associated intron. The 5&#x2032; HPRT exon is flanked by two heterospecific and incompatible loxP sites (one wild-type and the other a mutated site, lox5171) in inverted orientation to each other (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>22</b></figref>).

With transient CRE expression from a co-electroporated vector, the DNA sequence would be inserted into the defined locus through RMCE. The cells in which a correct insertion has occurred can be selected as follows: (i) Puromycin-resistance (the puro&#x394;TK gene has acquired a promoter&#x2014;&#x201c;PGK&#x201d;&#x2014;from the landing pad), (ii) 6TG-resistance (the HPRT mini-gene has been disrupted), and (iii) G418-resistance (selects for any insertion via the 5&#x2032; region PGK-neo arrangement). Any combination of these selection regimes can be used.

The loxP sites are inverted relative to one another and therefore the described recombination event results in an inversion as depicted in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>28</b></figref>.

Cells with the correct excisions can be selected as follows: (i) 6TG-resistance (the HPRT mini-gene is deleted) and (ii) FIAU-resistance (the puro&#x394;TK gene is deleted). An inversion as described in the Ig loci would move the endogenous IGH-VDJ or IGK-VJ region away from the E&#x3bc; or E&#x3ba; enhancer region, respectively, and lead to inactivation of the endogenous IGH-VDJ or IGK-VJ regions.</li>

<p id="p-0330" num="0513">Insertion of a Test Vector into the Genome at a Defined Location</p>
<p id="p-0331" num="0514">Proof of concept of the approach is disclosed in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>30</b></figref>. In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>30</b></figref> a landing pad as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>22</b></figref> was inserted into the genome of a mouse by homologous recombination, followed by insertion of the R21 plasmid into that landing pad via cre-mediated site specific recombination. The insertion event generated a number of general insertion events, 360 G418 resistant colonies, of which &#x2dc;220 were inserted into the desired locus, as demonstrated by disruption of the HRPT minilocus.</p>
<p id="p-0332" num="0515">The R21 vector mimicks the 1<sup>st </sup>BAC insertion vector at the 5&#x2032; and 3&#x2032; ends, including all selection elements and recombinase target sites. In place of BAC sequences, there is a small &#x2018;stuffer&#x2019; sequence. This vector will both test all the principals designed in the invention and allow easy testing of the results in that PCR across the stuffer is feasible and therefore allows both ends of the insertion to be easily tested. R21 was co-electroporated with a cre-expressing vector into the ES cells harbouring the landing pad in the IGH locus. Four sets of transformed cells were transfected in parallel and then placed under different selection regimes as indicated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>30</b></figref>. G418 selection (neo gene expression) resulted in the largest number of colonies due to there being no requirement for specific landing-pad integration. Any integration of R21 into the genome will provide neo expression leading to G418-resistance. Puro selection resulted in a similar colony number to Puro+6TG or G418+6TG, suggesting that the stringency of Puro selection is due to the Puro&#x394;TK lacking a promoter in the vector. Puro expression is only acquired when an integration occurs near a promoter element&#x2014;in this design most likely specifically in the landing pad. These conclusions are supported by the results from junction PCR which is shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>31</b></figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0333" num="0516">The next step in the invention is to &#x2018;cure&#x2019; the 3&#x2032; end of the integrated BAC vector, leaving a seamless transition between the insertion and the flanking genome. This curing was demonstrated by expanding an individual clone from above (R21 inserted into the landing pad) and expressing piggyBac recombinase in this clone via transfection of an expressing plasmid. FIAU was used to select colonies in which the 3&#x2032; modification was excised&#x2014;ie, through loss of the &#x2018;PGK-puro&#x394;TK&#x2019; element between the piggyBac terminal repeats. Fifty such clones resulted from a transfection of 10<sup>6 </sup>cells; of these six were tested for the expected genomic structure. Successful curing resulted in positive PCR between the primer set labelled &#x201c;3&#x201d; in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>32</b></figref>. Of the 6 clones, 4 had correct excisions, 1 clone remained in the original configuration and 1 other had a deletion.</p>
<p id="p-0334" num="0517">These data demonstrate iterative insertion of DNA into a landing pad at a defined genomic locus using the approaches outlined above.</p>

<p id="p-0335" num="0518">Insertion of Large Parts of the Human IG Loci into Defined Positions in the Mouse Genome</p>
<p id="p-0336" num="0519">Example 3 demonstrated that the design of the claimed invention was capable of providing for the insertion of a test vector into the genome at a defined location, in this case the R21 vector into the mouse IGH locus. The use of the appropriate selection media and the expression of cre-recombinase resulted in a genomic alteration with the predicted structure.</p>
<p id="p-0337" num="0520">The same design elements described in this invention were built into the 5&#x2032; and 3&#x2032; ends of a BAC insert. Said insert comprised human sequences from the IGH locus and was approximately 166-kb. This engineered BAC was electroporated along with a cre-expressing plasmid DNA into mouse ES cells harbouring the landing pad at the mouse IGH locus. The transfected cell population was grown in puro-containing media to select for appropriate insertion events.</p>
<p id="p-0338" num="0521">Seven resulting clones were isolated and further analysed. The expected recombination event and resulting structure are depicted in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>33</b></figref>. Based upon data from the R21 experiment outlined in Example 3, a stringent selection for correct clones was expected when the transfected population was selected in puro-containing media. This is because the puro-coding region requires a promoter element and this is preferentially supplied by the landing pad after recombination. Accordingly, the majority of the 7 isolated clones had inserted correctly into the genome at the landing pad as determined by the diagnostic PCR. The primers for diagnosing a correct insertion are depicted in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>33</b></figref>. Correct junctions are present in the genome if a 610-bp fragment is amplified between primers &#x2018;A&#x2019; and &#x2018;X&#x2019; and a 478-bp fragment is amplified between primers &#x2018;Y&#x2019; and &#x2018;B&#x2019; (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>33</b> and <b>34</b></figref>). Note that there are amplified fragments between &#x2018;A&#x2019; and &#x2018;1&#x2019; primers and &#x2018;2&#x2019; and &#x2018;B&#x2019; primers indicating the presence of parental genome (that is, the landing pad alone). These result from parental cells present internally in the cell colonies under puro-selection that escape the selection due to the geometry of a colony. After passaging the colony through puro-containing media, these parental junction fragments disappear indicating that the parental cells are removed from the population. In addition, all the clones were shown to be resistant to 6-TG as expected if the HPRT gene is inactivated by the correct insertion event.</p>
<p id="p-0339" num="0522">These data indicate that the disclosed strategy for inserting large parts of the human IG loci into defined positions in the mouse genome will enable the construction of a mouse with a plurality of the variable regions of human IG regions upstream of the mouse constant regions as described.</p>

<p id="p-0340" num="0523">Bacterial artificial chromosomes (BACs) were created, wherein the BACs had inserts of human Ig gene segments (human V, D and/or J gene segments). Using methods described herein, landing pads were used in a method to construct chimaeric Ig loci in mouse embryonic stem cells (ES cells), such that chimaeric IgH and IgK loci were provided in which human gene segments are functionally inserted upstream of endogenous constant regions. To test if the human IgH-VDJ or IgK-VJ gene segments in the chimaera mice derived from human BAC-inserted ES cell clones appropriately rearrange and express, RT-PCR was performed for the RNA samples of white blood cells from those mice with the primer pairs of human variable (V) region and mouse constant (C) region. The sequences of oligos are shown as follows (Table 1). Each V oligo is paired with C oligo (HV with C&#x3bc;; KV with C&#x3ba;) for PCR reaction.</p>

<heading id="h-0030" level="2">Inactivation of Use of Endogenous IGHV Gene Segments for Expressed Rearranged Heavy Chain by Inversion</heading>
<heading id="h-0031" level="2">Introduction</heading>
<p id="p-0346" num="0528">A 5&#x2032;-RACE C&#x3bc;-specific library was generated from the splenic B lymphocytes of transgenic mice, denoted S1 mice. These mice comprise transgenic heavy chain loci, each locus containing the six most 3&#x2032; functional human V<sub>H </sub>gene segments (V<sub>H</sub>2-5, 7-4-1, 4-4, 1-3, 1-2, 6-1), and all the human D and J<sub>H </sub>gene segments inserted into the endogenous heavy chain locus between endogenous IGHJ4 and E&#x3bc; (mouse chromosome 12: between coordinates 114666435 and 114666436). The human DNA was obtained from a bacterial artificial chromosome (BAC) containing the sequence of human chromosome 14 from coordinate 106328951 to coordinate 106494908. Further details on the construction of transgenic antibody loci using sRMCE is given elsewhere herein and in WO2011004192 (which is incorporated herein by reference). 4&#xd7;96-well plates of clones were randomly picked for sequencing to determine the usage of the gene segments. All detected immunoglobulin heavy chains were rearranged from mouse V<sub>H </sub>or human V<sub>H </sub>with human D-J<sub>H</sub>. No mouse D and J<sub>H </sub>segments were detected in rearranged products (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>44</b></figref>).</p>
<p id="p-0347" num="0529">This result indicates that insertion of human V<sub>H</sub>-D-J<sub>H </sub>gene segments into an endogenous locus between the last endogenous J region (in this case, J<sub>H</sub>4) and the E&#x3bc; enhancer effectively inactivates the use of endogenous D and J<sub>H </sub>gene segments for expressed rearranged immunoglobulin heavy chains.</p>
<p id="p-0348" num="0530">The ratio of mouse V<sub>H </sub>to human V<sub>H </sub>usage was around 3 to 1 (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>45</b></figref>). To completely eliminate mouse V<sub>H </sub>use for antibody generation, the endogenous mouse V<sub>H</sub>-D-J<sub>H </sub>was inverted and moved to a distant region of the same chromosome. The rearrangement of mouse V<sub>H</sub>s to human D-J<sub>H </sub>segments was totally blocked by effects of inversion and distance from the heavy chain locus.</p>
<p id="p-0349" num="0531">The inversion strategy included three steps: (a) targeting of an inversion cassette, (b) inversion of endogenous VDJ and (c) excision of markers (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>46</b></figref>).</p>
<p id="p-0350" num="0532">(a) Targeting of the Inversion Cassette:</p>
<p id="p-0351" num="0533">The inversion cassette consists of four components: a CAGGS promoter-driven puromycin-resistant-delta-thymidine kinase (puro&#x394;tk) gene, a 5&#x2032; HPRT gene segment under the PGK promoter control, a loxP site between them and inversely oriented to another loxP site already in the heavy chain locus, and two flanking piggyback LTRs (PB3&#x2032;LTRs). The inversion targeting cassette was inserted to a region that is 5&#x2032; and distant to the endogenous IGH locus at chromosome 12 as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>46</b></figref>. The targeted ES clones were identified and confirmed by PCR.</p>
<p id="p-0352" num="0534">(b) Inversion:</p>
<p id="p-0353" num="0535">Following the insertion, transient expression of cre from a transfected plasmid resulted in inversion of a section of chromosome 12 fragment including the endogenous V<sub>H</sub>-D-J<sub>H </sub>locus and intervening sequences through recombination of two inverted loxP sites, ie, those in the inversion cassette and the landing pad for the BAC insertion respectively. The invertants were selected by HAT and confirmed by junction PCRs cross the two recombined loxP sites.</p>
<p id="p-0354" num="0536">(c) Excision of Markers:</p>
<p id="p-0355" num="0537">The inversion rearranged the relative orientation of the PB3&#x2032;LTRs from the inversion cassette and PB5&#x2032;LTR from the landing pad to generate two piggyBac transposon structures flanking the inverted region. With transient expression of piggyBac transposase (PBase), these two transposons were excised from the chromosome (and thus the mouse cell genome). The cured ES clones were selected by 1-(-2-deoxy-2-fluoro-1-b-D-arabinofuranosyl)-5-iodouracil (FIAU) and 6TG, and confirmed by junction PCRs cross the excised regions.</p>
<heading id="h-0032" level="2">Methods</heading>
<p id="p-0356" num="0538">Tissue culture: The procedures for ES cell culture, electroporation and drug selection have been described previously (Ramirez-Solis, R., A. C. Davis, and A. Bradley. 1993. Gene targeting in mouse embryonic stem cells. Methods Enzymol. 225:855-878).</p>
<p id="p-0357" num="0539">Targeting of the locus for inversion: Briefly, 51 cell line (S1.11.1) was cultured in M15 medium (Knockout&#x2122; DMEM supplemented with 15% fetal bovine serum, 2 mM glutamine, antibiotics, and 0.1 mM 2-mercaptoethonal). Targeting construct R57 (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>47</b></figref>) was linearized outside the region of homology by NotI. A total of 20 &#x3bc;g of the linearized construct was electroporated into 51 cell lines (AB2.1-derived) with a Bio-Rad&#xae; Gene Pulser&#x2122;, and 107 cells were plated onto three 90-mm-diameter SNL76/7 feeder plates containing M15 medium. At 24 h after electroporation, M15 containing puromycin (3 &#x3bc;g of the active ingredient per ml) was added to each 90-mm-diameter plate, and the cells were maintained under selection for 9 days. 96 puromycin-resistant clones were then picked and expanded in 96-well plates. The targeting events were identified by long-range PCR.</p>
<p id="p-0358" num="0540">Cre-loxP mediated inversion: 12 positive clones were pooled together and cultured in a 6-well tissue culture plate with M15 medium. The cells were transfected with 10 &#x3bc;g of pCAGGS-Cre plasmid for the inversion of mouse endogenous locus and then plated onto three 90-mm-diameter SNL76/7 feeder plates containing M15 medium. At 24 h after electroporation, M15 containing 1&#xd7;HAT (hypoxanthine-aminopterin-thymidine) was added to each 90-mm-diameter plate, and the cells were maintained under selection for 7 days and then treated with 1&#xd7;HT (hypoxanthine-thymidine) for 2 days. 48 HAT resistant colonies were picked and genotyped by PCR amplification of the junctions after Cre-loxP mediated inversion.</p>
<p id="p-0359" num="0541">HyPBase-mediated marker excision: 12 positive clones were pooled together and cultured in 6-well tissue culture plate using M15 medium. The cells were transfected with 5 &#x3bc;g of HyPBase plasmid to activate the PB transposon LTRs flanking two selection markers (Hprt-mini gene and PGK-puro&#x394;tk gene) and plated onto one 90-mm-diameter SNL76/7 feeder plates containing M15 medium. At 72 h after electroporation, a serial dilution of the cells was then plated onto three 90-mm-diameter SNL76/7 feeder plates containing M15 supplemented with 1-(-2-deoxy-2-fluoro-1-b-D-arabinofuranosyl)-5-iodouracil (FIAU). Cells were maintained under selection for 10 days, and FIAU-resistant colonies were counted, picked, and expanded in 96-well plates. Positive clones were identified by PCR amplification of the junctions after excision of the selection markers. Positive clones were then expanded for blastocyst microinjection.</p>
<p id="p-0360" num="0542">Generation of chimera and breeding: Mouse chimaeras were generated by microinjection of ES cells into C57/BL6 blastocysts and transferred into pseudopregnant recipients. Male chimaeras were test-crossed with C57/BL6 mice. Agouti F1 offspring were genotyped by S1 3&#x2032; junction PCR. Test-cross positive heterozygotes were further intercrossed to generate homozygotes.</p>
<p id="p-0361" num="0543">Determination of VH-D-JH usage by rapid amplification of 5&#x2032;-cDNA ends (5&#x2032; RACE) PCR: Total RNA was extracted from the spleen of S1inv1 mouse (KMSF30.1d) with TRIzol&#xae; Reagent (Invitrogen&#x2122;, Life Technologies Ltd&#x2122;) and treated with DNase I. Rapid amplification of 5&#x2032;-cDNA ends (5&#x2032; RACE) PCR was performed using 573&#x2032; RACE kit (2nd Generation, Roche) following the protocol supplied by the manufacturer. The first-strand cDNA was synthesised using primer E1554 (5&#x2032;-ATGACTTCAGTGTTGTTCTGGTAG-3&#x2032;; SEQ ID No 25) which is located at the mouse endogenous Cp region. The synthesised first cDNA strand was purified using High Pure PCR Product Purification Kit (Roche). Poly(A) tail was added following the protocol supplied with the 573&#x2032; RACE kit (2nd Generation, Roche). The 5&#x2032; end of the V<sub>H</sub>-D-J<sub>H </sub>rearranged transcript was amplified by nested PCR with forward primers Oligo dT, which is included in the kit, and nested Cp-specific reverse primers E1555 (5&#x2032;-CACCAGATTCTTATCAGAC-3&#x2032;; SEQ ID No 26). Following reaction, the 5&#x2032; RACE PCR product was checked on a 1% agarose gel and purified using QIAquick&#xae; Gel Extraction Kit (QIAGEN) as the protocol supplied with the kit, then cloned into pDrive vector using QIAGEN PCR Cloning Kit (QIAGEN) for sequencing analysis.</p>

Mouse V<sub>H </sub>usage was rarely detected (0.4%), and no mouse D and J<sub>H </sub>usage was detected. Human V<sub>H </sub>usage was 99.6% and only human D and J<sub>H </sub>were used; it was hypothesized that the rare mouse V<sub>H </sub>usage was due to trans-switching with another chromosome and not due to use of moue V<sub>H </sub>from the inverted sequences. The inversion resulted in complete inactivation of the endogenous V<sub>H </sub>use.</p>
<p id="p-0363" num="0545">This result indicates that inversion is an effective way to inactivate the rearrangement of endogenous V<sub>H </sub>gene segments.

Thus, a mouse was produced that comprises a transgenic heavy chain locus that expresses heavy chains comprising human variable regions, but no mouse variable regions, and furthermore the human variable regions demonstrated a normal, human sequence distribution corresponding to human D and J usage observed in humans.</p>

<p id="p-0364" num="0546">Insertion of human BACs with V<sub>H</sub>-D-J<sub>H </sub>gene segments into an endogenous mouse heavy chain locus between J<sub>H</sub>4 and E&#x3bc; in chromosome 12 allows human V<sub>H</sub>-D-J<sub>H </sub>gene segments to effectively use mouse E&#x3bc; and 3&#x2032; enhancers and rearrange to generate chimeric antibody with human variable region and mouse constant region. Meanwhile, the endogenous V<sub>H</sub>-D-J<sub>H </sub>gene segments are pushed away from endogenous enhancers and constant regions. This distance effect results in inactivation of mouse D and J<sub>H </sub>use for expressed rearranged antibody products. As the distance increases by stepwise BAC insertion, it is expected that the mouse VH usage would be significantly reduced.</p>

<heading id="h-0040" level="2">Introduction</heading>
<p id="p-0368" num="0550">The B cell arm of the immune system has evolved to produce high affinity, antigen-specific antibodies in response to antigenic challenge. Antibodies are generated in B lymphocytes by a process of gene rearrangement in which variable (V), diversity (D; for the IGH locus) and joining (J) gene segments are recombined, transcribed and spliced to a C&#x3bc; (for IGH) or a C&#x3ba; or C&#x3bb; (for IGL) constant region gene segment to form an IgM antibody. Depending on the stage of B cell development, IgM is either located on the cell surface or secreted. The recombination process generates a primary antibody repertoire with sufficient germ line diversity to bind a wide range of antigens. However, it is usually not large enough to provide the high affinity antibodies that are required for an effective immune response to an antigen such as an infectious agent. Therefore, the immune system adopts a two-stage diversification process to increase diversity further. When challenged with antigens, B cells undergo selection and maturation by a process called somatic mutation. B cells expressing antibodies which bind to antigen undergo multiple rounds of diversification, clonal expansion and antigen selection in the germinal centres (GCs) of the secondary lymphoid organs. During this process, the rearranged variable regions of the immunoglobulin genes acquire somatic hypermutation through nucleotide substitution, addition or deletion. This stepwise process creates a secondary repertoire from the weak binders selected originally from the primary repertoire and combines rapid proliferation of antigen-reactive B cells with intense selection for quality of binding, eventually giving rise to high affinity antibodies with broad epitope coverage. During this process, antibodies undergo class switching in which the C&#x3bc; constant region is replaced by C&#x3b3;, C&#x3b1; or C&#x3b5; to produce respectively IgG, A or E classes of antibody with different effector functions.</p>
<p id="p-0369" num="0551">Insertion of 1st human BAC (Chr14: 106328951-106494908) containing six most 3&#x2032; functional V<sub>H </sub>gene segments (V<sub>H</sub>2-5, 7-4-1, 4-4, 1-3, 1-2, 6-1), and all the D and J<sub>H </sub>gene segments into the locus between endogenous IGHJ4 and E&#x3bc; (Chr12: 114666435 and 114666436) produces transgenic mice that generate chimeric immunoglobulin heavy chains containing human variable and mouse constant regions. This result demonstrates that human immunoglobulin gene segments are able to be rearranged and expressed in mice. Here, RT-PCR experiments and sequence analysis were performed to further demonstrate that immunized transgenic mice have proper class switch and hypermutation for generated antibodies.</p>

<heading id="h-0045" level="2">Introduction</heading>
<p id="p-0373" num="0554">In mice, about 2&#xd7;10<sup>7 </sup>bone marrow immature B cells are produced daily. Among them, only 10-20% of these cells survive to exit the bone marrow and enter the spleen. The immature splenic B cell population is divided into two distinct subsets: transitional 1 (T1) and transitional 2 (T2) B cells. In vivo experiments indicate that T1 cells give rise to T2 cells, whereas T2 cells can further differentiate into mature (M) B cells. In contrast to immature B cells (3-4 days old), mature B cells are long-lived (15-20 weeks old) and are ready to respond to antigens (Pillai S et al; Immunol. Reviews. 2004. 197: 206-218). Thus, the component of mature B cell population is directly linked to the efficiency of humoral immune response.</p>

<p id="p-0380" num="0565">Transgenic mice (H1) carrying all human JH, all human DH and human Vh2-5 under control of a rat switch region or mice (S1) carrying all human JH, all human DH and human Vh2-5, Vh7-41, Vh4-4, Vh1-3, Vh1-2 and Vh6-1 under control of a mouse switch region were immunised with 100 &#x3bc;g Cholera Toxin B subunit (CTB; Sigma-Aldrich&#xae; C9903) emulsified in Complete Freund's Adjuvant CFA; Sigma-Aldrich&#xae; F 5881). At least three animals were injected sc or ip and then boosted with 25 &#x3bc;g antigen in Incomplete Freund's Adjuvant (IFA; Sigma-Aldrich&#xae; F 5506) at (i) 14 days and 21 days or (ii) 28 days after priming. Blood was taken before priming at day &#x201c;&#x2212;1&#x201d; (pre-bleeds) and on the day the spleens were taken (usually 4 d after last boost). Serum was analysed by ELISA using an antigen independent assessment of Ig isotypes. This assay detects total serum antibodies of all species. Specific detection for mouse IgG1, IgG2a, IgG2b and IgM was used ((Anti-mouse IgG1 HRP AbD Serotec STAR132P, Anti-mouse IgG2a HRP AbD Serotec STAR133P, Anti-mouse IgG2b HRP AbD Serotec STAR134P, Anti-mouse IgM HRP Abcam&#xae; ab97230) and concentrations were read off a standard curve produced for each isotype using polyclonal isotype controls (IgG1, Kappa murine myeloma Sigma-Aldrich&#xae; M9269, IgG2a, Kappa murine myeloma Sigma-Aldrich&#xae; M9144, IgG2b, Kappa from murine myeloma Sigma-Aldrich&#xae; M8894, IgM, Kappa from murine myeloma Sigma-Aldrich&#xae; M3795). Results (FIGS. 54 &#x26; 55 for H1 homozygous and S1 homozygous and heterozygous mice) showed that even with these relatively short immunisation regimes mice showed an increase in overall IgG levels after immunisation over pre-bleeds. In cases where control mice (+/+) not carrying any human immunoglobulin genes were included and immunised, these mice showed comparable changes in total observed Ig levels (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>54</b></figref>). Individual isotype levels were more variable between animals possibly showing various stages of class switching. IgM levels never exceeded 800 &#x3bc;g/ml whereas IgG levels reached more than 6 mg/ml in some animals. Non-immunised controls showed no such increases in switched isotype Ig levels.</p>
<p id="p-0381" num="0566">These results demonstrate that mice comprising multiple human VDJ gene segments under the control of a rat Sp rat or mouse switch are able to undergo productive recombination and class switching in response to antigen challenge and that the mice produce antibody levels that are broadly comparable to unmodified mice The transgenic mice are able to produce antibodies of each of the IgG1, IgG2a, IgG2b and IgM isotypes after immunisation. Titers for CTB-specific Ig in pre-bleeds and terminal bleeds were determined and all immunised animals showed at CTB-specific titres of at least 1/100 000.</p>

<p id="p-0383" num="0568">Transgenic mice carrying all human JH, all human DH and human Vh2-5 under control of a rat Sp switch region were immunised with 25 &#x3bc;g ovalbumin (OVA; Sigma-Aldrich&#xae; A7641) in Sigma-Aldrich&#xae; adjuvant (Sigma Adjuvant System&#xae; S6322) ip and then boosted with the same amount of OVA in adjuvant at day 14 and day 21. Spleenocytes were taken 4 days later and fused using 1 ml polyethyleneglycol (PEG Average MW1450; Sigma-Aldrich&#xae; P7306) with a myeloma line. Fused hybridoma cells were plated on 5 96-well plates and after selection with hypoxanthine-aminopterin-thymidine (HAT) wells tested for expression of OVA-specific antibodies by ELISA. Clones positive by ELISA were re-tested by surface plasmon resonance (SPR) and binding kinetics determined using the ProteOn&#x2122; XPR36 (Bio-Rad&#xae;). Briefly, anti-mouse IgG (GE Biacore&#x2122; BR-1008-38) was coupled to a GLM biosensor chip by primary amine coupling, this was used to capture the antibodies to be tested directly from tissue culture supernatants.</p>
<p id="p-0384" num="0569">Ovalbumin was used as the analyte and passed over the captured antibody surface at 1024 nM, 256 nM, 64 nM, 16 nM, 4 nM with a 0 nM (i.e. buffer alone) used to double reference the binding data. Regeneration of the anti-mouse IgG capture surface was by 10 mM glycine pH1.7, this removed the captured antibody and allowed the surface to be used for another interaction. The binding data was fitted to 1:1 model inherent to the ProteOn&#x2122; XPR36 analysis software. The run was carried out 1&#xd7;HBS-EP (10 mM Hepes, 150 mM NaCl, 3 mM EDTA, 0.05% polysorbate, pH7.6 (Teknova H8022)) used as running buffer and carried out at 25&#xb0; C.</p>

<p id="p-0391" num="0574">Transgenic mice carrying all human JH, all human DH and human Vh2-5, Vh7-41, Vh4-4, Vh1-3, Vh1-2 and Vh6-1 under control of a mouse Sp switch region were immunised and fused as described in Example 11. Fused hybridoma cells were plated on 5 96-well plates and after selection with hypoxanthine-aminopterin-thymidine (HAT) or G418 (Gibco&#xae; Cat No 10131-027, Lot 503317) and wells tested for expression of CTB-specific antibodies by ELISA. Clones positive by ELISA were re-tested by surface plasmon resonance SPR and binding kinetics determined using the ProteOn XPR36&#x2122; (Bio-Rad&#xae;).</p>
<p id="p-0392" num="0575">Briefly, anti-mouse IgG (GE Biacore&#x2122; BR-1008-38) was coupled to a GLM biosensor chip by primary amine coupling, this was used to capture the antibodies to be tested directly from tissue culture supernatants. Cholera toxin B was used as analyte and passed over the captured antibody surface at 256 nM, 64 nM, 16 nM, 4 nM and 1 nM, with a 0 nM (i.e. buffer alone) used to double reference the binding data.

<p id="p-0393" num="0576">From the clones initially identified by ELISA, binding to CTB was confirmed by SPR. However, due to the pentameric nature of the cholera toxin B, the majority of fits to the 1:1 model were poor and the equilibrium binding constant KDs could not be accurately determined. Where fits were acceptable, equilibrium binding constant KDs determined ranged from 0.21 nM to 309 nM but due to the pentameric nature of cholera toxin B these are likely to be the result of multimeric interactions and therefore apparent affinities with possible avidity components.</p>
<p id="p-0394" num="0577">Clones identified by SPR for binding to CTB were subjected to RT-PCR as described in Example 12 to recover the Vh regions. RT-PCR products were directly sequenced using the same primer pairs. Results were obtained for only 14 clones presumably because the human primers described in Wardemann et al were not designed to amplify mouse Vh regions and therefore may have failed to amplify certain mouse Vh classes. Results showed that 3 of the 14 CTB-specific recovered heavy chain V-region sequences were human V, D and J regions as identified by V-Quest, IMGT (Table 5).</p>
