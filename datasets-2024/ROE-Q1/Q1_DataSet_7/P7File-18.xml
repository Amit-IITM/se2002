<abstract id="abstract">
<p id="p-0001" num="0000">Various apparatuses to attach a first medical device to a second medical device are described that allow the physician to grasp only a single device while the other device remains securely attached to the one being grasped. The apparatuses, once they are attached to the first medical device, are designed to be easily and quickly attached and detached to a second medical device, normally only requiring the use of one hand. Furthermore, the apparatuses oftentimes include a base that can easily couple and decouple from the portion that is attached to the second medical device so that if the need arises to separately use the second medical device, it can be decoupled from the first medical device without completely removing the apparatus from the second medical device.</p>

<heading id="h-0001" level="1">CROSS-REFERENCE TO RELATED APPLICATION</heading>
<p id="p-0002" num="0001">This application claims the benefit of U.S. Provisional Application No. 60/888,713, filed on Feb. 7, 2007, incorporated herein expressly by reference.</p>
<?cross-reference-to-related-applications description="Cross Reference To Related Applications" end="tail"?>
<?summary-of-invention description="Summary of Invention" end="lead"?>
<heading id="h-0002" level="1">BACKGROUND</heading>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">More than one medical device is often required to be used together during the same medical procedure. For example, in the performance of minimally-invasive types of procedures using an endoscope, a second medical device is sometimes inserted through the working channel of the endoscope. Either the endoscope or the second medical device can provide illumination and imaging capability while the other may perform a distinct or specialized function. Having to hold two instruments is burdensome for the physician.</p>
<heading id="h-0003" level="1">SUMMARY</heading>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">Various apparatuses to attach a first medical device to a second medical device are described that allow the physician to grasp only a single device while the other device remains securely attached to the one being grasped. Embodiments of the apparatus may include one or more of the following devices or a type of holding portion including clamps, jaws, pincers, latches, toggle joints, hooks, straps, fasteners, buckles and the like that are modified for use in holding the second medical device securely onto the first medical device. Additionally or alternatively, any of the devices or holding portions can have surfaces covered by means to enhance the gripping strength between the holding portion and the medical device. For example, the clamps, jaws, pincers, latches, joints, hooks, straps, fasteners, and buckles can have surfaces that enhance gripping including a soft material, a sticky or tacky material such as a releasable adhesive, magnets, keyed features (i.e., components that fit within other slots or notches), VELCRO&#xae; enhancements at any surface, surface roughening, and/or additional material wrapped around the catheter. The apparatuses, once they are attached to the first medical device, are designed to be easily and quickly attached and detached to a second medical device, normally only requiring the use of one hand. Furthermore, the apparatuses oftentimes include a base attached to the first medical device that can easily couple and decouple from the portion that is attached to the second medical device so that if the second medical device needs to be operated by a different user, the second medical device can be decoupled from the first medical device without completely removing the apparatus from the second medical device.</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">While the apparatuses are described as being used with a first medical device and a second medical device, the apparatuses are thereby not limited solely to use in a medical setting. The description with reference to medical devices is done solely for the purpose of illustrating a representative use. The apparatuses herein disclosed may be used, for example, to hold any two tools to each other where the job or task requires that two tools be used. Such tools may include tools of a mechanic, plumber, electrician, or any other trade.</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">This summary is provided to introduce a selection of concepts in a simplified form, concepts that are further described below in the Detailed Description. This summary is not intended to identify key features of the claimed subject matter nor is it intended to be used as an aid in determining the scope of the claimed subject matter.</p>

<heading id="h-0005" level="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION</heading>
<p id="p-0024" num="0023">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b>A</figref>, a medical device <b>100</b> may include an apparatus <b>102</b> for attaching the first medical device to a second medical device (not shown). Medical device <b>100</b> and the second medical device that is not shown may be an endoscope, a catheter, a minimally invasive device, and the like. Medical devices preferably may have a circular cross-sectional configuration at least along some portion of their length.</p>
<p id="p-0025" num="0024">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b>B</figref>, the apparatus <b>102</b> may include a clamp <b>103</b> portion and a base <b>114</b> portion that attach to the medical device <b>100</b>, The clamp base <b>114</b> may attach to the medical device <b>100</b> by any sort of mechanical or adhesive means such as fasteners, pins, etc. For example, in one embodiment, the clamp base <b>114</b> may include tabs <b>113</b> that engage in corresponding slots <b>115</b> on the medical device <b>100</b>. In one embodiment, the clamp base <b>114</b> may include an outwardly extending beam <b>116</b> to which the clamp <b>103</b> is attached, Beam <b>116</b> projects perpendicular to the front surface of the base <b>114</b>. Beam <b>116</b> supports the clamp <b>103</b>, which may be constructed from a first jaw <b>104</b> and a second jaw <b>106</b>. &#x201c;Jaws,&#x201d; as used herein, may be any holding portion or portions that have opposed mating surfaces between which an instrument or device is held. In one embodiment, the jaws may have an arcuate shape such that when placed in a position opposed to one another, the jaws define an open center holding area and have free ends that flare radially outward, creating a guide for leading the second medical device to the center holding area. The jaws <b>104</b>, <b>106</b> may be made from a semi-rigid material that can deform by allowing the jaws to separate at the free ends to allow the second medical device to enter the holding area. The beam <b>116</b> may be positioned on one side of the base <b>114</b> and may be connected to one side of the clamp <b>103</b>. In other embodiments, a first jaw and a second jaw may be pivoted to swing in the center and biased closed with a spring such as a coil spring, leaf spring, or other resilient material.</p>
<p id="p-0026" num="0025">As best seen in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b>B</figref>, an L-shaped hook <b>122</b> extends from the back of the jaw <b>106</b> towards the base <b>114</b> on the side opposite to the beam <b>116</b>. The L-shaped hook <b>122</b> has a tab projecting parallel to the front surface of the base <b>114</b> that can move into and out of a catch <b>120</b> secured to the clamp base <b>114</b>. In one embodiment, the catch <b>122</b> is an arcuate member having a pair of legs secured to the base <b>114</b> and an opening therein into which the tab of the hook <b>122</b> can fit. In a static condition, the tab of the hook <b>122</b> fits within the opening of the catch <b>122</b> so that the tab is at least partially covered by the catch <b>120</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0027" num="0026">The tab of the hook <b>122</b> is movable to a second position where the tab is disengaged from the catch <b>120</b>, The tab of the hook <b>122</b> moves from beneath the catch <b>120</b> when the jaw <b>106</b> is deflected. For example, when a second medical device is forced through the ends of the jaws <b>104</b> and <b>106</b>, the width at the entrance increases, which causes the jaw <b>106</b> to be deflected outward and the tab of the hook <b>122</b> to Move out from under the catch <b>120</b>, When the second medical device passes the narrower entrance between jaws <b>104</b> and <b>106</b> and into the holding area of the clamp, the jaw <b>106</b> returns to its undeflected position and the tab of the hook <b>122</b> returns to lying underneath or being positioned within the catch <b>120</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0028" num="0027">In the embodiment shown, the clamp <b>103</b> also includes a locking mechanism <b>126</b> that may comprise a barrel <b>108</b>, a lever <b>110</b>, and a pawl <b>118</b>. The pawl <b>118</b> is positioned at the distal end of the barrel <b>108</b> and on the flat surface that is perpendicular to the long axis of the barrel <b>108</b>, The lever <b>110</b> may extend outwardly from the opposite end of the barrel <b>108</b> so that movement of the lever <b>110</b> causes the barrel <b>108</b> to rotate about its longitudinal axis. The locking mechanism <b>126</b> is rotatably positioned within a hole <b>124</b> in the base <b>114</b> so that the pawl <b>118</b> protrudes past the surface of the base <b>114</b> and is able to reach to the hook <b>122</b>. The pawl <b>118</b> may include a ridge and a ramp placed orthogonal to the ridge. The base <b>114</b> retains the barrel <b>108</b> within the hole <b>124</b> when the base <b>114</b> is connected to the medical device <b>100</b>. In another embodiment, the lever <b>110</b> may be replaced by a dial that may be rotated to adjust the tension with which the device is held between the jaws.</p>
<p id="p-0029" num="0028">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>1</b>C-<b>1</b>E</figref>, the second medical device <b>101</b> is pressed against the ends of the jaws <b>104</b> and <b>106</b> that cause the jaws to flex. In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b>C</figref>, the pawl <b>118</b> is positioned so as not to interfere with the hook <b>122</b> movement as the jaw <b>106</b> flexes. In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b>D</figref>, as the width at the opening increases, the hook <b>122</b> moves away from under the catch <b>120</b> as the jaws <b>104</b> and <b>106</b> flex outward. In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b>E</figref>, the second medical device <b>101</b> is fully captured by jaws <b>104</b> and <b>106</b>, and the hook <b>122</b> returns to within catch <b>120</b>. The lever <b>110</b> can be pressed to rotate the barrel <b>108</b> and cause the pawl <b>118</b> to engage the hook <b>122</b>. The pawl <b>118</b> first engages the back of the hook <b>122</b> with the ramp to apply pressure that presses the hook <b>122</b> upward so that the pawl <b>118</b> will push the hook <b>122</b> against the catch <b>120</b>. Continued rotation of the barrel eventually pushes the hook up and above the top surface of the pawl <b>118</b> onto the ridge. This action will pinch the second medical device <b>101</b> tighter within clamp <b>102</b>. With the ramp touching the hook <b>122</b> and keeping the hook <b>122</b> in the catch <b>120</b>, the jaws <b>104</b> and <b>106</b> are prevented from flexing, thus, retaining the second medical device <b>101</b> within the clamp <b>103</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0030" num="0029">The inside surfaces of the jaws <b>104</b> and <b>106</b> may be covered by means to enhance the gripping strength between the jaws and the medical device. For example, the surfaces can have means to enhance gripping, including a soft, pliable material, a sticky or tacky material such as a releasable adhesive, magnets, keyed features (i.e., components that fit within other slots or notches), VELCRO&#xae;, surface roughening, and/or additional material wrapped around the catheter.</p>
<p id="p-0031" num="0030">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>2</b>A-<b>2</b>B</figref>, another embodiment of an apparatus for attaching a first medical device <b>100</b> to a second medical device is illustrated. The apparatus may include a base component <b>202</b> and a detachable pincer component <b>200</b>. The medical device <b>100</b> may have structure that attaches to the base component <b>202</b>. The base <b>202</b> may be attached to the medical device <b>100</b> via any mechanical fastener or may be integrated with other components of the medical device <b>100</b>. In the illustrated embodiment, the base component <b>202</b> may be attached to the medical device <b>100</b> via screws that are threaded from one side of the base <b>202</b>. The base <b>202</b> includes an aperture <b>216</b> that extends vertically from top to bottom and faces away from the medical device <b>100</b>, The aperture <b>216</b> extends into a slot <b>217</b> that also extends vertically on the front surface of the base <b>202</b>. The pincer component <b>200</b> includes a post <b>214</b> that slides into the aperture <b>216</b> of the base <b>202</b> from below. The pincer component <b>200</b> includes a web <b>215</b> that connects the post <b>214</b> to the pincer component <b>200</b>, The web <b>215</b> slides within the slot <b>217</b>, while the post <b>214</b> slides into the aperture <b>216</b> to allow the pincer component <b>200</b> to be easily detached from the first medical device <b>100</b>. The apparatus, once it is attached to the first medical device <b>100</b>, is designed to be easily and quickly attached and detached to a second medical device, normally only requiring the use of one hand. Furthermore, the base <b>202</b> and post <b>214</b> allows the second medical device to be easily coupled and decoupled from the first medical device <b>100</b> if the need arises for the second medical device to be operated by a different user without having to disengage the second medical device from the jaws <b>204</b> and <b>206</b>, This may be accomplished by simply inserting the post <b>214</b> into the base <b>202</b> and reversing the process to remove the second medical device.</p>
<p id="p-0032" num="0031">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b>B</figref>, the pincer <b>200</b> is shown in an exploded illustration to more clearly describe the components. The pincer <b>200</b> includes a hinge <b>208</b>, The hinge <b>208</b> has a first and a second ear disposed parallel to one another and joined to each other by an upstanding wall so that the first and second ears are spaced vertically from each other, creating a gap. The post <b>214</b> may be attached to the rear of the upstanding wall via the web <b>215</b>. The first and second ears have apertures in alignment with each other to allow a pivoting pin (not shown) to be inserted there through from the top ear to the bottom ear. The pincer <b>200</b> may include a first jaw <b>204</b> and a second jaw <b>206</b>. Each jaw has an arcuate portion defining half of the pincer <b>200</b> and a lever handle joined to the jaw via a fulcrum structure. The fulcrum is therefore interposed between the jaw and the lever handle. Jaw <b>204</b> has lever handle <b>218</b> joined to the fulcrum comprising lower ear <b>222</b> and upper ear <b>224</b>. Ears <b>222</b> and <b>224</b> have apertures similar in size to the apertures in the ears of hinge <b>208</b>. Jaw <b>206</b> has lever handle <b>220</b> joined to the fulcrum comprising lower ear <b>226</b> and upper ear <b>228</b>. Ears <b>226</b> and <b>228</b> have apertures similar in size to the apertures in the ears of hinge <b>208</b>. Ears <b>222</b> and <b>224</b> of jaw <b>204</b> are spaced wide enough apart from each other to accept ears <b>226</b> and <b>228</b> of jaw <b>206</b>, which are spaced closer to each other. The ears <b>226</b> and <b>228</b> provide a gap vertically between them. The pincer <b>200</b> is constructed by joining jaws <b>204</b> and <b>206</b> together with the hinge <b>208</b> and positioning the coil spring <b>212</b> coaxially with the apertures on the hinge <b>208</b>, Alternate embodiments may eliminate the coil spring <b>212</b> and have flat leaf springs or resilient, but flexible, materials to serve as the biasing device biasing the jaws <b>204</b> and <b>206</b> together. The spring <b>212</b> can fit between lower ear <b>226</b> and upper ear <b>228</b> of jaw <b>206</b>. The retaining pin (not shown) may pass through the apertures in the hinge <b>208</b> and the apertures <b>222</b>, <b>224</b>, <b>226</b> and <b>228</b> of jaws <b>204</b> and <b>206</b>, The spring <b>212</b> may have straight runs at both ends so that the ends can be placed to press against the inside of the lever handles <b>218</b> and <b>220</b> so that the spring <b>212</b> biases the lever handles <b>218</b> and <b>220</b> outward. Therefore, due to the action of the fulcrums, the jaws <b>204</b> and <b>206</b> are biased by spring <b>212</b> inwardly to close, By pressing on the lever handles <b>218</b> and <b>220</b>, the jaws <b>204</b> and <b>206</b> are forced open against the action of the spring <b>212</b>, thus allowing the pincer <b>200</b> to be attached to a second medical device.</p>
<p id="p-0033" num="0032">In other embodiments, the first and second jaws can be joined to each other via a flexible, but resilient hinge material to eliminate the need for a spring and pivoting pin. Such embodiments may resemble the jaw structure illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b>A</figref>, The inside surfaces of the jaws <b>204</b> and <b>206</b> may be covered by means to enhance the gripping strength between the jaws and the medical device. For example, the surfaces can have means to enhance gripping, including a soft, pliable material, a sticky or tacky material such as a releasable adhesive, magnets, keyed features components that fit within other slots or notches), VELCRO&#xae;, surface roughening, and/or additional material wrapped around the catheter.</p>
<p id="p-0034" num="0033">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>3</b>A and <b>3</b>B</figref>, an alternate embodiment of an apparatus for attaching a first medical device to a second medical device is illustrated. The apparatus <b>300</b> has a spring loaded pincer. The apparatus <b>300</b> may include a rack type joint <b>302</b> to enable the detachment of the pincer <b>303</b> from the medical device <b>100</b>. The rack type joint <b>302</b> may be a box-like structure having two vertical walls and two horizontal walls and a stout rear wall that can be attached to the medical device <b>100</b> via mechanical fasteners. The medical device <b>100</b>, in turn, may have structure to mate with the rack type joint <b>302</b> on one side thereof. At the opposite side from the medical device <b>100</b>, the rack type joint <b>302</b> may include means on the top and bottom horizontal walls for detaching the pincer <b>303</b> that may include a first tab <b>306</b> and a second tab <b>308</b> that are flexible to permit deflection in a downward (or upward) motion while hinged at the rear to cause disengagement. The tabs <b>306</b> and <b>308</b> may have ends with serrations pointing, respectively, up and down, and a button placed at about the middle of the tab. The button may be used as the location to depress the tab.</p>
<p id="p-0035" num="0034">An intermediate housing <b>304</b> that supports the pincer <b>303</b> is constructed so as to join to the rack type joint <b>302</b>. The housing <b>304</b> may also be a box-like structure that fits partially over the two vertical and horizontal walls of the rack-type joint. The housing <b>304</b> is inserted into the rack-type joint until the walls of the housing <b>304</b> hit up against a lip surrounding the rack-type joint. The ends of the tabs <b>306</b> and <b>308</b> having serrations, therefore, are inserted immediately next to the interior surface of the housing <b>304</b> at the top and bottom. The housing <b>304</b> has internal mating serrations that engage the serrations of tabs <b>306</b> and <b>308</b>. The button <b>310</b> and the second button that is opposite and connected to tab <b>308</b>, which is not shown, are used to depress tabs <b>306</b> and <b>308</b> inwardly so as to disengage the housing <b>304</b> from the rack-type joint <b>302</b>, The apparatus once it is attached to the first medical device <b>100</b> is designed to be easily and quickly attached and detached to a second medical device, normally only requiring the use of one hand. Furthermore, the button <b>310</b> and the one not shown allows the second medical device to be easily coupled and decoupled from the first medical device <b>100</b> if the need arises for the second medical device to be operated by a different user without having to disengage the second medical device from the jaws of the clamp. This is accomplished by snapping the housing <b>304</b> to the rack-type joint <b>302</b> to attach the second medical device and then pressing the buttons to release the second medical device. The rack-type joint <b>302</b> may further include a box <b>309</b> in the interior thereof. The box <b>309</b> may have a first rod <b>311</b> and a second rod <b>313</b> rotatably placed on the opposite sides of the box <b>309</b> and at the front of the box <b>309</b>, the function of which will be described below.</p>
<p id="p-0036" num="0035">The housing <b>304</b> supports the pincer device <b>303</b> on one side thereof. The housing <b>304</b> includes the aperture <b>330</b> on the top wall of the housing and aperture <b>331</b> on the bottom wall of the housing <b>304</b>. Both apertures are in vertical alignment to accept a retaining pin (not shown) that acts as a pivot for a first jaw <b>312</b> and a second jaw <b>314</b>. A handle for manually applying pressure may be connected to each jaw, Jaw <b>312</b> has handle <b>330</b>. Jaw <b>314</b> has handle <b>332</b>. Each jaw may have structure to act as a fulcrum comprising an upper and lower ear with an aperture. Each jaw may also possess an extension behind the fulcrum to act as a lever. Jaw <b>312</b> has lower ear <b>320</b> and upper ear <b>322</b> connecting the arcuate portion to the extension <b>333</b>. Extension <b>333</b> and handle <b>330</b> are on the opposite side of the fulcrum ears <b>320</b> and <b>322</b> to be able to apply leverage to the jaw <b>312</b>. Jaw <b>314</b> has lower ear <b>328</b> and upper ear <b>326</b> connecting the arcuate portion to the extension <b>329</b>. Extension <b>329</b> and handle <b>332</b> are on the opposite side of fulcrum ears <b>326</b> and <b>328</b> to be able to apply leverage to the jaw <b>314</b>. Ears <b>326</b> and <b>328</b> are alternately engaged with the corresponding ears <b>320</b> and <b>322</b> of jaw <b>312</b>. Apertures are provided in each of the ears <b>320</b> and <b>322</b> of jaw <b>312</b> and the ears <b>326</b> and <b>328</b> of jaw <b>314</b> so that a retaining pin can be positioned within them to further engage with the apertures <b>330</b> and <b>331</b> of the housing <b>304</b>, thus allowing jaws <b>312</b> and <b>314</b> to pivot at the retaining pin. The upper ear <b>326</b> of jaw <b>314</b> includes a skirt having a raised circumference, and the lower ear <b>320</b> of jaw <b>312</b> includes a similar skirt so as to allow coil spring <b>318</b> to be placed within skirt of ear <b>326</b> and coil spring <b>316</b> within skirt of ear <b>320</b>. Alternate embodiments may eliminate the coil springs <b>316</b> and <b>318</b> and have flat leaf springs or resilient, but flexible, materials to serve as the biasing device biasing the jaws <b>312</b> and <b>314</b> together, Springs <b>316</b> and <b>318</b> have straight runs at the ends at about right angles to each other. Skirts of ears <b>326</b> and <b>320</b> include a slit <b>327</b> made in the skirt so as to anchor one end of the spring. The other end of the spring extends over and outside the skirt and is placed against structure on the inside of housing <b>304</b>, For example, spring <b>318</b> fits within skirt of ear <b>326</b>, and a straight end of spring <b>318</b> fits into slit <b>327</b>, and the other end of spring <b>318</b> extends above the skirt and abuts against the inside of the housing <b>304</b> at a suitable place to act as an anchor for the spring <b>318</b>. Spring <b>316</b> is likewise placed in jaw <b>312</b>. Thus, springs <b>316</b> and <b>318</b> maintain jaws <b>312</b> and <b>314</b> normally closed. Depressing handles <b>330</b> and <b>332</b> counteracts the spring forces, allowing jaws <b>312</b> and <b>314</b> to be opened to allow a second medical device to be placed therein. When housing <b>304</b> with pincer <b>303</b> is slid onto rack-type joint <b>302</b>, the extension <b>333</b> passes on the outside of the rod <b>311</b> of box <b>309</b> and the extension <b>329</b> passes on the outside of the rod <b>313</b> so as housing <b>304</b> is pressed against the rack-type joint <b>302</b>, the extensions <b>333</b> and <b>329</b> are spread apart or at least are forced apart to close jaws <b>312</b> and <b>314</b> more securely.</p>
<p id="p-0037" num="0036">In other embodiments, the first and second jaws can be joined to each other via a flexible, but resilient hinge material to eliminate the need for springs and pivoting pins. Such embodiment may resemble the jaw structure illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b>A</figref>. The inside surfaces of the jaws <b>312</b> and <b>314</b> may be covered by means to enhance the gripping strength between the jaws and the medical device. For example, the surfaces can have means to enhance gripping, including a soft, pliable material, a sticky or tacky material such as a releasable adhesive, magnets, keyed features (i.e., components that fit within other slots or notches), VELCRO&#xae;, surface roughening, and/or additional material wrapped around the catheter.</p>
<p id="p-0038" num="0037">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>4</b>A-<b>4</b>B</figref>, another embodiment of an apparatus <b>400</b> is illustrated for attaching a first medical device to a second medical device. The apparatus <b>400</b> may include a base component <b>402</b> and a wire tie component <b>400</b>. The base <b>402</b> is illustrated being attached to the medical device <b>100</b>. Attachment of base <b>402</b> to medical device <b>100</b> may be via mechanical fasteners, for example. Base <b>402</b> may comprise an aperture <b>406</b> disposed vertically on the base <b>402</b> and centrally located between the sides of the base <b>402</b>, The aperture <b>406</b> may be connected to a slot <b>407</b> also extending vertically on the base <b>402</b> and on the side of the base <b>402</b> that is opposite to the medical device <b>100</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0039" num="0038">The wire tie component <b>400</b> may include a buckle <b>401</b>. The buckle <b>401</b> may be a box-like structure having a top and bottom wall, a back wall, and a front wall that extends beyond the top and bottom walls. The buckle <b>401</b> includes first <b>408</b> and second <b>410</b> walls placed at an angle on the front wall to support the second medical device. Finally, the buckle <b>401</b> has a side wall, but the opposite side of the buckle <b>401</b> is generally open, the purpose of which will be described below. The back wall of the buckle <b>401</b> may support an upwardly-pointing post <b>404</b> attached via web <b>405</b> that fits within the aperture <b>406</b> and slot <b>407</b> on the base <b>402</b>. The buckle <b>401</b> may include a flexible strap <b>412</b> that is connected on one side wall of the buckle <b>401</b>. The strap <b>412</b> may be flexible such that the strap <b>412</b> can be bent around from one side of the buckle <b>401</b> to the other to hold a second medical device to the buckle <b>401</b>. The strap <b>412</b> may include a tip <b>414</b> having serrations <b>416</b> on the end opposite to the end of the strap <b>412</b> that is attached to the buckle <b>401</b>. The tip <b>414</b> may be placed at a right angle to the remainder of the strap <b>412</b>. The strap <b>412</b> includes a button <b>424</b> that may be placed by the tip <b>414</b> and may be integrally molded to the strap <b>412</b>. The strap <b>412</b> may loop around the second medical device, so that the tip <b>414</b> of the strap <b>412</b> may be inserted into the buckle <b>401</b> on the side of the buckle <b>401</b> that is generally open but includes a receiving guide <b>418</b> to guide the tip <b>414</b> into the buckle <b>401</b> in a desired location.</p>
<p id="p-0040" num="0039">Referring specifically to the cross-sectional illustration of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b>C</figref>, the strap <b>412</b> (also shown in phantom) may be looped around so that the tip <b>414</b> is inserted within the receiving guide <b>418</b> of the buckle <b>401</b> on the open side of the buckle <b>401</b>. A tab <b>420</b> is supported by a wall also supporting the fixed end of the strap <b>412</b>. The connection between the tab <b>420</b> and the wall is flexible and acts as a hinge <b>422</b> that allows the tab <b>420</b> to reciprocate up and down as serrations on the tip <b>414</b> slide by. The tab <b>420</b> includes serrations that face in the opposite direction as the serrations of the tip <b>414</b>, Thus, the tip <b>414</b> can be locked in position with the tab <b>420</b>. The tip <b>414</b> may be released by application of pressure against a lever handle attached to the tab <b>420</b>, which causes the serrations of the tab <b>420</b> to disengage with the serrations of the tip <b>414</b> and allows the strap <b>412</b> to disengage from the buckle <b>401</b> and release the second medical device.</p>
<p id="p-0041" num="0040">In other embodiments, instead of the strap <b>412</b> having serrations at the tip <b>414</b>, the strap <b>412</b> may have other joining members, such as a hook and loop fastener, snap buttons, or the like. The inside surface of the strap <b>412</b> may be covered by means to enhance the gripping strength between the strap and the medical device. For example, the surface can have means to enhance gripping, including a soft, pliable material, a sticky or tacky material such as a releasable adhesive, magnets, keyed features (i.e., components that fit within other slots or notches), VELCRO&#xae; surface roughening, and/or additional material wrapped around the catheter.</p>
<p id="p-0042" num="0041">The apparatus once it is attached to the first medical device <b>100</b> is designed to be easily and quickly attached and detached to a second medical device, normally only requiring the use of one hand. Furthermore, the base <b>402</b> and post <b>404</b> allows the second medical device to be easily coupled and decoupled from the first medical device <b>100</b> if the need arises for the second medical device to be operated by a different user without having to disengage the second medical device from the strap <b>412</b>. This may be accomplished by simply inserting the post <b>404</b> onto the base <b>402</b> and reversing the process to remove the second medical device.</p>
<p id="p-0043" num="0042">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>5</b>A-<b>5</b>D</figref>, an apparatus <b>500</b> for attaching a first medical device to a second medical device is illustrated. The apparatus <b>500</b> may include a base component <b>502</b> that may be attachable to a first medical device, such as medical device <b>100</b>, and a clamp component <b>504</b>. The base <b>502</b> may include a top plate <b>503</b> positioned orthogonal to the base <b>502</b>. The top plate <b>503</b> may include a rectangular slot <b>506</b> at the distal side. Slot <b>506</b> acts as an anchor for a corresponding peg of the clamp component <b>504</b>. The base <b>502</b> may include a spring <b>508</b>. The spring <b>508</b> may include a flat strip of material formed as an S-curve of adequate width to accommodate a second slot <b>512</b> on the bottom leg of the S-curve of equal length as the slot <b>506</b> on the top plate <b>503</b>. The upper leg of the S-curve may be attached perpendicular to the flat front surface of base <b>502</b> opposite to the side which is attached to the first medical device. The bottom leg of the S-curve is connected to a handle <b>510</b>. The handle <b>510</b> can be depressed, thus, compressing the bottom leg of the S-curve and decreasing the distance between the first slot <b>506</b> and the second slot <b>512</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0044" num="0043">The clamp component <b>504</b> may include a bracket to removably secure the clamp to the first medical device. The bracket may include a top peg <b>514</b> attached to a sideways arm and a second bottom peg <b>516</b> attached to a sideways arm, each peg may be sized to enter into the respective first top slot <b>506</b> and the second bottom slot <b>512</b>. Both arms that hold pegs <b>514</b> and <b>516</b> may extend sideways before turning up at the ends. The upper peg is pointed up and the bottom peg has a ramp and a ledge behind the ramp at the end of the peg. The upper peg <b>514</b> may be first engaged with the slot <b>506</b> from below the slot <b>506</b>. The clamp component <b>504</b> pivots around the first top peg <b>514</b> so that the ramp at the end of the lower peg <b>516</b> strikes a ramp of opposite slope on the end of the bottom leg of the S-curve. Continued application of force causes the bottom leg of the S-curve to deform slightly upwards to allow the peg <b>516</b> to engage the slot <b>512</b>. When the handle <b>510</b> is pushed up, the reduced distance releases the bottom peg <b>516</b> from slot <b>512</b>, and thus, the clamp component <b>504</b> can be removed from the base <b>502</b>. The apparatus once it is attached to the first medical device <b>100</b> is designed to be easily and quickly attached and detached to a second medical device, normally only requiring the use of one hand. Furthermore, the pegs <b>514</b> and <b>516</b> may allow the second medical device to be easily coupled and decoupled from the first medical device <b>100</b> if the need arises for the second medical device to be operated by a different user without having to disengage the second medical device from the jaws of the clamp <b>504</b> by simply operating the handle <b>510</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0045" num="0044">The clamp component <b>504</b> may include a first <b>518</b> and a second <b>520</b> jaw. The second jaw <b>520</b> supports the first and the second pegs described above, Each jaw has an arcuate portion followed by a straight portion. The first jaw <b>518</b> is connected to the second jaw <b>520</b> via a living hinge <b>522</b> after the arcuate portions and at the straight portions. Living hinge <b>522</b> may be a flexible strip of material that is narrower at the center to allow flexing of the jaws <b>518</b> and <b>520</b> to open or close. Jaws <b>518</b> and <b>520</b> continue as extensions <b>528</b> and <b>530</b> on the opposite side of the living hinge <b>522</b>. First jaw <b>518</b> and second jaw <b>520</b> form a pincer device where living hinge <b>522</b> acts as a fulcrum and extensions <b>528</b> and <b>530</b> of jaws <b>518</b> and <b>520</b> behind the living hinge <b>522</b> act as levers that can be pressed nearer to each other to open the jaws or spread apart to close the jaws. For example, pressing the extensions <b>528</b> and <b>530</b> nearer to one another causes jaws <b>518</b> and <b>520</b> to open wider, while pushing extensions <b>528</b> and <b>530</b> apart closes the jaws <b>518</b> and <b>520</b>. A locking mechanism includes a toggle joint.</p>
<p id="p-0046" num="0045">A toggle joint acts to push extensions <b>528</b> and <b>530</b> apart and, thus, to close the jaws. The toggle joint may be made from a first leg <b>526</b> and a second leg <b>528</b> joined to each other at about midway of the living hinge <b>522</b>, resembling a knee <b>525</b>. The combined length of leg <b>524</b> and leg <b>526</b> when straightened is greater than the length of the living hinge <b>522</b>. When a force is applied to straighten the knee <b>525</b>, the opposite ends of the legs <b>526</b> and <b>528</b> apply an outward force or push against the extensions <b>528</b> and <b>530</b> and close the jaws <b>518</b> and <b>520</b>. The inner surfaces of the extensions <b>528</b> and <b>530</b> include a groove or socket, as best seen in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>5</b>C and <b>5</b>D</figref>, The sockets of the extensions <b>528</b> and <b>530</b> are each engaged with one leg of the toggle joint. The first leg <b>526</b> is pivotally attached to the inner surface of extension <b>528</b>, The second leg <b>524</b> is pivotally attached to the inner surface of the extension <b>530</b>, Both legs <b>526</b> and <b>524</b> are pivotally attached to each other at the knee <b>525</b>, Leg <b>524</b> is connected to a lever <b>530</b> attached perpendicular to leg <b>524</b>, Referring specifically to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b>C</figref>, in a first position, the knee <b>525</b> juts outward and bends away from the hinge <b>522</b>. This is the no-load configuration that allows the living hinge <b>522</b> to flex. When the knee <b>525</b> juts outward or bends away, there is no compressive force on legs <b>524</b> and <b>526</b> because there is no resistance against the jaws <b>518</b> and <b>520</b> opening. The inside surfaces of jaws <b>518</b> and <b>520</b> are shown slightly open and not fully pressing against the second medical device <b>101</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0047" num="0046">As seen in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b>D</figref>, moving the lever <b>530</b> to the opposite side forces the knee <b>525</b> to straighten, which causes the extensions <b>528</b> and <b>530</b> to be spread further apart, eventually reaching the point where the knee <b>525</b> bends inwards and towards the hinge <b>522</b>. This has the effect of closing the jaws <b>518</b>, <b>520</b> around the second medical device <b>101</b>. Resistance to moving the lever <b>530</b> will be felt when the jaws <b>518</b>, <b>520</b> touch the second medical device <b>101</b>, Continued movement of the lever <b>530</b> to the opposite side continually increases the separation distance between extensions <b>528</b> and <b>530</b> up to the point when the knee <b>525</b> is straight. Past this point, the knee <b>525</b> will jut inwards or bend towards the hinge <b>522</b> and release some of the pressure that is applied to the extensions <b>528</b> and <b>530</b>. It is at this point that the knee <b>525</b> can be prevented from moving further as just after the knee <b>525</b> juts inward or bends towards the hinge <b>522</b>, the toggle joint may apply close to the maximum pressure on the jaws <b>518</b>, <b>520</b>, This is the loaded configuration because the jaws <b>518</b> and <b>520</b> not being able to close further around the second medical device <b>101</b> places the legs <b>524</b> and <b>526</b> under tension that prevents the knee <b>525</b> from returning to the outward jutting configuration, Thus, the second medical device <b>101</b> is secured within jaws <b>518</b> and <b>520</b>. The medical device <b>101</b> can be released by returning the lever <b>530</b> to the original position, as illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b>C</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0048" num="0047">In alternate embodiments, the first and second jaws may be replaced by any of the jaw structures as illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b>A, <b>2</b>B</figref>, or <b>3</b>B, The inside surfaces of the jaws <b>518</b> and <b>520</b> may be covered by means to enhance the gripping strength between the jaws and the medical device. For example, the surfaces can have means to enhance gripping, including a soft, pliable material, a sticky or tacky material such as a releasable adhesive, magnets, keyed features (i.e., components that fit within other slots or notches), VELCRO&#xae;, surface roughening, and/or additional material wrapped around the catheter.</p>
<p id="p-0049" num="0048">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>6</b>A-<b>6</b>C</figref>, an alternate embodiment of an apparatus <b>600</b> for attaching a first medical device to a second medical device is illustrated.

The base <b>610</b> may have a flat surface <b>611</b> on the side opposite from the mechanical connection to the medical device. The apparatus <b>600</b> may include a first jaw <b>602</b> and a second jaw <b>604</b> connected to one another via a joining wall <b>612</b>, The jaws <b>602</b> and <b>604</b> extend behind the wall <b>612</b> into beams <b>614</b> and <b>616</b> that are rigidly connected to the surface <b>611</b> of the base <b>610</b>, Each jaw <b>602</b> and <b>604</b> may be curved or bowed so that the placement of the jaws <b>602</b> and <b>604</b> with the bowed portions facing each other define a wide center area for accepting a second medical device and a narrow opening defined at or close to the ends of the jaws <b>602</b> and <b>604</b>. A sliding ring <b>606</b> is supported within slots created in jaws <b>602</b> and <b>604</b> that allow the sliding ring <b>606</b> to be rotated in relation to the jaws <b>602</b> and <b>604</b>. For example, the end of jaw <b>602</b> includes a slot through which the end of the sliding ring <b>606</b> is passed. The jaw <b>604</b> includes a slot that allows the opposite end of the sliding ring <b>606</b> to pass through. The sliding ring <b>606</b> includes a handle <b>608</b> on the end that allows rotating the sliding ring <b>606</b> within the slots of the jaws <b>602</b> and <b>604</b>. As best seen in the cross-sectional illustrations of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>6</b>B and <b>6</b>C</figref>, the sliding ring <b>606</b> defines less than a complete circumference of a circle. The sliding ring <b>606</b> has a gap in its circumference that is generally proportionate to the opening between the first jaw <b>602</b> and the second jaw <b>604</b>. As illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>6</b>B</figref>, the gap in the sliding ring <b>606</b> can be aligned with the opening between the jaws <b>602</b> and <b>604</b> to allow a medical device <b>101</b> to pass by the opening and be placed within the interior of the first and the second jaws <b>602</b> and <b>604</b>, In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>6</b>C</figref>, the sliding ring <b>606</b> is illustrated being rotated via the handle <b>608</b>. Thus, the end of the sliding ring <b>606</b> may close the opening between jaws <b>602</b> and <b>604</b>, thereby retaining the second medical device within the jaws <b>602</b> and <b>604</b>. The forward end of the sliding ring <b>606</b> may engage with the jaw <b>604</b> under pressure so that the jaws <b>602</b> and <b>604</b> apply a squeezing force on the medical device <b>101</b>, To release the medical device <b>101</b>, the handle <b>608</b> may be moved to the position shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>6</b>B</figref>, thus creating the opening between the jaws <b>602</b> and <b>604</b> once again to release the second medical device <b>101</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0050" num="0049">The inside surfaces of the jaws <b>602</b> and <b>604</b> and the sliding ring <b>606</b> may be covered by means to enhance the gripping strength between the jaws and the medical device. For example, the surfaces can have means to enhance gripping, including a soft, pliable material, a sticky or tacky material such as a releasable adhesive, magnets, keyed features (i.e., components that fit within other slots or notches), VELCRO&#xae;, surface roughening, and/or additional material wrapped around the catheter. For example, in one embodiment, the sliding ring <b>606</b> may have a smaller inside diameter than the inside diameter defined by the jaws <b>602</b> and <b>604</b>. The sliding ring <b>606</b> may then engage with a corresponding groove or notch around the outer circumference of the medical device <b>101</b>. Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>7</b>A-<b>7</b>D</figref>, an embodiment of an apparatus <b>700</b> for attaching a first medical device to a second medical device is illustrated. The apparatus <b>700</b> may include a clamp attached to a base <b>702</b>, The base <b>702</b> may be attachable to a first medical device via any mechanical or adhesive means. The apparatus <b>700</b> may include a first jaw <b>704</b> and a second jaw <b>706</b> connected to each other via a flexible transverse wall <b>712</b>. The interior surfaces of the jaw <b>704</b>, wall <b>712</b>, and jaw <b>706</b> combine to form an arcuate shape, such as a portion of a circle. The jaw <b>704</b> extends behind the wall <b>712</b> and forms a beam <b>714</b> that is connected to the surface of the base <b>702</b> on one side of the base <b>702</b>. As appreciated from <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>713</b></figref>, the first jaw <b>704</b>, the second jaw <b>706</b>, and the intermediate wall <b>712</b> are joined to the base <b>702</b> via the beam <b>714</b> that extends from jaw <b>704</b>. The opposite jaw <b>706</b> extends past the wall <b>712</b> and forms a block <b>716</b> having at least a straight edge facing inward. As depicted in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>7</b>B</figref>, when a second medical device is pressed against the opening defined by the ends of the jaws <b>704</b> and <b>706</b>, jaws <b>704</b> and <b>706</b> will spread apart, allowing the second medical device to be captured within the jaws <b>704</b> and <b>706</b>, Jaw <b>706</b> may experience most of the movement as intermediate wall <b>712</b> may flex to allow jaw <b>706</b> to open. Once within jaws <b>704</b> and <b>706</b>, the medical device can be locked in position by a locking mechanism.</p>
<p id="p-0051" num="0050">A locking mechanism may include a disk <b>722</b> that is rotationally attached to the base <b>702</b>. The disk <b>722</b> is positioned between the base <b>702</b> and the intermediate wall <b>712</b> and attached to the base <b>702</b> at its center via a pivot pin to allow rotation of the disk <b>722</b>. The disk <b>722</b> defines a earning surface on the side of the disk <b>722</b> and formed from the outer circumference of the disk <b>722</b>. The raining surface may include a first cut-out <b>724</b> and a second cut-out <b>726</b> formed from reduced thickness areas of the disk <b>722</b>. The first cut-out <b>724</b> may define a straight edge that cuts the disk <b>722</b> along a chord of a circle close to the circumference of the disk <b>722</b>. The second cut-out <b>726</b> may define a second straight edge that cuts the disk <b>722</b> along a chord of a circle that is farther away from the circumference of the disk <b>722</b>. The straight edge of cut-out <b>724</b> and the straight edge of cut-out <b>726</b> may be positioned at right angles to each other, and a transition between them may comprise a rounded corner. The cam surface therefore includes an edge of varying thickness along the perimeter of the disk <b>722</b> and on the side of the disk <b>722</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0052" num="0051">Referring to the cross-sectional illustration of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>7</b>C</figref>, the block <b>716</b> is shown in position within the cut-out <b>726</b> so that the straight edge of the block <b>714</b> may be generally parallel to the straight edge of the out-out <b>726</b>. There may be a gap between the edge of the block <b>716</b> and the edge of the cut-out <b>726</b> and, thus, allows the jaw <b>706</b> to which block <b>716</b> is attached to be flexed as described above. Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>7</b>D</figref>, the handle <b>720</b> attached to the disk <b>722</b> may be moved to rotate the disk <b>722</b> so that the edge of the out-out <b>724</b> lies generally parallel and touching or very nearly touching the straight edge of the block <b>716</b>, and may even have pressed against the block <b>724</b> with a slight force so as to put pressure on the jaw <b>706</b>. As can be appreciated, the block <b>716</b> has little to no room to flex to the side because of the nearness of the straight edge of the out-out <b>724</b> against the block <b>716</b>. Thus, in the configuration shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>7</b>D</figref>, the jaw <b>706</b> is prevented from opening. Therefore, the second medical device is securely held within jaws <b>704</b> and <b>706</b> illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>7</b>D</figref>, The inside surfaces of the jaws <b>704</b> and <b>706</b> may be covered by means to enhance the gripping strength between the jaws and the medical device. For example, the surfaces can have means to enhance gripping, including a soft, pliable material, a sticky or tacky material such as a releasable adhesive, magnets, keyed features (i.e., components that fit within other slots or notches), VELCRO&#xae;, surface roughening, and/or additional material wrapped around the catheter.</p>
<p id="p-0053" num="0052">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>8</b>A and <b>8</b>B</figref>, an embodiment of an apparatus for attaching a first medical device to a second medical device is illustrated. The first medical device <b>100</b> may include a flexible strap <b>800</b> attached on one side of the medical device <b>100</b>. Next to the strap <b>800</b> is a receptacle <b>808</b> for receiving a second medical device. Receptacle <b>808</b> can be an indentation that conforms to the shape of the second medical device. The medical device <b>100</b> may include structure <b>802</b> having a slot <b>808</b> that is provided on the side of the medical device that is opposite to the side on which the strap <b>800</b> is attached. Slot <b>808</b> extends from a forward opening to a rear opening to allow strap <b>800</b> to pass therethrough from front to back. A cylindrical earn <b>804</b> positioned on one side in the path through the slot <b>808</b> has a pivoting pin <b>806</b> placed off-center in the cam <b>804</b> so that upon rotation of the cam <b>804</b>, the earn <b>804</b> will cause a narrowing or constriction of the slot <b>808</b> between the cam's <b>804</b> surface and the opposite side of the slot <b>808</b>, The strap <b>800</b> can be wrapped around a second medical device <b>101</b>, as best seen in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>8</b>B</figref>, The strap <b>800</b> has a free end which is inserted through the slot <b>808</b> between the first medical device <b>100</b> and the off-center cam <b>804</b>. The cam <b>804</b> can have serrations or pyramid-like projections on the surface to &#x201c;bite&#x201d; against the strap <b>800</b>. Thus, when the end of the strap <b>800</b> is inserted within the slot <b>808</b>, the end of the strap <b>800</b> pivots the cam <b>804</b> to align the narrow portion of the cam <b>804</b> next to the slot <b>808</b> to have adequate width for passage of the strap <b>800</b> through the slot <b>808</b>, When the direction of the strap <b>800</b> is reversed, such as when the strap <b>800</b> is pulled, the cam <b>804</b> pivots so that the wider part of the cam <b>804</b> is turned to face the slot <b>808</b>, thus narrowing the width of the slot <b>808</b> next to the earn <b>804</b> that causes the cam <b>804</b> to wedge itself against the strap <b>800</b>. In use, the strap <b>800</b> may first be pulled tight against the second medical device <b>101</b>. When the strap <b>800</b> is released, the cam <b>804</b> bites against the strap <b>800</b>, thus preventing the strap <b>800</b> from releasing. As alternatives to an off-center cam, the can can have an eccentric lobe or the cam can travel along a widening guide where the slot is widest when the cam travels down the guide and the slot is narrowest when the cam is closest to the front of the guide.</p>

The apparatus may include an over-center clamp <b>1100</b> and a base <b>1102</b> that may be mechanically fastened on one side to a first medical device. The base <b>1102</b> has a surface provided opposite to the medical device to support a first jaw <b>1102</b> and a second jaw <b>1104</b>. The jaw <b>1102</b> is supported by and pivots on hinge <b>1106</b>. The jaw <b>1104</b> is supported by and pivots on hinge <b>1104</b>.

The bosses <b>1112</b> and <b>1114</b> are arranged to create over-center action to lock the second medical device <b>101</b> in place. As best seen in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1113</b></figref>, when the jaws <b>1102</b> and <b>1104</b> are opened, the bosses <b>1112</b> and <b>1114</b> are not touching each other. As a medical device <b>101</b> is being pushed against the rear of the jaws <b>1102</b> and <b>1104</b> and bosses <b>1112</b> and <b>1114</b>, the jaws <b>1102</b> and <b>1104</b> begin to close and the bosses <b>1112</b> and <b>1114</b> approach one another and may eventually touch. After the bosses <b>1112</b> and <b>1114</b> make contact with one another, resistance may be felt to further pushing of the medical device. However, increasing the application of pressure on the medical device <b>101</b> overcomes the resistance. When the bosses <b>1112</b> and <b>1114</b> cross the point where, because of the pivoting nature of the bosses, the bosses are no longer being pushed against each other and have crossed the center and are beginning to separate from one another, the bosses gradually release some of the stored tension, and it is at this point that because of the reversal of forces and the separation of the bosses <b>1112</b> and <b>1114</b>, the jaws <b>1102</b> and <b>1104</b> are forced against the medical device <b>101</b> so that the jaws <b>1102</b> and <b>1104</b> hold the medical device <b>101</b> in place. Removal of the medical device <b>101</b> is effected by overcoming the resistance to pushing the bosses <b>1112</b> and <b>1114</b> closer to each other over the center, but in the opposite direction, until and because of the pivoting nature, the bosses will begin to separate and release the medical device <b>101</b>.</p>

The attachment of the apparatus <b>1402</b> to the medical device <b>1404</b> can be via any mechanical fastener or an adhesive. The apparatus <b>1402</b> includes a base <b>1450</b> which is attached to the medical device <b>1404</b>, From the base <b>1450</b>, one or more support beams <b>1428</b> extend away and generally perpendicular to the long axis of the medical device <b>1404</b>. Support beams can be defined as upper lateral, upper medial, lower lateral, and lower medial. Each pair of support beams on either the lateral or medial side includes a first upper and a second lower support beam, which define a slot therebetween the first upper support beam and the second lower support beam. The upper lateral and medial support beams have an arcuate shape facing inwardly toward each other. The lower lateral and medial support beams have an arcuate shape facing inwardly toward each other. An elastomeric material <b>1408</b> is provided within the inner perimeter of the support beams, the function of which is to &#x201c;hug&#x201d; the second medical device <b>1401</b>, As best seen in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>14</b>D</figref>, the elastomeric material <b>1408</b> includes two opposite, but similar holders <b>1414</b> and <b>1416</b>, The apparatus <b>1402</b> may include a first set of upper holders <b>1414</b> and <b>1416</b> and a second set of holders that are not shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>14</b>D</figref>, but are beneath the holders <b>1414</b> and <b>1416</b>.

Each holder <b>1414</b> and <b>1416</b> and the bottom set of holders has an inside arcuate shape, which comes to a narrow constriction and which then turn outward to receive the second medical device <b>1401</b>, The set of holders <b>1414</b> and <b>1416</b> defines a funnel leading to a narrowing point or constriction, which then leads to the inside of the apparatus <b>1402</b>. Both sets of elastomeric holders are extensions of an elastomeric hugger. The elastomeric hugger <b>1408</b> is supported by the support beams. The elastomeric hugger <b>1408</b> forms a pad within the inside perimeter of the support beams. The elastomeric hugger <b>1408</b> formed from elastomeric material provides a soft contact with the second medical device <b>1401</b> to which it is attached and, in addition, ensures a wide range of compatibility with medical devices due to the deformable and compliant material of construction.

This applies to all embodiments herein disclosed. The pressure foot <b>1424</b> keeps pressure on the interlocking ratcheting teeth <b>1422</b> and <b>1428</b> to prevent accidental disengagement. Once engaged to the medical device <b>1401</b>, the ratcheting clip <b>1410</b> can be disengaged by applying a force against the inside of the ear <b>1415</b>, which causes the pressure foot <b>1424</b> to lift, allowing the memory of the material to cause the extension <b>1420</b> to return to non-stressed condition and disengage the ratcheting teeth <b>1422</b> from the ratcheting teeth <b>1428</b>. The ears <b>1418</b> and <b>1415</b> are used to apply pressure to bring the ratcheting arms <b>1411</b> and <b>1413</b> into engagement with one another and close around the medical device <b>1401</b>. As pressure is applied on the ears <b>1418</b> and <b>1415</b>, the elastomeric hugger <b>1408</b> may be deformed, thus securely holding the medical device <b>1401</b> to the medical device <b>1404</b>.</p>
