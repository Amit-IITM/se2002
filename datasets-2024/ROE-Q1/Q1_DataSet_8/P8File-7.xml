<p id="p-0003" num="0002">The invention relates to methods and compositions for reduction of off-flavor, in particular addition of microbial biomass to aqueous environments and aquaculture systems.</p>
<heading id="h-0003" level="1">BACKGROUND</heading>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">While a major world consumer of seafood by volume, the United States' domestic seafood production is limited. As a result, 90% of the seafood consumed in the US is imported, and the seafood trade deficit has grown to $14 billion in 2016&#x2014;second only to oil. Aquaculture will play a major role in meeting the ever-growing demand for seafood while increasing national self-sufficiency. Aquaculture is rapidly expanding to meet the growing need for sustainable protein sources. Recently, several large commercial aquaculture farms have started their operations as recirculated aquaculture systems (RAS). These enterprises are being closely watched by the seafood community as they could play a key role in meeting the domestic need for high quality fish. However, RAS facilities face many challenges, chief among them off-flavor mitigation and sourcing high quality fish feed.</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">These off-flavors are primarily caused by two molecules&#x2014;geosmin (GSM) and 2-methylisoborneol (2-MIB), which are known to accumulate in fish grown in RAS&#x2014;and pond-based aquaculture operations. These compounds are produced by microorganisms such as cyanobacteria or actinomycetes and vary depending on water quality and season. To mitigate these off-flavors, production facilities expend valuable resources to purge the fish of this &#x201c;muddy&#x201d; flavor. This purging, also known as depuration, involves cycling the RAS with clean water and holding the fish until off-flavors are reduced below an acceptable threshold. While generally effective, there are drawbacks including weight loss (up to 5%) and an extended production cycle prior to the product reaching market. Improved methods for mitigating production of off-flavor compounds and modulating the taste perception of aquatic species grown in aquaculture systems are needed.</p>
<heading id="h-0004" level="1">BRIEF SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">Methods for modulating the off-flavor taste found in either aquatic species grown in an aquaculture system or for aqueous environments including municipal water supplies are provided herein.</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">In one aspect, methods are provided for decreasing off-flavor in an aquatic species for human or animal consumption. The methods include providing biomass derived from a microorganism to an aquatic species in an aquaculture production system. Off-flavor is reduced in the tissues, e.g., edible tissues, of the aquatic species, in comparison to the aquatic species grown under identical conditions in the absence of the biomass. In some embodiments, the biomass does not mask off-flavor (e.g., mask the flavor of one or more off-flavor compound) present in tissues of the aquatic species or alter the natural flavor of the aquatic species.</p>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">In some embodiments, the biomass is provided in the form of a feed ingredient (e.g., as a component of a feed composition) that is consumed by the aquatic species. In some embodiments, the biomass is provided as part of a finishing feed, which is provided after feeding the aquatic species one or more different feed, such as a starter feed and/or a growout feed, to reduce off-flavor prior to harvesting the aquatic species. In other embodiments, the biomass is the only feed consumed by the aquatic species throughout its growth cycle.</p>
<p id="p-0009" num="0008">In some embodiments, the aquaculture production system is a recirculating aquaculture system (RAS), a partial RAS system (e.g., a RAS system with a lower degree of recirculation, such as a system in which a portion of the water is recirculated), a pond, a cage, or a flow through system.</p>
<p id="p-0010" num="0009">In some embodiments, the amount of one or more off-flavor producing compounds is modulated in the aquatic species. For example, the amount of one or more off-flavor producing compounds may be decreased or increased by at least about 10 parts per trillion (ppt), in comparison to the aquatic species grown under identical conditions in the absence of the feed containing the biomass. The one or more off-flavor compounds may include 2-methylisoborneol (2-MIB) and/or trans-1,10-dimethyl-trans-9-decalol (geosmin; GSM). In one embodiment, 2-MIB in the aquatic species, e.g., in edible tissues, of the aquatic species, is decreased by at least about 10 ppt, in comparison to the aquatic species grown under identical conditions in the absence of the feed containing the biomass. In some embodiments, GSM in the aquatic species, e.g., in edible tissues, of the aquatic species, is reduced by at least about 10 ppt, in comparison to the aquatic species grown under identical conditions in the absence of the feed containing the biomass.</p>
<p id="p-0011" num="0010">In some embodiments, the method does not include or depend on depuration or purging to reduce off-flavor. In other embodiments, the aquatic species is subsequently depurated or purged to further reduce off-flavor after providing biomass to the aquaculture system.</p>
<p id="p-0012" num="0011">In some embodiments of the method, the weight of the aquatic species is higher than when the aquatic species is grown under identical conditions in the absence of the biomass and is depurated or purged, or depurated or purged for a longer period of time, to reduce off-flavor. In some embodiments, higher retained aquatic species mass is retained with a shorter depuration or purging time to reduce off-flavor than when the aquatic species is grown under identical conditions in the absence of the microbial biomass. In some embodiments, the amount of time needed for depuration or purging to reduce off-flavor to a particular desirable or acceptable level is shorter for an aquatic species grown according to a method as described herein in which microbial biomass is provided, in comparison to the aquatic species grown under identical conditions but in the absence of the microbial biomass. In some embodiments, the lipid content of the aquatic species is reduced, in comparison to the lipid content of the aquatic species grown under identical conditions in the absence of the biomass.</p>
<p id="p-0013" num="0012">In some embodiments of the method, the rate of addition of the biomass to the aquatic production system is adjusted to minimize or avoid loss of weight or reduction of growth rate of the aquatic species, while optimizing the reduction of off-flavor.</p>
<p id="p-0014" num="0013">In some embodiments, the microorganism from which the biomass is derived is a bacterial species. For example, the bacterial species may be a methylotrophic bacterium, such as a <i>Methylobacterium </i>species, such as, but not limited to, <i>Methylobacterium extorquens</i>. The microorganism may be from the genus <i>Methylobacterium, Methylomonas, Methylobacter, Methylococcus, Methylosinus, Methylocyctis, Methylomicrobium, Methylophilus, Methylobacillus, Hyphomicrobium, Xanthobacter, Bacillus, Paracoccus, Nocardia, Arthrobacter, Rhodopseudomonas, Pseudomonas, Candida, Hansenula, Pichia, Torulopsis, Rhodotorula, Escherichia</i>, or <i>Saccharomyces</i>. In some embodiments, the microorganism is a methylotrophic bacterium from the genus <i>Methylobacterium, Methylomonas, Methylobacter. Methylococcus, Methylosinus, Methylocyctis, Methylomicrobium, Methylophilus</i>, or <i>Methylobacillus</i>, or a methylotrophic bacterium from any of the genera described herein.</p>
<p id="p-0015" num="0014">In some embodiments, the aquatic species is a vertebrate aquatic species, for example, a fish or reptile species. In some embodiments, the aquatic species is an invertebrate aquatic species, for example, a shrimp or mollusk species.</p>
<p id="p-0016" num="0015">In some embodiments, the method provides modulated taste sensation, and the aquatic species, e.g., an edible tissue of the aquatic species, provides one or more improved taste test profile characteristic, as measured by a descriptive taste test panel, such as decreased off-flavor (e.g., &#x201c;muddy&#x201d; or &#x201c;musty&#x201d; flavor), in comparison to the aquatic species grown under identical conditions in the absence of the biomass.</p>
<p id="p-0017" num="0016">In another aspect, methods are provided for decreasing off-flavor in an aquatic species for human or animal consumption. The methods include providing an ingredient to an aquatic environment and/or to an aquatic species in an aquaculture production system through an aquatic feed. The ingredient may originate from terrestrial, marine or alternative sources including but not limited to insects, algae or microbes, for example, in the form of refined or unrefined biomass. Off-flavor is reduced in the aquatic species, e.g., in an edible tissue of the aquatic species, in comparison to the aquatic species grown under identical conditions in the absence of the ingredient (e.g., biomass). In some embodiments, the ingredient (e.g., biomass) does not mask off-flavor or alter the natural flavor of the aquatic species.</p>
<p id="p-0018" num="0017">In another aspect, an aquatic species, or one or more edible part or product thereof (for example, a fillet, eggs, etc.), is provided, wherein the aquatic species is produced by any of the methods described herein for decreasing off-flavor in an aquatic species for human or animal consumption. In some embodiments, the aquatic species, e.g., an edible tissue of the aquatic species, may provide one or more improved taste test profile characteristics, as measured by a descriptive taste test panel, in comparison to the aquatic species grown under identical conditions in the absence of the biomass. In some embodiments, the aquatic species e.g., an edible tissue of the aquatic species, includes a reduced level of 2-MIB and/or GSM, in comparison to the aquatic species grown under identical conditions in the absence of the biomass, e.g., in comparison to the same edible tissue of the aquatic species grown under identical conditions in the absence of the biomass.</p>
<p id="p-0019" num="0018">In another aspect, methods are provided for treating water to modulate the level of one or more off-flavor compounds. The methods include providing biomass derived from a microorganism (e.g., single cell protein, an extract thereof, or one or more biomolecule derived from the biomass) to an aqueous environment. The level of one or more off-flavor producing compounds is increased or decreased in the water of the aqueous environment, in comparison to water in an identical aqueous environment in the absence of the biomass, extract, or biomolecule(s). In some embodiments of the method, the one or more off-flavor producing compound that is modulated includes 2-MIB and/or GSM.</p>
<p id="p-0020" num="0019">In some embodiments, one or more biomolecules derived from a microorganism is provided to the aqueous environment, for example, one or more enzymes derived from microorganism or an enzyme preparation or formulation thereof.</p>
<p id="p-0021" num="0020">In some embodiments, the biomass is derived from microbial species, such as a methylotrophic bacterium, for example, a <i>Methylobacterium </i>species, such as, but not limited to, Methylobacterium extorquens. The microorganism may be from the genus <i>Methylobacterium, Methylomonas, Methylobacter, Methylococcus, Methylosinus, Methylocyctis, Methylomicrobium, Methylophilus, Methylobacillus, Hyphomicrobium, Xanthobacter, Bacillus, Paracoccus, Nocardia, Arthrobacter, Rhodopseudomonas, Pseudomonas, Candida, Hansenula, Pichia, Torulopsis, Rhodotorula, Escherichia</i>, or <i>Saccharomyces</i>. In some embodiments, the microorganism is a methylotrophic bacterium from the genus <i>Methylobacterium, Methylomonas, Methylobacter, Methylococcus, Methylosinus, Methylocyctis, Methylomicrobium, Methylophilus</i>, or <i>Methylobacillus</i>, or a methylotrophic bacterium from any of the genera described herein.</p>
<p id="p-0022" num="0021">In some embodiments, the aqueous environment may be an aquaculture production system, recycled water, wastewater treatment, or a municipal reservoir. The aqueous environment may be within an aquaculture production facility or may be a larger water treatment facility, such as a municipal water treatment facility.</p>

<p id="p-0028" num="0027">Unless defined otherwise herein, all technical and scientific terms used herein have the same meaning as commonly understood by one of ordinary skill in the art to which this invention belongs. Singleton, et al., Dictionary of Microbiology and Molecular Biology, second ed., John Wiley and Sons, New York (1994), and Hale &#x26; Markham, The Harper Collins Dictionary of Biology, Harper Perennial, NY (1991) provide one of skill with a general dictionary of many of the terms used in this invention. Any methods and materials similar or equivalent to those described herein can be used in the practice or testing of the present invention.</p>
<p id="p-0029" num="0028">The practice of the present invention will employ, unless otherwise indicated, conventional techniques of molecular biology (including recombinant techniques).</p>

Other elements may optionally be present other than the elements specifically identified by the &#x201c;and/or&#x201d; clause, whether related or unrelated to those elements specifically identified unless clearly indicated to the contrary. Thus, as a non-limiting example, a reference to &#x201c;A and/or B,&#x201d; when used in conjunction with open-ended language such as &#x201c;comprising&#x201d; can refer, in one embodiment, to A without B (optionally including elements other than B); in another embodiment, to B without A (optionally including elements other than A); in yet another embodiment, to both A and B (optionally including other elements); etc.&#x201d;</p>
<p id="p-0032" num="0031">An aquaculture feed is used in the production of an &#x201c;aquaculture product,&#x201d; wherein the product is a harvestable aquacultured species (e.g., finfish, crustaceans), which is often sold for human consumption. For example, salmon are intensively produced in aquaculture and thus are aquaculture products. Aquaculture feeds may also be used for organisms such as zooplankton like krill, rotifers, and the like, that are food sources for larger aquaculture organisms such as carnivorous fish. In addition, aquaculture feeds described herein can be used as feed for ornamental fish, shrimp, hobbyist aquaculture, and the like, that are not intended as food for other organisms.</p>
<p id="p-0033" num="0032">The term &#x201c;aquaculture product&#x201d; refers to food products intended for human consumption comprising any edible portion of an aquatic organism produced in an aquaculture operation as defined above. An aquaculture product may be, for example, a whole fish, a fillet cut from a fish, meat, skin, or fish eggs, each of which may be consumed as food. In some embodiments, such a product can be referred to as a fish or seafood product.</p>
<p id="p-0034" num="0033">The term &#x201c;biomass&#x201d; refers to microbial cellular material. Biomass may be produced naturally, or may be produced from the fermentation of a native host or a recombinant production host.

<p id="p-0038" num="0037">The term &#x201c;carotenoid&#x201d; is understood in the art to refer to a structurally diverse class of pigments derived from isoprenoid pathway intermediates. The commitment step in carotenoid biosynthesis is the formation of phytoene from geranylgeranyl pyrophosphate. Carotenoids can be acyclic or cyclic, and may or may not contain oxygen, so that the term carotenoids include both carotenes and xanthophylls. In general, carotenoids are hydrocarbon compounds having a conjugated polyene carbon skeleton formally derived from the five-carbon compound IPP, including triterpenes (C<sub>30 </sub>diapocarotenoids) and tetraterpenes (C<sub>40 </sub>carotenoids) as well as their oxygenated derivatives and other compounds that are, for example, C<sub>35</sub>, C<sub>50</sub>, C<sub>60</sub>, C<sub>70</sub>, C<sub>80 </sub>in length or other lengths. Many carotenoids have strong light absorbing properties and may range in length in excess of C<sub>2</sub>oo-C<sub>3</sub>o diapocarotenoids typically consist of six isoprenoid units joined in such a manner that the arrangement of isoprenoid units is reversed at the center of the molecule so that the two central methyl groups are in a 1,6-positional relationship and the remaining non-terminal methyl groups are in a 1,5-positional relationship. Such C<sub>3</sub>o carotenoids may be formally derived from the acyclic C<sub>3</sub>oH<sub>42 </sub>structure, having a long central chain of conjugated double bonds, by: (i) hydrogenation (ii) dehydrogenation, (iii) cyclization, (iv) oxidation, (v) esterification/glycosylation, or any combination of these processes. C<sub>40 </sub>carotenoids typically consist of eight isoprenoid units joined in such a manner that the arrangement of isoprenoid units is reversed at the center of the molecule so that the two central methyl groups are in a 1,6-positional relationship and the remaining non-terminal methyl groups are in a 1,5-positional relationship. Such C<sub>40 </sub>carotenoids may be formally derived from the acyclic C<sub>40</sub>H<sub>56 </sub>structure, having a long central chain of conjugated double bonds, by (i) hydrogenation, (ii) dehydrogenation, (iii) cyclization, (iv) oxidation, (v) esterification/glycosylation, or any combination of these processes. The class of C<sub>40 </sub>carotenoids also includes certain compounds that arise from rearrangements of the carbon skeleton, or by the (formal) removal of part of this structure. More than 600 different carotenoids have been identified in nature. Carotenoids include but are not limited to: antheraxanthin, adonirubin, adonixanthin, astaxanthin, canthaxanthin, capsorubrin, &#x3b2;-cryptoxanthin, a-carotene, &#x3b2;-carotene, &#x3b2;,&#x3a8;-carotene, &#x3b4;-carotene, &#x3f5;-carotene, echinenone, 3-hydroxyechinenone, 3&#x2032;-hydroxyechinenone, &#x3b3;-carotene, &#x3a8;-carotene, 4-keto-Y-carotene, &#x3b6;-carotene, a-cryptoxanthin, deoxyflexixanthin, diatoxanthin, 7,8-didehydroastaxanthin, didehydrolycopene, fucoxanthin, fucoxanthinol, isorenieratene, &#x3b2;-isorenieratene, lactucaxanthin, lutein, lycopene, myxobactone, neoxanthin, neurosporene, hydroxyneurosporene, peridinin, phytoene, rhodopin, rhodopin glucoside, 4-keto-rubixanthin, siphonaxanthin, spheroidene, spheroidenone, spirilloxanthin, torulene, 4-keto-torulene, 3-hydroxy-4-keto-torulene, uriolide, uriolide acetate, violaxanthin, zeaxanthin-&#x3b2;-diglucoside, zeaxanthin, and C30 carotenoids. Additionally, carotenoid compounds include derivatives of these molecules, which may include hydroxy-, methoxy-, oxo-, epoxy-, carboxy-, or aldehydic functional groups. Further, included carotenoid compounds include ester (e.g., glycoside ester, fatty acid ester) and sulfate derivatives (e.g., esterified xanthophylls).</p>

They are characterized by their cell envelopes, which are composed of a thin peptidoglycan cell wall sandwiched between an inner cytoplasmic cell membrane and a bacterial outer membrane. In contrast, Gram-positive bacteria such as most bacteria in the phyla Actinobacteria or Firmicutes retain crystal violet due to their relatively thicker peptidoglycan cell wall layer. In general, Gram-positive bacteria are monoderms and have a single lipid bilayer whereas Gram-negative bacteria are diderms and have two lipid bilayers. As used here &#x201c;Gram-negative bacteria&#x201d; refers to all bacteria except those in the phyla Actinobacteria, Firmicutes, or Tenericutes.

<heading id="h-0008" level="2">Methods for Reducing Off Flavor</heading>
<p id="p-0074" num="0073">Methods are provided for modulating, e.g., decreasing or eliminating, off-flavor, such as a &#x201c;muddy&#x201d; or unpleasant flavor, or increasing pleasant flavors in fish or seafood, in particular fish or seafood grown in an aqueous environment for aquaculture, such as an aquaculture production system. Microbial biomass is provided to an aqueous environment in which an aquatic species is grown. The biomass may be used as an ingredient which is included in a feed formulated for consumption by the aquatic species, or may be provided directly to the aqueous environment without formulation as a feed. The biomass may be, for example, in the form of single cell protein, a lysate, a hydrolysate, a homogenate, partially purified cellular material, an extract, or one or more biomolecule(s), such as, for example, one or more enzyme(s) or an enzyme preparation.</p>
<p id="p-0075" num="0074">Off-flavor is modulated or reduced in the aquatic species, in comparison to an aquatic species grown under identical conditions in the absence of the biomass. Off-flavor may be evaluated as taste perception by a descriptive taste test panel or an individual taster, and one or more taste profile characteristics may be improved, as scored by the panel or determined by an individual. In some embodiments, off-flavor is reduced in comparison to the same aquatic species grown under identical conditions with a traditional feed that does not contain the biomass. In some embodiments, the biomass that is provided to the aqueous environment, e.g., aquaculture system, does not mask off-flavor in the aquatic species.</p>
<p id="p-0076" num="0075">The aqueous environment may be any environment suitable for aquaculture, such as, but not limited to, a RAS, a partial RAS, a pond, a cage, or a flow through system, or any other environment in which aquatic species are produced for consumption.</p>
<p id="p-0077" num="0076">One or more off-flavor compounds may be modulated, resulting in reduction or elimination of off-flavor perceived or measured, in an aquatic species grown in the aquatic environment. The modulation of the off-flavor compound(s) results in an improved taste perception of the flavor of the aquatic species. For example, one or more off-flavor compounds may be decreased or increased, for example, by at least about 10 parts per trillion (ppt), in comparison to the same aquatic species grown in an identical aquatic environment in the absence of the biomass. In some embodiments, the concentration of 2-MIB and/or GSM is reduced, for example, by at least about 10 ppt, in the aquatic species, in comparison to the same aquatic species grown in an identical environment in the absence of the biomass.</p>
<p id="p-0078" num="0077">In some embodiments, the biomass is formulated into a feed, or provided as an addition to the aqueous environment. The biomass can be formulated into a finishing feed, where the aquatic species has been fed one or more different feed(s) prior to the introduction of the biomass (e.g., about the final 5-10% of growth time prior to harvesting of the aquatic species). The finishing feed is provided at the end of the growth cycle (e.g., about the final 5-10% of the growth cycle time frame) to reduce off-flavor and optionally to impart additional desired attributes to the aquatic species prior to harvesting. In other embodiments, the biomass may be formulated as a growout feed which is provided for the majority of the adult life of the aquatic species (e.g., about 85-90% of the growth cycle time frame). In other embodiments, the biomass can be fed prior to growout (e.g., a starter feed which is provided as an initial feed at the beginning of the life of the aquatic species (e.g., about the first 5% of growth cycle time frame). In some embodiments, the starter feed and/or growout feed may be a traditional feed such as a soy or fishmeal based feed.</p>
<p id="p-0079" num="0078">In some embodiments, the method does not include and does not depend on a depuration or purging step to reduce off-flavor. In some embodiments, the method includes depuration or purging after providing the biomass to the aquatic species, to further reduce off-flavor, i.e., to reduce off-flavor to a greater degree than is achieved by the biomass alone.</p>
<p id="p-0080" num="0079">In some embodiments, biomass is added to the aqueous environment, e.g., aquaculture production system, in the form of a feed ingredient or as an addition to the aqueous environment, at a rate that minimizes or avoids weight loss or reduced growth rate of the aquatic species, while optimizing or maximizing the reduction of off-flavor. Off-flavor may be reduced or eliminated in an aquatic species without significant loss of weight, in comparison to the same aquatic species that has been grown without addition of the biomass and then depurated or purged to reduce off-flavor.</p>
<p id="p-0081" num="0080">In some embodiments of the method, lipid content of the aquatic species is reduced, in comparison to the same aquatic species grown in an identical aquatic environment in the absence of the biomass.</p>
<p id="p-0082" num="0081">The aquatic species may be a vertebrate or invertebrate aquatic species. For example, vertebrate aquatic species may include fish, such as, but not limited to, salmon, barramundi, branzino, and trout. Vertebrate aquatic species may also include reptiles such as turtles and alligators. For example, invertebrate aquatic species may include, but are not limited to, crustacean (e.g., shrimps and crabs) and mollusks.</p>
<p id="p-0083" num="0082">In some embodiments, consumption of the microbial biomass as described herein results in a microbiome shift within the aquatic species. For example, the microbiome shift may be within a microbial community that emits one or more off-flavor compound, such as, but not limited to, cyanobacteria or actinomycetes. In some embodiments, the microbiome shift includes reduction in the relative amount of one or more off-flavor compound emitting microbe within the microbiome of the aquatic species, such as, but not limited to, reduction of one or more cyanobacteria and/or actinomycetes species or strain, in comparison to an identical aquatic species that has not consumed the microbial biomass as described herein.</p>
<p id="p-0084" num="0083">Methods are also provided for treating water to modulate, e.g., decrease or eliminate, off-flavor. Microbial biomass is provided to an aqueous environment, thereby modulating off-flavor. The biomass may be, for example, in the form of single cell protein, a lysate, a hydrolysate, a homogenate, partially purified cellular material, an extract, or one or more biomolecule(s), such as, for example, one or more enzyme(s) or an enzyme preparation. The level of one or more off-flavor producing compound is increased or decreased, in comparison to an identical aqueous environment in the absence of the microbial biomass. The aqueous environment may be, for example, an aquaculture production system, recycled water, waste water, or a municipal reservoir. The aqueous environment may be at the level of a large water treatment facility, such as a municipal water treatment facility, or at the level of a water treatment system within an aquaculture farm. In some embodiments, the aqueous environment is a municipal water treatment facility, wherein microbial biomass as described herein is added to reduce or eliminate one or more off-flavor producing compound, such as, for example, 2-MIB and/or GSM. In other embodiments, the aqueous environment is water within an aquaculture system such as a RAS, a partial RAS, a pond, a cage, or a flow through system, wherein microbial biomass as described herein is added to reduce or eliminate one or more off-flavor producing compound, such as, for example, 2-MIB and/or GSM.</p>
<p id="p-0085" num="0084">One or more off-flavor compounds may be modulated in the aqueous environment, resulting in reduction or elimination of off-flavor in water in the environment. The modulation of the off-flavor compound(s) results in an improved taste perception of the flavor of the water or in the edible tissues of an aquatic species grown in the aqueous environment. Off-flavor may be evaluated as taste perception by a descriptive taste test panel or an individual taster, and one or more taste profile characteristics may be improved, as scored by the panel or determined by an individual. For example, one or more off-flavor compounds may be decreased or increased, for example, by at least about 10 ppt, in comparison to the same aquatic species grown in an identical aquatic environment in the absence of the biomass. In some embodiments, the concentration of 2-MIB and/or GSM is reduced, for example, by at least about 10 ppt, in the aqueous environment or in an aquatic species grown in the environment, in comparison to in an identical aqueous environment in the absence of the biomass.</p>
<p id="p-0086" num="0085">In some embodiments, drinking water may be produced from the aqueous environment in which off-flavor is reduced or eliminated, in comparison to drinking water produced from an identical aqueous environment to which the biomass has not been provided. For example, the drinking water may have a reduced level of 2-MIB and/or GSM, e.g., a reduction of at least about 10 ppt, in comparison to drinking water produced from an identical aqueous environment to which the biomass has not been provided.</p>

<p id="p-0101" num="0100">In some embodiments, microbial biomass is incorporated into a feed product, such as a feed for one or more aquatic species. In certain embodiments, biomass that is incorporated into a feed or nutritional supplement can be in a dry, or substantially dry, form, e.g., containing less than about 20%, 10%, 5%, or 2% of moisture. In certain embodiments, the cultures are isolated by removing substantially all supernatant, such as by filtering, sedimentation, or centrifugation. In certain embodiments, the collection of cultures and further processing of biomass excludes a bacterial lysis step, e.g., by use of detergents or ultrasound. In certain embodiments, the processed microbial cells maintain substantially whole cell membranes (single cell protein). In some embodiments, a portion or a substantial portion (e.g., up to about 1%, 5%, 10%, 20%, 30%, 50%, or 80%, or more than about 1%, 5%, 10%, 20%, 30%, 50%, or 80%) of bacterial cells may maintain viability in the processed biomass.

<p id="p-0106" num="0105">In the methods described herein, off-flavor is reduced or eliminated in an aquatic species and/or in an aqueous environment. Off-flavor is often produced by microbes such as cyanobacteria or actinomycetes. The disclosed methods mitigate or eliminate off-flavor by including biomass (e.g., single cell protein, or a lysate, extract, or biomolecule(s) derived therefrom) in an aqueous environment or in feed that is fed to an aquatic species. Off-flavor compounds can be increased or decreased to mitigate or eliminate off-flavor. In some embodiments, reduction or elimination of off-flavor is a consequence of a shift in the microbiome of the aquatic species, such as, for example, a shift in the level or prevalence of one or more cyanobacteria or actinomycetes species or strain in the microbiome of the aquatic species.</p>

These aquatic species grown on KBM diet contained a notable decrease in off-flavor, when evaluated in a blind, randomized taste test.</p>
<p id="p-0111" num="0110">RAS-grown barramundi, trout, and shrimp fed diets containing KBM appeared to have an improved taste profile in small blind taste testing panels, in comparison to the same species fed a control diet commonly accepted by those skilled in the art to be commercially relevant or practical diets, even without depuration. Specifically regarding barramundi, a 2&#xd7;2 matrix of samples were prepared for tasting between KBM-feed and non-KBM feed, as well purged versus non-purged. Fillets were grilled with no seasoning and blindly evaluated by &#x2dc;6 panelists. In each case, KBM fed fish performed similarly or better to purged fish with regards to taste and preference.</p>
<p id="p-0112" num="0111">Trout fillets from fish fed the KBM and control diets were analyzed for levels of <b>2</b>-MIB and GSM utilizing a method similar to the method described at https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/10563866.

<p id="p-0113" num="0112">Two populations of fish (100 per condition in each species) are separated from each other in a single RAS tank to assure similar exposure to GSM/2-MIB. One population receives a control diet based on fish and plant-proteins, while the other population receives a diet where a plant protein has been replaced isonitrogenously with KBM. Each population is fed its respective experimental diet and grown to harvest size (1 kg). At this point, 20 fish from each population are sampled immediately before, and at the end of, a 5-day depuration period. Water samples are also sampled at regular intervals during growth for GSM and 2-MIB measurements.</p>
<p id="p-0114" num="0113">Fish are euthanized by ice immersion, weighed, fillets removed, and frozen at &#x2212;20&#xb0; C. All fish are randomly numbered at the time of harvest to allow for correlations between weight and flavor and to remove human bias.</p>
<heading id="h-0014" level="2">Sensory Assessment of Fillets and Off Flavor Analytics</heading>
<p id="p-0115" num="0114">A double-blind study is performed to determine flavor profiles of the fish fillets, using methods described by Percival, S., et al. (2008) <i>Aquaculture </i>284:136-143. and Jones, B., et al. (2013) <i>Aquaculture Environment Interactions </i>3:117-124. Assessments are performed by both trained and non-trained sensory panels for each growth trial in each species to ensure robust results. Non-trained panelists are asked to score acceptability using hedonic scaling for likeability, while the trained panelists score samples for specific attributes such as appearance, flavor, or texture (Percival, supra). Attributes also include &#x201c;muddiness,&#x201d; representing perception of GSM/2-MIB.</p>
