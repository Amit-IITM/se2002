<p id="p-0002" num="0001">This Patent application claims priority to U.S. Provisional Patent Application Ser. No. 63/301,004, filed Jan. 19, 2022, the content of which is hereby incorporated by reference herein in its entirety into this disclosure.</p>
<?cross-reference-to-related-applications description="Cross Reference To Related Applications" end="tail"?>
<?summary-of-invention description="Summary of Invention" end="lead"?>
<heading id="h-0001" level="1">TECHNICAL FIELD</heading>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">The subject disclosure relates generally to bottle warmers with adapters. More particularly, the present disclosure relates to bottle warming apparatus having adapters that securely fasten to various types of bottles.</p>
<heading id="h-0002" level="1">BACKGROUND</heading>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">Warming up breast milk or formula is one of the most commonly performed actions of a parent or caretaker. The purpose of warming up the milk before providing to an infant or toddler is to ensure that the temperature of the milk is as close to natural temperature as possible. It is common for infants or toddlers to have reflux when the temperature of the milk is too cold. Alternatively, if the temperature of the milk is too hot, the infant or toddler may be burned.</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">Conventional bottle warmers include a water chamber which serves as a bath for which a bottle of formula or milk is placed therein for a given period of time. However, such conventional bath-like bottle warmers tend to corrode from the long time exposure to the water, and may become a cesspool for bacterial growth, which can then be transferred to the bottle and/or attached nipple, which are placed therein. Such harmful contact with bacteria could potentially harm the infant or toddler that uses a bottle that has been heated in conventional bath-like bottle warmers.</p>
<heading id="h-0003" level="1">SUMMARY</heading>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">The present subject disclosure describes a bottle warmer having a base portion with a threaded top which can attach directly to a bottle. Alternatively, any number of adapters may be used which attach the base portion with any number of bottles from different manufacturers. The bottle warmer adapter may be shaped like a cylindrical sleeve having a first end and a second end. The adapter has a first skirt portion with a larger diameter at the first end, and a second skirt portion with a smaller diameter at the second end. Two fasteners are located on the adapter; one on the outer wall of the second skirt portion and one on the inner wall of the second skirt portion. An inward ledge is formed from a concave fillet extending from the second end towards the first end. The adapter contains a base seal to create a watertight seal between the adapter and another object. The adapter contains a bottle seal, situated on the ledge, to create a watertight seal between the adapter and a bottle.</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">In one exemplary embodiment, the present subject disclosure is a bottle warmer. The bottle warmer includes a base housing having an internal heating element, and an open top chamber with a threaded interior which is adapted to mate with an inverted bottle or an adapter; a circular channel positioned at a base portion of the top chamber; and a circular base seal adapted to fit within the channel and create a leak-proof barrier with a bottle or an adapter attached to the top chamber, the base seal having pull tab to facilitate removal from the circular channel.</p>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">In another exemplary embodiment, the present subject disclosure is a bottle warmer. The bottle warmer includes a base housing having an internal heating element, and an open top chamber with a threaded interior which is adapted to mate with an inverted bottle or an adapter; a circular channel positioned at a base portion of the top chamber; a circular base seal adapted to fit within the channel and create a leak-proof barrier with a bottle or an adapter attached to the top chamber, the base seal having pull tab to facilitate removal from the circular channel; and an adapter having a first skirt portion and a second skirt portion, wherein the first skirt portion has a threaded interior wall which is adapted to mate with the threaded portion of a bottle, and the second skirt portion has a threaded exterior wall which is adapted to mate with the threaded interior of the top chamber.</p>
<p id="p-0009" num="0008">In yet another exemplary embodiment, the present subject disclosure is a bottle warmer. The bottle warmer includes a base housing having an internal heating element, and an open top chamber with a threaded interior which is adapted to mate with an inverted bottle or an adapter; a circular channel positioned at a base portion of the top chamber; a circular base seal adapted to fit within the channel and create a leak-proof barrier with a bottle or an adapter attached to the top chamber, the base seal having pull tab to facilitate removal from the circular channel; and an adapter having a first skirt portion and a second skirt portion, wherein the first skirt portion has a threaded interior wall which is adapted to mate with the threaded portion of a bottle, and the second skirt portion has a threaded exterior wall which is adapted to mate with the threaded interior of the top chamber.</p>

<p id="p-0039" num="0038">Particular embodiments of a bottle warmer with adapter will now be described in greater detail with reference to the figures.</p>
<p id="p-0040" num="0039"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>1</b>A and <b>1</b>B</figref> show a bottle warmer assembly <b>10</b> in both connected (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b>A</figref>) and exploded (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b>B</figref>) configurations. The bottle warmer assembly <b>10</b> includes a base housing <b>20</b>, a base seal <b>30</b>, an adapter <b>100</b>, a bottle seal <b>40</b> and a bottle <b>50</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0041" num="0040"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref> shows the base <b>20</b>. The base <b>20</b> may include a heating element <b>29</b> for heating the bottle <b>50</b> and a liquid contained in the bottle <b>50</b>. The top <b>23</b> of the base <b>20</b> may contain a radial chamber <b>22</b> that is U-shaped and having a surface <b>21</b> that is heated. The surface <b>21</b> may be made of metal but may be made with any other material that is capable of conducting heat and can withstand high temperatures. The surface <b>21</b> may be heated, and as a result, the liquid contained in the bottle <b>50</b> that comes into contact with the surface <b>21</b> is heated as well.</p>
<p id="p-0042" num="0041"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>1</b>C-<b>1</b>H</figref> show a simplified sequential series of steps that may be followed to operate the warmer assembly <b>10</b>. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b>C</figref> indicates that the proper fitting adapter <b>100</b> should be selected which corresponds to the particular bottle <b>50</b> that is to be used to heat up a fluid. Once the proper adapter <b>100</b> is selected, the proper base seal <b>30</b> and corresponding bottle seal <b>40</b> are placed in series as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b>C</figref>. The base seal <b>30</b> and bottle seal <b>40</b> may be marked with identifiers which correspond to the proper adapter <b>100</b> and facilitate the assembly process. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b>D</figref> shows the step of filling the bottle <b>50</b> with fluid, which may be water, breast milk, juices, or other fluids, which ideally would be cold to room temperature. Step <b>1</b>E shows that once the bottle <b>50</b> is filled with the desired amount of cold fluid, the assembled base <b>20</b> from <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b>C</figref> is then inverted and placed on top of the bottle <b>50</b>. Since the adapter <b>100</b> has already been fastened to the base <b>20</b> as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b>C</figref>, the only action needed at <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b>E</figref> is to fasten the adapter <b>100</b> to the open end of the bottle <b>50</b>. Once the base <b>20</b> is fastened to the bottle <b>50</b> such that the cold fluid does not leak out, the assembly is inverted so that the bottle <b>50</b> is on the top. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b>F</figref> shows the assembled bottle <b>50</b> to the base <b>20</b> via the adapter <b>100</b>. This is the step where the heating element <b>29</b> (see <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref>) within the base <b>20</b> is activated to cause the fluid within the bottle <b>50</b> to become heated up, as will be described in more detail below. The amount of time needed to heat the cold fluid to a desired temperature may be based on time or temperature sensors (not shown) within the base that measure the temperature of the heating element <b>29</b> or the cold fluid within the bottle <b>50</b>. Once the fluid within the bottle <b>50</b> is heated up, the assembled bottle <b>50</b> to base <b>20</b> configuration of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b>F</figref> is again inverted so that the bottle <b>50</b> is on the bottom and the base <b>20</b> is on top. The base <b>20</b> is then detached from the bottle <b>50</b>, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b>G</figref>. The base <b>20</b>, adapter <b>100</b>, base seal <b>30</b>, and bottle seal <b>40</b> may then be cleaned and stored away. The heated fluid within the bottle <b>50</b> is now ready for use, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b>H</figref>. A nipple top (not shown) may be attached to the bottle <b>50</b> so that the bottle is ready for us, or the heated fluid within the bottle <b>50</b> may be poured into another container as desired to use.</p>
<p id="p-0043" num="0042">Although the series of steps shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>1</b>C-<b>1</b>H</figref> may be the most common use of the warmer assembly, according to the present subject disclosure, other methods may also be used. For example, some bottles <b>50</b> may not need an adapter <b>100</b>, and may be attached directly to the base <b>20</b>. Also, multiple bottles <b>50</b> may be heated up in one series without having to wash or rinse the adapter <b>100</b> and corresponding seals, <b>30</b> and <b>40</b>. Other methods are also possible and within the purview of one having ordinary skill in the art after consideration of the present description and accompanying drawings.</p>
<p id="p-0044" num="0043">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref>, the chamber <b>22</b> may contain fasteners <b>28</b> along radial walls <b>25</b> in order to secure an adapter <b>100</b> within the chamber <b>22</b>. The fasteners <b>28</b> may be, for example, female threads, grooves, a friction fit, and/or any other sort of securing mechanism that will securely fasten the adapter <b>100</b> to the base <b>20</b>. Alternatively, the fastener <b>28</b> may be embodied as male fasteners or threads to accommodate an adapter <b>100</b> with female fasteners or threads.</p>
<p id="p-0045" num="0044">The transfer of heat from the heating element <b>29</b> and to and between the surface <b>21</b> and the adapter <b>100</b> is designed to be at an optimal temperature at the surface <b>21</b> so that the liquid in the bottle <b>50</b> does not exceed 100 degrees Fahrenheit. A digital display <b>35</b> and on/off button <b>36</b> assist in the operation of the base <b>20</b>. The digital display <b>35</b> indicates the temperature of the heating element <b>29</b>. A source of power (not shown) may be direct and/or alternating current. The base of the chamber <b>22</b> contains a circular ring-like channel <b>24</b>. As show in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>2</b> and <b>16</b></figref>, an outer diameter <b>27</b> of the ring-like channel <b>24</b> is substantially flush with the radial walls <b>25</b> within the chamber <b>22</b>. The distance between the outer diameter <b>27</b> and an inner diameter <b>26</b> of the channel <b>24</b> is large enough to securely accommodate a base seal <b>30</b> within the channel <b>24</b>. The surface <b>21</b> at the bottom of the chamber <b>22</b> extends above the channel <b>24</b> to encapsulate the base seal <b>30</b>. The base seal <b>30</b> ensures that a water-tight seal is created between the adapter <b>100</b> and the base <b>20</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0046" num="0045">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref>, The base seal <b>30</b> is a circular flat ring made of a nonporous pliable material such as, for example, silicon, soft plastic, rubber, or any other suitable material capable of creating a watertight seal between the adapter <b>100</b> and the base <b>20</b>. An outer diameter <b>33</b> of the base seal <b>30</b> is substantially similar to the outer diameter <b>27</b> of the channel <b>24</b> on the base <b>20</b> (see <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref>). An inner diameter <b>32</b> of the base seal <b>30</b> is substantially similar to the inner diameter <b>26</b> of the channel <b>24</b>. The base seal <b>30</b> contains a pull tab <b>31</b> extending from the inner diameter <b>32</b> of the base seal <b>30</b>. Alternatively, the pull tab <b>31</b> can be located on the outer diameter <b>33</b> of the base seal <b>30</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0047" num="0046">Indicia (not shown) may be disposed on the pull tab <b>31</b>. The indicia may contain letters, numbers, or symbols. The indica allows the user to differentiate between the base seal <b>30</b> and the bottle seal <b>40</b>. The indicia also allows a user to identify and differentiate various other base seals that are adapted to fit other bottle warmers.</p>
<p id="p-0048" num="0047">The pull tab <b>31</b> extends inwardly at an upward angle relative to the base seal <b>30</b>. The pull tab <b>31</b> is provided to allow a user to easily remove the base seal <b>30</b> from within the channel <b>24</b> (see <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref>). As a result, the base seal <b>30</b> rests securely in the channel <b>24</b> and the pull tab <b>31</b> extends at an angle out of the channel <b>24</b>. The upward angle on the pull tab <b>31</b> allows the base seal <b>30</b> to rest in the channel <b>24</b> without being displaced by the pull tab <b>31</b>. The base seal <b>30</b> rests in the channel <b>24</b> located at the bottom of the chamber <b>22</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0049" num="0048">Continuing in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref>, a second end <b>102</b> of the adapter <b>100</b> (shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>10</b>A and <b>10</b>B</figref>) presses against the base seal <b>30</b>, creating a watertight seal, when the adapter <b>100</b> is secured to the base <b>20</b>. In position, an entire surface area <b>119</b> of the second end <b>102</b> will be in contact with, and substantially in between, the inner diameter <b>32</b> and outer diameter <b>33</b> of the base seal <b>30</b>.</p>

The outer radial ledge <b>113</b> is located a predetermined distance from the first end <b>101</b>. The outer radial ledge <b>113</b> may be large enough to cover the heated surface <b>21</b> surrounding the chamber <b>22</b>. Alternatively, the outer radial ledge <b>113</b> may be larger or smaller.</p>
<p id="p-0071" num="0070"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>22</b>-<b>23</b></figref> show a fourth embodiment of the adapter <b>400</b>. In this embodiment, the inner diameter <b>115</b> of the first end <b>101</b> of the adapter <b>100</b> is substantially similar to the diameter at the open end <b>52</b> of the bottle <b>50</b>. The first interior wall <b>107</b> contains fasteners to secure the bottle <b>50</b> to the adapter <b>400</b>. The outer diameter <b>116</b> of the first end <b>101</b> is smaller than the outer diameter <b>118</b> of the second end <b>102</b>. The first skirt portion <b>103</b> extends from the first end <b>101</b> in a direction towards the second end <b>102</b> and connects to the second skirt portion <b>104</b> at a shoulder <b>120</b>. Alternatively, the first skirt <b>103</b> portion may be flush with the second skirt portion <b>104</b>. In addition, the outer ledge <b>113</b> radially surrounds the adapter <b>400</b> along the first exterior wall <b>108</b>. The outer ledge <b>113</b> is located a predetermined distance from the first end <b>101</b>. The outer ledge <b>113</b> may be large enough to cover the heated surface <b>21</b> surrounding the chamber <b>22</b>. Alternatively, the diameter of the outer ledge <b>113</b> may be larger or smaller. An exterior radial skirt <b>114</b> extends perpendicularly from the outer ledge <b>113</b> in a direction towards the first end <b>101</b>. As a result, a channel <b>112</b> is created between the exterior radial skirt <b>114</b> and the first skirt <b>103</b>. The radial skirt <b>114</b> provides additional leverage to a user to be able to handle the adapter better during use and handling.</p>
<p id="p-0072" num="0071">The embodiments mentioned above can have varying differences that may allow for easier use or alternate uses. For example, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>24</b></figref> shows a fifth embodiment of the adapter <b>500</b>. The fourth embodiment of the adapter <b>400</b> and the fifth embodiment only differ in the size of the first skirt portion <b>103</b>. In the fifth embodiment, the first skirt portion <b>103</b> is shorter than the exterior skirt <b>114</b>. This allows for a cap <b>123</b> to be placed within the first end <b>101</b> of the adapter <b>500</b>. The cap <b>123</b> allows for a more finished adapter configuration with no exposed channel <b>112</b>.</p>
