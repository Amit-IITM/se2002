<heading id="h-0001" level="1">TECHNICAL FIELD</heading>
<p id="p-0002" num="0001">The present disclosure relates to a blender. More particularly, the present disclosure relates to a blender in which a main body operates when the closure of a container lid of a container body is detected.</p>
<heading id="h-0002" level="1">BACKGROUND ART</heading>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">Generally, a blender is a household appliance which chops or crushes food received in a container body by blades rotated by an electric motor, and is also commonly referred to as a food mixer.</p>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">In such a blender, the container body is seated on the upper surface of a main body in which the motor is provided, and when the container body is seated, the blades provided in the container body are connected to a rotating shaft of the motor to be rotatable.</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">After a user puts food in the container body through an open portion of the container body and closes a container lid thereof, the user operates the motor by manipulating the main body to rotate the blades such that the food is crushed.</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">The container lid closes the open portion of the container body to protect food inside the container body. It is a very important factor in the operation of a blender whether or not the container lid closes the open portion of the container body.</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">For safety during the operation of the blender, the blades are not rotated in a state in which the container lid does not close the container body. That is, to prevent accidents due to the blades, the blades are preferably allowed to be rotated only when the closure of the container lid on the container body is detected.</p>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">Conventionally, various methods of detecting the closure of a container lid have been proposed.</p>
<p id="p-0009" num="0008">For example, in the related art, a push rod physically connecting the container body with the blender body is provided, and when the container lid closes the container body, the container lid presses against the push rod. A press detection part of the main body detects the pressing of the container lid, and detects the closure of the container lid.</p>
<p id="p-0010" num="0009">However, the push rod and the press detection part are required to be separately installed, and the press detection part may be contaminated due to moisture or food that may enter the press detection part.</p>
<p id="p-0011" num="0010">In addition, the push rod of the container body and the press detection part of the main body are required to be installed at positions corresponding to each other, so there is a problem in that the container body is required to be mounted only in a specific direction.</p>
<p id="p-0012" num="0011">Additionally, the push rod is required to be installed along the container body in a longitudinal direction thereof from the container body to the main body, so the design of the container body made of a transparent material cannot be maintained.</p>
<p id="p-0013" num="0012">Recently, in order to solve this problem, a technique of detecting the closure of the container lid on the container body by the main body using wireless communication or electromagnetic coupling between the container body and the main body has been disclosed.</p>
<p id="p-0014" num="0013">For example, in European Patent No. EP2548485, when a container lid closes the container body, a blender detecting the closure of the container lid on the container body by the main body by using a wireless communication module is disclosed.</p>
<p id="p-0015" num="0014">However, in such a prior art, the wireless communication module is required, and a separate power supply is required to be provided in the container body so as to drive the wireless communication module.</p>
<p id="p-0016" num="0015">In another example, in US Patent Application Publication No. 20180020875, an interlocking blender is disclosed in which a transmitting coil and a receiving coil are disposed in the main body, and a receiving coil and a transmitting coil are disposed in the container body so as to correspond to the transmitting coil and receiving coil, respectively, and when a container lid closes the container body, power is transmitted to the receiving coil of the container body through the transmitting coil of the main body, and in turn, the power is transmitted to the receiving coil of the main body through the transmitting coil of the container body, so that the main body detects the closure of the container lid on the container body.</p>
<p id="p-0017" num="0016">However, in such a prior art, two coils, that is, a transmitting coil and a receiving coil, are required to be installed in each of the main body and the container body, and a device analyzing power received by the receiving coil of the main body is required.</p>
<p id="p-0018" num="0017">In addition, two coils are arranged in each of the main body and the container body, and when electric current flows through each coil, induced currents change due to interference between magnetic fields induced in the coils. Accordingly, it is difficult to accurately analyze power received by the receiving coil of the main body.</p>
<p id="p-0019" num="0018">Furthermore, power is transmitted from the transmitting coil of the main body to the receiving coil of the container body, and due to the closure of a container lid of the container body, the power is transmitted from the transmitting coil of the container body to the receiving coil of the main body. In order to allow the receiving coil of the main body to receive effective power, high power is required to be transmitted from the transmitting coil of the main body to the receiving coil of the container body.</p>
<p id="p-0020" num="0019">Additionally, to electrically connect a detection circuit for detecting the closure of the container lid on the container body with the main body, a conductive member is installed along the transparent container body, and thus the design of the transparent container body is spoiled.</p>

<heading id="h-0006" level="1">Technical Solution</heading>
<p id="p-0032" num="0034">In a blender of the present disclosure, through one-time inductive coupling between a first inductive coil mounted to a main body and a second inductive coil mounted to a container body, a light signal is transmitted/received between a light emitting unit installed in the container body and a light receiving unit installed in the main body.</p>
<p id="p-0033" num="0035">In the blender of the present disclosure, according to the closure of the container lid on the container body, inductive coupling between the first inductive coil and the second inductive coil of the container body may be performed.</p>
<p id="p-0034" num="0036">In the blender of the present disclosure, power may be generated in the second inductive coil by inductive coupling between the first inductive coil of the main body and the second inductive coil of the container body, and the light emitting unit transmits a light signal to the light receiving unit by using the generated power.</p>
<p id="p-0035" num="0037">In the blender of the present disclosure, by applying a voltage having a predetermined signal pattern to the first inductive coil of the main body, the voltage induced in the second inductive coil of the container body has the signal pattern, and the voltage of the signal pattern is supplied to the light emitting unit. Accordingly, the light emitting unit may transmit the light signal according to the signal pattern.</p>

<p id="p-0039" num="0041">In the blender of the present disclosure, the first, second, and third frequencies are 30-45 kHz, 0.5-5 kHz, and 350-450 kHz, respectively.</p>
<p id="p-0040" num="0042">In the blender of the present disclosure, the light receiving unit receives the light signal having the signal pattern, and the motor of the main body may be driven only when the light signal having the signal pattern is received by the light receiving unit.</p>
