<heading level="1" id="h-0001">FIELD OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0002" num="0001">The present invention generally relates to the field of aquatic product processing. More specifically the present invention relates to a low-loss-of-soup fish ball with fillings and the method of preparing the same.</p>
<heading level="1" id="h-0002">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">Fish ball with fillings, also known as bao-xin yu wan, has a broad market prospect, and it is favored by consumers for its fresh and juicy taste. When the product is heated and cooked, a small amount of soup in the filling will seep into the outer skin after a long period of frozen storage and circulation. The consequence is a certain degree of soup loss and a poor taste when re-cooked, which seriously affects the business development of the product and the economic benefits. Therefore, the urgent problems in the aquatic product processing industry are as follows: how to control and improve the quality of surimi products in the process of freezing and storing, how to reduce the loss-of-soup after long-term frozen storage, and how to maintain the juicy taste of surimi products. The addressed issue is very important for improving the quality and industrial efficiency of surimi products.</p>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">Conventionally, konjac gum, cortisol and carrageenan have been widely used as conditioners to improve the gel strength and quality of surimi products. However, they are all aimed at the quality changes of unfilled surimi products in freezing and storing. There are not many improvement methods in the field to control the loss of soup during freezing and reheating. It is well known that the fillings of the stuffed surimi product are having poor stability after repeated freezing and thawing. Since the oil-water migration problem is serious, it is necessary to enhance the water and oil resistance of the surimi gel through the directional regulation of the surimi gel. The development of the key technology of preservation and quality control of the stuffed surimi products may significantly improve the soup taste and other edible quality of the stuffed fish balls products.</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">Currently, the processing of the fish ball with fillings product is mainly based on the invention of processing technology and equipment for stuffed fish balls with various characteristics of fillings. No prior arts have disclosed the quality control technology of the cooked fish ball with fillings products after the freezing or thawing process. Therefore, the hydrocolloid combined with pre-emulsification technology may not only reduce the loss of soup in surimi products, but also provide a processing method that is easy-to-use and time-saving, and so forth improve the water and oil barrier performance of surimi gel.</p>
<heading level="1" id="h-0003">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading>

<p id="p-0143" num="0142">Frozen fish balls are cut in half and the fillings are scooped out. Determine the filling moisture. Take another frozen fish balls and boil them for 15 min, absorb the visible water and grease on the surface of the fish balls with absorbent paper, cut the fish balls in half and scoop out the filling, and measure the filling moisture. Each group of samples was measured 10 times in parallel. It was found that the main component of soup loss was water, and this method was used to assess the soup loss by the rate of water loss in the filling before and after steaming, and to simplify the calculation. The dry base content of the fish ball filling before and after steaming is constant. Soup loss rate is calculated according to the following formula.</p>

<p id="p-0153" num="0149">According to Table 1, the processed fish balls with fillings treated in the embodiments can significantly reduce the soup loss, with the single pre-emulsification <b>103</b> group (counter examples 1 to 3) being the second highest and the single group (counter examples 4 to 6) having the highest soup loss rate. 34.30% of the soup loss rate in the 0.4% cortisol pre-emulsification <b>103</b> group (counter example 2) was reduced by 25.52% relative to the control group (counter example 7), which is still lower than most of the embodiments. The soup loss of the fish balls (Embodiment 1) made by pre-emulsification <b>103</b> of curdlan and konjac gum in the ratio of 3:7 was reduced by 52.22% compared to the control group (counter example 7).</p>
<p id="p-0154" num="0150">Thus, although the soup loss rate of fish balls made by single emulsification group (counter examples 1 to 3) can be effectively improved, the effect of compound pre-emulsification <b>103</b> group (Embodiments 1 to 6) is better. This may be, on the one hand, due to the fact that konjac gum can synergize with carrageenan and curdlan, which in turn improves the quality of surimi gel. On the other hand, carrageenan, konjac gum and curdlan may have emulsified with the oil to form emulsified oil droplets with myosin in the surimi, and the emulsified oil droplets filled into the rougher gel network structure formed by myosin, making the structure more delicate and denser, thus reducing the loss of broth.</p>
<p id="p-0155" num="0151">The change in quality of the stuffed fish balls by pre-emulsification <b>103</b> is assessed according to hardness and elasticity. The stuffed fish balls of the compound pre-emulsification <b>103</b> group (Embodiments 1-6) had the highest hardness values, followed by the single pre-emulsification <b>103</b> group (counter examples 1 to 3) and the single group (counter examples 4 to 6) had the lowest hardness values. According to Table 2, the trend of soup loss rate and hardness variation are basically the same.</p>
<p id="p-0156" num="0152">As shown in Table 2, the addition of different hydrocolloids (counter examples 4~6) all had different degrees of effect on the hardness of the outer skin of fish balls. Among them, pair ratio 4 had the greatest effect on the surimi products. In addition to this, although the single group (counter examples 4~6) improved the hardness, elasticity to some extent, the single pre-emulsification <b>103</b> group (counter examples 1~3) is significantly better than the addition of single group (counter examples 4~6) in enhancing the outer cortical structure of fish balls.</p>
<p id="p-0157" num="0153">With the change of the ratio of konjac gum with carrageenan and curdlan compound, the hardness of the example of surimi products showed a trend of first increase and then decrease, compared with the counter examples, the examples have a higher hardness, elasticity, and significantly improve the quality of stuffed fish balls, indicating that within a certain degree, the hydrocolloid compound with surimi protein formed a more dense network structure, and there is a synergistic effect with starch.</p>
<p id="p-0158" num="0154">As can be seen from Table 1, the brightness of the group with the addition of carrageenan (counter example 3) and curdlan (counter example 2) was higher than that of the group with the addition of konjac gum (counter example 1), probably due to the fact that carrageenan fills the pores of the protein gel during the gelation of surimi, increasing the level of the gel and thus leading to a higher brightness of the surimi. Konjac gum itself is colorless and transparent, added to the surimi gel to improve the transparency of the composite gel, but to a certain extent reduces the brightness of the surimi gel. And the compounding of embodiments 1~6 not only reduces the juice loss, but also increases the brightness.</p>
<p id="p-0159" num="0155">The present invention provides a low soup loss frozen stuffed fish ball and its preparation method. The present invention adopts the technical solution of combining hydrocolloid and oil pre-emulsification <b>103</b> technology, which can effectively solve the taste of powdered, reduce the soup loss of fish balls after freeze-thaw cooking, reduce the soup loss rate of stuffed fish balls from 46.05% to 22.00%, and improve the juicy taste of frozen stuffed fish balls after freeze-thaw cooking. The use of konjac gum and carrageenan or curdlan respectively, combined with oil pre-emulsification <b>103</b> technology, can also effectively improve the texture and brightness of the outer skin of fish balls, compared with a single addition, its hardness increased by 11.38% ~ 42.23%, elasticity increased by 4.76% ~ 13.10%, brightness from 80.19 to 81.06, effectively solve the fish balls due to freeze-thaw cycle leading to loosed structure, brightness and other problems. It effectively solves the problems of loosening structure and decreasing brightness due to freeze-thaw cycle.</p>
<p id="p-0160" num="0156">The method of the invention is simple and easy to use, and can be realized in conventional fish ball production workshops without strict requirements. In addition, it can be widely applied to the current fish ball with fillings products, and can also be applied to other stuffed surimi and minced meat products.</p>
<p id="p-0161" num="0157">All or portions of the methods in accordance to the embodiments may be executed in one or more fish ball with fillings, surimi, and other processed aquatic food products.</p>
