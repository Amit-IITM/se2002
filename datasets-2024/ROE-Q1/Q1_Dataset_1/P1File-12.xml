<heading id="h-0002" level="1">FIELD OF THE DISCLOSURE</heading>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">This disclosure relates generally to a closure for a multi-layer garment, and specifically to a three-part clasp for a pumping garment including a shoulder strap, an inner layer, and an outer layer.</p>
<heading id="h-0003" level="1">BACKGROUND</heading>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">A nursing woman is able to provide breastmilk to an infant in two ways. First, the nursing woman can breastfeed the infant directly. Second, the nursing woman can use a breast pump to extract milk that can be stored and fed to the infant at a later time. A two-layer pumping garment may be worn by a nursing woman to facilitate these two activities. During nursing, both layers of the pumping garment may be partially disconnected at or near a shoulder strap to fully expose a breast for breastfeeding. During pumping, the outer layer may be partially disconnected to expose the connected inner layer, which may be configured to support a breast pumping apparatus. When neither nursing or pumping is occurring, both layers may be secured in place in order for the pumping garment to provide a normal appearance under clothing.</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">The current clasps used in two-layer pumping garments are four-part clasps that are complicated and confusing for a wearer. The existing clasps have two males parts and two female parts, resulting in two male/female connections per shoulder strap. A wearer must, while wearing the garment, determine where all four parts are located and must ascertain which female part goes with which male part. In some variations, all four parts are separate. In other variations, one male part and one female part may both be provided on a single clasp component. To disconnect an outer layer, the wearer must determine which of the two male/female connections to disconnect. In some variations, the outer layer cannot be connected directly to the shoulder strap without an intermediate clasp component. In other variations, a female part associated with an inner layer can be joined with the wrong male part such that the correct male part is hidden underneath fabric of the inner layer, resulting in confusion and frustration for the wearer. Despite these drawbacks, a one-to-one relationship between a male part and a female part of a clasp has been considered necessary in order to adequately secure both layers of a two-part garment.</p>
<heading id="h-0004" level="1">SUMMARY</heading>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">The present disclosure is directed to a three-part clasp that improves a wearer's experience in selectively removing or replacing layers of a two-layer garment. The three-part clasp has only one male part upon which two female parts are selectively secured, eliminating any confusion about which male part should join with which female part and any possibility of connecting the wrong male and female parts. The male part may be connected to a shoulder strap with each of the two female parts secured to one of the two layers of fabric. By being secured to the shoulder strap, any force acting upon the layers of fabric (such as the downward force of gravity upon a pumping apparatus supported by the inner layer) are transmitted more directly and distributed more quickly on the shoulder strap than if an intermediate clasp component were in use. For at least these reasons, the three-part clasp makes the two-layer garment more intuitive and straightforward for the wearer than known four-part clasps while simultaneously improving the two-layer garment's ability to support the weight of a pumping apparatus.</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">In accordance with an example, a three-part clasp for a pumping garment for hands-free pumping includes a male part, a first female part, and a second female part. The male part is attached to a shoulder strap of the pumping garment. The first female part is attached to an inner layer of the pumping garment, the inner layer including an aperture for insertion of a breast pump flange. The second female part is attached to an outer layer of the pumping garment. In a doubly fastened configuration, the first female part is connected to the male part, the second female part is connected to the male part, and the first female part and the second female part are arranged side-by-side.</p>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">In some forms, the male part may include a vertical base, a horizontal extension protruding outwardly from the vertical base to an end, and a vertical extension projecting upwardly from the end of the horizontal extension. The first female part may include a first opening adapted to selectively hang on the horizontal extension of the male part. The second female part may include a second opening adapted to selectively hang on the horizontal extension of the male part. The first female part may have a first width, the second female part may have a second width, and a distance between the vertical base and the vertical extension along the horizontal extension of the male part may be equal to or greater than the sum of the first width and the second width. The horizontal extension may protrude upwardly from the vertical base at an angle between 95 and 105 degrees. The first female part may include a protrusion to secure the first female part on the male part.</p>
<p id="p-0009" num="0008">In still further forms, the first female part may include an inner layer aperture, the second female part may include an outer layer aperture, and the inner layer aperture may be offset from the outer layer aperture in the doubly fastened configuration. The inner layer aperture may be located an offset distance below the outer layer aperture in the doubly fastened configuration. The offset distance may be greater than <b>7</b> millimeters.</p>
<p id="p-0010" num="0009">In some forms, the first opening may have a first internal perimeter, the second opening may have a second internal perimeter, and the first internal perimeter may be identical to the second internal perimeter. The first female part may include a first external perimeter including a first upper portion partially surrounding the first opening, and the second female part may include a second external perimeter including a second upper portion partially surrounding the second opening. The first upper portion may be identical to the second upper portion. The first female part may include a first depressed surface partially surrounding the first opening and a first raised surface surrounding the first depressed surface. The second female part may include a second depressed surface partially surrounding the second opening and a second raised surface surrounding the second depressed surface. The first depressed surface and the first raised surface may be complementary in size and shape to the second depressed surface and the second raised surface.</p>
<p id="p-0011" num="0010">In other forms, the first female part may include a first resilient tab adjacent the first opening, and the second female part may include a second resilient tab adjacent the second opening. The first resilient tab may be complementary in size and shape to the second resilient tab.</p>
<p id="p-0012" num="0011">In accordance with an example, a three-part clasp for a pumping garment for hands-free pumping includes a male part, a first female part, and a second female part. The male part is attached to a shoulder strap of the pumping garment. The first female part is attached to an inner layer of the pumping garment, the inner layer including an aperture for insertion of a breast pump flange. The second female part is attached to an outer layer of the pumping garment. In a doubly fastened configuration, the first female part is connected to the male part, the second female part is connected to the male part, and the second female part is configured to be stacked upon the first female part.</p>
<p id="p-0013" num="0012">In some forms, the male part may include a vertical base, a horizontal extension protruding outwardly from the vertical base to an end, and a vertical extension projecting upwardly from the end of the horizontal extension. The first female part may include a first opening adapted to selectively hang on the horizontal extension of the male part, and the second female part may include a second opening adapted to selectively engage the vertical extension of the male part. The first female part and the second female part may have a combined height when stacked in the doubly fastened configuration, and the vertical extension of the male part may have a height equal to or greater than the combined height.</p>
<p id="p-0014" num="0013">In additional forms, the first female part may include an inner layer aperture, the second female part may include an outer layer aperture, and the inner layer aperture may be offset from the outer layer aperture in the doubly fastened configuration. The inner layer aperture may be located a distance below the outer layer aperture in the doubly fastened configuration. The first female part may include a first resilient tab adjacent the first opening, and the second female part may include a second resilient tab adjacent the second opening. The horizontal extension may protrude upwardly from the vertical base at an angle between 95 and 105 degrees.</p>

A first female part <b>112</b> of the three-part clasp <b>100</b> is attached to the inner layer <b>108</b> and may be selectively connected to the male part <b>110</b>. A second female part <b>114</b> of the three-part clasp <b>100</b> is attached to the outer layer <b>109</b> and may also be selectively connected to the male part <b>100</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0044" num="0043"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>1</b> and <b>5</b></figref> show the three-part clasp <b>100</b> in an unfastened configuration. The unfastened configuration allows a wearer of the pumping garment <b>102</b> to pull down both the inner layer <b>108</b> and the outer layer <b>109</b> to expose a breast for breastfeeding an infant directly. In the unfastened configuration, the male part <b>110</b> of the three-part clasp <b>100</b> is not connected to either the first female part <b>112</b> or the second female part <b>114</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0045" num="0044"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>2</b> and <b>6</b></figref> show the three-part clasp <b>100</b> in a singly fastened configuration. The singly fastened configuration allows a wearer of the pumping garment <b>102</b> to attach the inner layer <b>108</b> to the shoulder strap <b>104</b> via a connection between the first female part <b>112</b> and the male part <b>110</b> of the three-part clasp <b>100</b>. The inner layer <b>108</b> may, for example, be designed with an aperture <b>116</b> over a nipple area in order to hold a breast shield or other pumping apparatus in place, allowing the wearer of the garment to pump breastmilk hands-free. In the singly fastened configuration, the male part <b>110</b> of the three-part clasp <b>100</b> is not connected to the second female part <b>114</b>, which allows the outer layer <b>109</b> to be pulled down to expose the inner layer <b>108</b> in order to, for example, facilitate breast pumping.</p>
<p id="p-0046" num="0045"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>3</b> and <b>7</b></figref> show the three-part clasp <b>100</b> in a doubly fastened configuration. The doubly fastened configuration allows a wearer of the pumping garment <b>102</b> to attach the outer layer <b>109</b> to the shoulder strap <b>104</b> via a connection between the second female part <b>114</b> and the male part <b>110</b> of the three-part clasp <b>100</b>. The outer layer <b>109</b> then covers the inner layer <b>108</b>, and the first female part <b>112</b> and the second female part <b>114</b> are both independently connected to the male part <b>110</b> of the three-part clasp <b>100</b>. The outer layer <b>109</b> may be designed to cover a wearer's breast in a manner similar to a typical bra or bra-style camisole. After pumping or breastfeeding, a wearer may opt for the doubly fastened configuration in order to wear the pumping garment <b>102</b> in a manner that achieves the same coverage and support as a standard bra or camisole.</p>
<p id="p-0047" num="0046">The three-part clasp <b>100</b> is shown as having two arrangements: a side-by-side arrangement (shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>1</b>-<b>4</b>G</figref>) and a stacked arrangement (shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>5</b>-<b>8</b>G</figref>). In the side-by-side arrangement, best shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b>A</figref>, the first female part <b>112</b> and the second female part <b>114</b> are arranged next to one another on the male part <b>110</b>. Specifically, the male part <b>110</b> includes a horizontal extension <b>118</b>, a vertical extension <b>120</b>, and a vertical base <b>122</b>. The first female part <b>112</b> has an first opening <b>124</b> that allows the first female part <b>112</b> to hang from the horizontal extension <b>118</b>. The second female part <b>114</b> has an second opening <b>126</b> that allows the second female part <b>114</b> to hang from the horizontal extension <b>118</b>. The horizontal extension <b>118</b> is sufficiently long to accommodate the width of both of the first female part <b>112</b> and the second female part <b>114</b> when they are arranged adjacent or nearly adjacent one another. In particular, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b>A</figref>, the first female part <b>112</b> has a first width W<b>1</b>, the second female part has a second width W<b>2</b>, and a distance D between the vertical extension <b>120</b> and the vertical base <b>122</b> along the horizontal extension <b>118</b> is equal to or greater than the sum of the first width W<b>1</b> and the second width W<b>2</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0048" num="0047">In the stacked arrangement, best shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>8</b>A</figref>, the first female part <b>112</b> is positioned below the second female part <b>114</b>. The first opening <b>124</b> of the first female part <b>112</b> allows the first female part <b>112</b> to hang from the horizontal extension <b>118</b> of the male part <b>110</b>. The second opening <b>126</b> of the second female part <b>114</b> allows the second female part <b>114</b> to be hooked over the vertical extension <b>120</b> of the male part <b>110</b>. The second female part <b>114</b> then stacks on top of the first female part <b>112</b>. The height of the horizontal extension <b>118</b> of the male part <b>110</b> is sufficiently high to secure both the second female part <b>114</b> and the first female part <b>112</b> in the stacked configuration between the horizontal extension <b>118</b> and the vertical base <b>122</b> of the male part <b>110</b>. In particular, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>8</b>A</figref>, the first female part <b>112</b> has a first vertical height H<b>1</b> corresponding to the portion of the first female part <b>112</b> that occupies vertical space on the male part <b>110</b> in the stacked arrangement, and the second female part has a second vertical height H<b>2</b> corresponding to the portion of the second female part <b>114</b> that occupies vertical space on the male part <b>110</b> in the stacked arrangement. Together, the first vertical height H<b>1</b> and the second vertical height H<b>2</b> form a combined height that is less than or equal to a height H<b>3</b> of the vertical extension <b>120</b> of the male part <b>110</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0049" num="0048">The three-part clasp <b>100</b> may have a number of features to facilitate use. For example, the first female part <b>112</b> and the second female part <b>114</b> may be sized and shaped to be complementary to one another or may have divots, protrusions, or other features to engage with one another. Similarly, the horizontal extension <b>118</b> or the vertical extension <b>120</b> of the male part <b>110</b> may have curvatures, divots, protrusions, or other features to help secure the first female part <b>112</b> and the second female part <b>114</b> in their respective locations.</p>
<p id="p-0050" num="0049"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>9</b>A-<b>9</b>D</figref> illustrate alternate or additional features of the first female part <b>112</b>, the second female part <b>114</b>, and the male part <b>110</b>. The elements illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>9</b>A-<b>9</b>D</figref> are designated by the same reference numbers indicated on the arrangements illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>1</b>-<b>8</b>G</figref>. Accordingly, features common to all figures will not be described in substantial detail. Further, it is appreciated that any combination or sub-combination of features described in regard to the first female part <b>112</b>, the second female part <b>114</b>, and the male part <b>110</b> in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>9</b>A-<b>9</b>D</figref> may be incorporated into the arrangements shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>1</b>-<b>8</b>G</figref>, and vice-versa.</p>
<p id="p-0051" num="0050">One issue addressed by the arrangements depicted in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>9</b>A-<b>9</b>D</figref> is that of undesirable movement of the first female part <b>112</b> in the singly fastened configuration. In the singly fastened configuration, the first female part <b>112</b> hangs on the horizontal extension <b>118</b> without the second female part <b>114</b>, and thus the first female part <b>112</b> has more space to move along the horizontal extension <b>118</b> in the singly fastened configuration than in the doubly fastened configuration. To limit the movement of the first female part <b>112</b> in the singly fastened configuration, the first female part <b>112</b> may be provided with teeth <b>132</b> that engage the male part <b>110</b> or the shoulder strap <b>104</b>. In particular, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>9</b>B-<b>9</b>D</figref>, the male part <b>110</b> includes a shoulder strap aperture <b>128</b> above the horizontal extension <b>118</b>. The first opening <b>124</b> of the first female part <b>112</b> is formed in part by a first cross-bar <b>130</b>. Teeth <b>132</b> are provided on the first cross-bar <b>130</b>. The teeth <b>132</b> extend at least partially through the shoulder strap aperture <b>128</b> when the first female part <b>112</b> selectively hangs on the horizontal extension <b>118</b> of the male part <b>110</b> adjacent to the vertical base <b>122</b> of the male part <b>110</b>. Specifically, the shoulder strap aperture <b>128</b> includes a bottom edge <b>134</b>, and the teeth <b>132</b> are configured to engage the bottom edge <b>134</b> when the first female part <b>112</b> selectively hangs on the horizontal extension <b>118</b> of the male part <b>110</b> adjacent to the vertical base <b>122</b> of the male part <b>110</b>. The engagement creates friction that optimally limits the movement of the first female part <b>112</b> in the singly fasted configuration. In other arrangements not depicted herein, the teeth <b>132</b> may be located elsewhere on the first female part <b>112</b> and may engage a different part of the male part <b>110</b> or may engage the shoulder strap <b>104</b>. The teeth <b>132</b> may take any shape or form, such as a protrusion, that desirably increases friction or engagement of the first female part <b>112</b> with the male part <b>110</b> or the shoulder strap <b>104</b> and thus limits movement of the first female part <b>112</b> in the singly fastened configuration.</p>
<p id="p-0052" num="0051">Another issue addressed by the arrangements depicted in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>9</b>A-<b>9</b>D</figref> is how to secure both the first female part <b>112</b> and the second female part <b>114</b> on the male part <b>110</b> in the doubly fastened configuration. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>9</b>D</figref>, the horizontal extension <b>118</b> of the male part <b>110</b> may protrude upwardly from the vertical base <b>122</b> at an angle A greater than 90 degrees and ideally between 95 and 105 degrees. The result of the angle A is that, when the first female part <b>112</b> and the second female part <b>114</b> hang on the horizontal extension <b>118</b>, gravity pulls the first female part <b>112</b> and the second female part <b>114</b> along the horizontal extension <b>118</b> toward the vertical base <b>122</b>. The first female part <b>112</b> and the second female part <b>114</b> are thus less likely to fall off the male part <b>110</b>. The horizontal extension <b>118</b> of the male part <b>110</b> in a stacked arrangement, such as that shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>8</b></figref>, may likewise protrude upwardly from the vertical base <b>122</b> at an angle A greater than 90 degrees and ideally between 95 and 105 degrees in order to secure the first female part <b>112</b> on the base in the singly fastened configuration.</p>
<p id="p-0053" num="0052">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>9</b>A and <b>9</b>B</figref>, the first female part <b>112</b> includes an inner layer aperture <b>136</b> to which the inner layer <b>108</b> is connected, and the second female part <b>114</b> includes an outer layer aperture <b>138</b> to which the outer layer <b>109</b> is connected. The inner layer <b>108</b> can create a bump or bulky area where it connects to the inner layer aperture <b>136</b>, and likewise the outer layer <b>109</b> can create a bump or bulky area where it connects to the outer layer aperture <b>138</b>. In addition to being unsightly under clothing when combined, overlapping the bump or bulky areas can interfere with the securement of the first female part <b>112</b> and the second female part <b>114</b> on the male part <b>110</b>. To avoid these issues, these bump or bulky areas are offset from one another by having the inner layer aperture <b>136</b> offset from the outer layer aperture <b>138</b> in the doubly fastened configuration. In particular, the inner layer aperture <b>136</b> is located an offset distance O below the outer layer aperture <b>138</b> in the doubly fastened configuration. In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>9</b>B</figref>, the location of a bottom edge <b>139</b> of the outer layer aperture <b>138</b> relative to the inner layer aperture <b>136</b> in the doubly fastened configuration is depicted by a dotted line. The offset distance O is a minimum of 7 millimeters in order to adequately account for the size of the bump or bulky areas created at the inner layer aperture <b>136</b> and outer layer aperture <b>138</b>. In the arrangement shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>9</b>A and <b>9</b>B</figref>, the entire offset distance O is incorporated into a length L of a body <b>141</b> of the first female part <b>112</b> located between the first opening <b>124</b> and the inner layer aperture <b>136</b>. In the stacked arrangement shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>5</b>-<b>8</b>G</figref>, an offset distance O occurs naturally as a result of the vertical arrangement of the first female part <b>112</b> and the second female part <b>114</b>. Nonetheless, the body <b>141</b> of the first female part <b>112</b> may be elongated to incorporate some or all of the offset distance O.</p>
<p id="p-0054" num="0053">As shown by comparing <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>9</b>A</figref> to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>9</b>B</figref>, the first female part <b>112</b> and the second female part <b>114</b> are identical in a number of ways in order to facilitate their placement adjacent one another in the doubly fastened configuration. The first opening <b>124</b> has a first internal perimeter <b>140</b>, and the second opening <b>126</b> has a second internal perimeter <b>142</b>. The first internal perimeter <b>140</b> and the second internal perimeter <b>142</b> are identical. The first female part <b>112</b> includes a first external perimeter <b>144</b> that includes a first upper portion <b>146</b> partially surrounding the first opening <b>124</b>. The second female part <b>114</b> includes a second external perimeter <b>148</b> that includes a second upper portion <b>150</b> partially surrounding the second opening <b>126</b>. The first upper portion <b>146</b> is identical to the second upper portion <b>150</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0055" num="0054">As also shown by comparing <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>9</b>A</figref> to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>9</b>B</figref>, the first female part <b>112</b> and the second female part <b>114</b> are complementary in a number of ways also to facilitate their placement adjacent one another in the doubly fastened configuration. The first female part includes a first depressed surface <b>152</b> partially surrounding the first opening <b>124</b> and a first raised surface <b>154</b> surrounding the first depressed surface <b>152</b>. The second female part <b>114</b> includes a second depressed surface <b>156</b> partially surrounding the second opening <b>126</b> and a second raised surface <b>158</b> surrounding the second depressed surface <b>156</b>. The first depressed surface <b>152</b> and the first raised surface <b>154</b> are complementary in size and shape to the second depressed surface <b>156</b> and the second raised surface <b>158</b>. In particular, the second depressed surface <b>156</b> and the first depressed surface <b>152</b> may have substantially identical perimeters or one may be slightly larger than the other to facilitate stacking. Likewise, the second raised surface <b>158</b> and the first raised surface <b>154</b> may have substantially identical perimeters or one may be slightly larger than the other to facilitate stacking. The curvature between the first depressed surface <b>152</b> and the first raised surface <b>154</b> may be substantially identical to the curvature between the second depressed surface <b>156</b> and the second raised surface <b>158</b>. The result of these identical and complementary features is that the first female part <b>112</b> and the second female part <b>114</b> can be nestled together in a partially compressed arrangement on the horizontal extension <b>118</b> of the male part <b>110</b> in the doubly fastened configuration.</p>
<p id="p-0056" num="0055">Another feature of the first female part <b>112</b> and the second female part <b>114</b> are the first resilient tab <b>160</b> and the second resilient tab <b>162</b> shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>9</b>A and <b>9</b>B</figref>, as well as in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>8</b>D and <b>8</b>F</figref>. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>9</b>A and <b>9</b>B</figref>, the first resilient tab <b>160</b> includes a first top edge <b>164</b> adjacent the first opening <b>124</b>, and the second resilient tab <b>162</b> includes a second top edge <b>166</b> adjacent the second opening <b>126</b>. When the first female part <b>112</b> and/or the second female part <b>114</b> are hanging on the horizontal extension <b>118</b> of the male part <b>110</b>, the first resilient tab <b>160</b> and the second resilient tab <b>162</b> respectively limit the vertical distance that the first female part <b>112</b> and the second female part <b>114</b> can be displaced. This ensures that the first female part <b>112</b> and the second female part <b>114</b> cannot be displaced a vertical distance greater than the height of the vertical extension <b>120</b>, and thus are not likely to accidentally fall off the horizontal extension <b>118</b> of the male part <b>110</b>. Since the first resilient tab <b>160</b> is only connected to the first female part <b>112</b> at a first bottom edge <b>168</b>, and the second resilient tab <b>162</b> is only connected to the second female part <b>114</b> at a second bottom edge <b>170</b>, the first resilient tab <b>160</b> and the second resilient tab <b>162</b> are able to flex or bend slightly before returning to their original position. This ability to flex or bend facilitates the placement of the first female part <b>112</b> and the second female part <b>114</b> over the vertical extension <b>120</b> and onto the horizontal extension <b>118</b> of the male part <b>110</b>. During placement of the first female part <b>112</b> and the second female part <b>114</b>, the first hole <b>124</b> and the second hole <b>126</b> may not be perfectly aligned with the vertical extension <b>120</b> and/or the horizontal extension <b>118</b>. The first resilient tab <b>160</b> and the second resilient tab <b>162</b> provide some flexibility that enables placement of the first female part <b>112</b> and the second female part <b>114</b> on the male part <b>110</b> despite imperfect alignment. The first resilient tab <b>160</b> and the second resilient tab <b>162</b> are complementary in size and shape to enable a nestled arrangement in the doubly fastened configuration.</p>
