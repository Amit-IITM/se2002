<heading level="1" id="h-0003">FIELD OF THE DISCLOSURE</heading>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">The various embodiments of the present disclosure relate generally to methods, systems, and devices for measuring hemodynamic variables to extract a blood pressure measurement in a subject, and more particularly to extracting blood pressure measurements from pulse transit time (PTT).</p>
<heading level="1" id="h-0004">BACKGROUND</heading>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">Blood pressure abnormalities, such as hypotension and hypertension, are major health care concerns afflicting nearly half of the US population. To exacerbate matters, hypertension is the leading risk factors for cardiovascular diseases and can lead to end organ damage such as heart failure, kidney failure, vascular aneurysm, and retinopathy, among others. To diagnose and manage hypertension, clinicians rely on both clinic and home readings of blood pressure (BP) to property develop management plans. For most people, BP measurements are typically limited to semi-regular clinical visits, but even BP measurements several times a year does not provide insight to dynamic and varying actual blood pressure that can change drastically even within minutes. Therefore, there is a need to provide a more complete picture of heart health and hemodynamics through portable and at-home measurements.</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">The gold-standard for monitoring BP is through an invasive intra-arterial catheter with an attached strain gauge, such as a radial artery pressure measurement commonly used in hospital settings. Other techniques involve an automatic cuff-based oscillometry device that can attach to a limb (e.g., upper arm). This method requires the subject to remain still as the cuff self-inflates and slowly deflates to measure the arterial pulsation through the blood vessels of the limb. While the oscillometry device can be used at home, it is bulky and requires a lengthy procedure where the subject must remain in a static position and can sometimes be painful as the cuff applies pressure above the occlusion level of the blood vessel. A cuff-based wristwatch can reduce the bulkiness of a device, but the measurement of BP in the wrist blood vessels have shown significantly lower accuracies compared to upper-arm BP cuffs (see M. Kikuya, K. Chonan, Y. Imai, E. Goto, M. Ishii, et al., &#x201c;Accuracy and reliability of wrist-cuff devices for self-measurement of blood pressure,&#x201d; <i>Journal of Hypertension</i>, vol. 20, no. 4, pp. 629-638, 2002.). Importantly, devices based on oscillometric cuffs rely solely on the pulse amplitude, tend to be inaccurate in subjects with weak pulses from disorders such as atherosclerosis or obesity, and fail to provide continuous BP measurements.</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">Cuff-less home monitoring solutions for estimating BP could provide continuous, or frequent, measurements of blood pressure and allow for improved detection and management of blood pressure abnormalities. Blood pressure can be estimated based on hemodynamic variables of pulse arrival time (PAT), pre-ejection period (PEP), pulse wave velocity (PWV), and pulse transit time (PTT) using on-body sensors, such as a photoplethysmograph (PPG) in combination with other sensors. Several BP monitoring systems have been proposed based on one or more of these hemodynamic variables; however, these systems require a combination of sensors on a combination of two or more devices, such as oscillometric cuffs, mobile phone sensors, weight scales, beds or platforms with sensors, wearable patches, wearable glasses, finger pulsometers, and/or wearable watches. To enhance the reliability of a subject to consistently measure their BP, there is a need to simplify the device used to estimate the subject&#x2019;s BP. Described herein, the combination of sensors in a single wearable device can reliably detection various hemodynamic variables, including PAT, PEP, and/or PTT to assist in the diagnosis and management of hypertension of a subject.</p>

<p id="p-0145" num="0144">In some embodiments, processor <b>230</b> can be configured to transition to PTT, PAT, or PEP measurement mode when the ECG sensor detects a manual or an automatic trigger. In some embodiments, the subject can touch an electrical sensor positioned on one of the surfaces, such as the wrist-band.</p>
<p id="p-0146" num="0145">In some embodiments, processor <b>230</b> can be configured to initiate two or more sensors while in measurement mode. For example, in PTT measurement mode, processor <b>230</b> can be configured to initiate the sternum PPG sensors and the SCG sensor while wearable device <b>200</b> is placed directly in contact with the subject&#x2019;s skin at the mid sternum. In some embodiments, in PTT measurement mode, processor <b>230</b> may optionally be configured to also initiate wavelengths (i.e., green, red, and IR) of both the wrist PPG sensor.</p>
<p id="p-0147" num="0146">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>11</b></figref>, processor <b>230</b> can be configured to transition between modes in order to estimate a BP measurement. The method <b>1100</b> for transition can include the steps of operating in low power stand-by mode <b>1102</b>, utilizing sensor information and/or activity information in order to determine user intent to take a measurement <b>1104</b>, transitioning to measurement mode <b>1106</b>, taking measurement <b>1108</b>, computing PTT, PEP, PAT, and/or BP <b>1110</b>, and outputting a BP measurement <b>1112</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0148" num="0147">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>12</b></figref>, wearable device <b>200</b> can be configured to transition to measurement mode in order to calibrate measurements for each individual subject. In some embodiments, wearable device <b>200</b> can be calibrated by acquiring pulse transit time (PTT) and blood pressure (BP) cuff measurements hourly over the course of 24 hours, except during sleep. Each measurement can include a sequence of PTT measurements, acquired by contacting wearable device <b>200</b> to the subject&#x2019;s sternum <b>1210</b>, and a sequence of BP cuff measurements, taken using an oscillometric cuff <b>1220</b>. The measurement sequence <b>1230</b> can include a first wearable device measurement <b>1232</b> and a first BP cuff measurement <b>1234</b> followed by a second wearable device measurement <b>1236</b> and a second BP cuff measurement <b>1238</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0149" num="0148">In any embodiment disclosed herein, wearable device <b>200</b> can be configured to provide an alert to the subject that a measurement should be collected in order to generate a calibration. In general, a trend in blood pressure can be estimated from a calibration curve having at least one measurement point when the subject was experiencing high blood pressure and at least one measurement point when the subject was experiencing low blood pressure. In some embodiments, wearable device <b>200</b> can be configured to alert the subject when one or more detected hemodynamic variables indicates an opportune time to transition into measurement mode. For example, when wearable device <b>200</b> detects an increased heart rate while in continuous mode, processor <b>230</b> may be configured to alert the subject (e.g., electrical or vibrational stimulation) to initiate one of the measurement modes to add a measurement point to a calibration curve.</p>
<p id="p-0150" num="0149">In some embodiments, the calibration curve generated by wearable device <b>200</b> from two or more measurement points collected can produce a trend from fewer measurement points than any conventional method. As would be appreciated by those of skill in the art, collecting a blood pressure measurement when a subject&#x2019;s other hemodynamic variables (e.g., heart rate) indicates the subject may be stressed or anxious, could verify the blood pressure calibration curve and assist in monitoring the subject&#x2019;s overall blood pressure health.</p>
<p id="p-0151" num="0150">In some embodiments, the calibration curve generated by wearable device <b>200</b> can be configured to incorporate parameters estimated for a specific subject such that the calibration curve is a hybrid individualized calibration. Example parameters incorporated can include, but are not limited to, cardiovascular risk factors (e.g., diabetes mellitus, hypertension, overweight (BMI &gt; 25 kg/m<sup>2</sup>, family history of heart failure, past chemotherapy, or antihypertensive medication), measurements from oscillometric devices, and the like. A subject can input specific parameters such that the calibration curve generated by wearable device <b>200</b> can factor in additional individualized variables into the blood pressure trend created from receiving blood pressure measurements.</p>
<p id="p-0152" num="0151">In certain embodiments, the calibration curve generated by wearable device <b>200</b> can incorporate parameters that are derived from the general population. For example, the incorporated parameters can include data from epidemiological and/or population statistics such that the subject&#x2019;s blood pressure trend can be a based substantially on a general population trend. In yet another embodiment, the calibration curve can be generated by a combination of blood pressure measurements received by wearable device <b>200</b> and one or more parameters derived from demographic, epidemiological and/or population statistics. For example, the subject&#x2019;s blood pressure trend can be based on the individual blood pressure measurements from wearable device <b>200</b> in combination with a population-based trend.</p>

<heading level="1" id="h-0009">Example 1: Recording Seismocardiogram and Photoplethysmogram Signals in a Wristwatch Form Factor for PTT Measurements</heading>
<p id="p-0154" num="0153">The method uses a wristwatch form factor, similar to that of fitness monitoring wearable devices currently in the market (e.g., Fitbit, Apple Watch, etc.). The methods described herein measure PTT when the user places the face of the watch onto the sternum for a short period of time (&lt; 15 seconds). An accelerometer inside the watch measures the SCG for the proximal timing reference, and PPG sensors facing the wrist measure the distal timing reference. Though the required user input is not conducive for continuous measurements, the device can provide episodic BP estimation as a more convenient alternative to the conventional BP oscillometric cuffs.</p>
<heading level="1" id="h-0010">Example 2: Hardware Design</heading>
<p id="p-0155" num="0154">The system focuses on obtaining SCG and PPG measurements to simultaneously detect both the proximal and distal timing reference, respectively. This system was able to obtain, for the first time, both references from the same convenient wearable device and can be used in an at-home setting by performing a simple maneuver. All parts are commercially available, with similar devices being used in current smart watches.</p>
<p id="p-0156" num="0155">To measure the SCG the ADXL354 accelerometer (Analog Devices, Norwood, MA) was chosen due to its ultra-low noise floor </p>

<p id="p-0161" num="0156">The systems described herein use an array of three IR LED and photodiode pairs. While most wrist-based heart rate monitors (including the Apple Watch) use green LEDs to maximize signal quality for heart rate extraction, IR LEDs allowed for deeper penetration into the skin and for the capture of the arterial pulse wave from the larger arteries. The cathode of the photodiode was biased to 5 V to increase the sensor&#x2019;s linearity and the anodes were connected to a transimpedance amplifier configured to act as a first-order low-pass filter (f<sub>&#x3c7;</sub> = Hz, G = 110 dB) followed by a band-pass filter (BW = 0.7 - 8 Hz, G = 20 dB). A potentiometer in series with the LEDs allowed for manual subject-specific calibration of the LEDs light intensity. After visual inspection of the signal during the study, the light intensity was altered, accounting for differing melanin levels or arterial depths.</p>
<p id="p-0162" num="0157">A custom 3D printed watch was designed to house the accelerometer, photodiodes, and IR LEDs. The watch was tethered to an external box that housed the power supply and AFEs. The backside of the watch that made contact with the wrist included three cutouts approximately 1 cm apart to expose the pairs of photodiodes and LEDs. The spacing allowed for adequate coverage of the wrist and increased the chance of sensing the radial artery.</p>
<heading level="1" id="h-0011">Example 3: Human Subject Studies</heading>
<p id="p-0163" num="0158">To obtain a PTT measurement, the user first rotated the watch to the anterior portion of the wrist, ideally toward the lateral side. This positioned the LEDs above the radial artery. The user then placed the top face of the watch on the body of the sternum, above the xiphoid process. In this position, the accelerometer measured the low-frequency thoracic vibrations represented by the SCG while the PPG measured the pulse wave at the wrist. Consequently, the maneuver increased the contact pressure of the PPGs, improving the coupling between the PPGs and skin and increasing the signal quality.</p>
<p id="p-0164" num="0159">Multiple studies were run to test the robustness and accuracy of the prototype. All studies were approved by IRB, and all subjects provided written informed consent before any studies were begun. In total, thirteen young and healthy subjects were recruited with no history of cardiovascular diseases (age: 23 &#xb1; 3; gender: 8 males, 5 females; weight: 68 &#xb1; 16 kg; height: 173 &#xb1; 10 cm). To acquire a timing reference for the start of a cardiac cycle, the subjects wore standard gel electrodes and a wireless ECG module (BNEL50, Biopack Systems) to measure Lead II ECG. A finger-cuff BP sensor (ccNexfin, Edwards Lifesciences) placed on the hand contralateral to the watch acquired continuous beat-by-beat BP. An MP150 Data Acquisition system (Biopac Systems) sampled all sensors at 2 kHz and stored the data to a desktop computer for post-processing.</p>
<p id="p-0165" num="0160">Three studies were performed to test the device. For all the studies, the subject were asked to remove coats or other bulky clothing. The first study established a proof-of-concept and an ideal-case correlation between PTT and BP with all thirteen subjects participating. This protocol consisted of three sections: one-minute rest, one-minute exercise, and five-minute recovery. During the rest and recovery periods, the subject sat in a chair with the ccNexfin placed on the left index finger and the watch on the right wrist. During the exercise portion, the watch was removed to prevent damages, and the subject performed a stair stepping exercise.</p>
<p id="p-0166" num="0161">Eight of the subjects returned for a follow-up study to test the multi-day repeatability of the PTT and BP correlations. This protocol consisted of two sections: one minute-rest and one-minute cold pressor. Cold pressor replaced exercise as the perturbation to test out the correlation curve under conditions that induced different physiological responses. Traditionally, a cold pressor test involves the subject immersing a hand in a bucket of cold water; however, to allow measurements on both hands and to prevent varying localized BP, each subject placed his / her foot in a bucket of cold water.</p>
<p id="p-0167" num="0162">The final study tested the robustness of the SCG signal on five of the subjects for use in an at-home, unsupervised setting. Contact pressure and sensor location were tested as they are possible sources of user errors that could occur in a home setting. The subjects performed the maneuver and varied the amounts of contact pressures against the sternum, ranging from a light touch to a hard press. Then, the subjects placed the device on varying locations on the chest while maintaining a constant pressure.</p>
<heading level="1" id="h-0012">Example 4: Signal Processing</heading>
<p id="p-0168" num="0163">Post-processing techniques on the accelerometer, PPG, and ECG extracted proximal and distal timing references for PTT. Note that the ECG was selected for its high signal quality and simply used in the studies as fiduciary points to validate the other sensor measurements and would not be required in the actual deployment of the device for home use. Similar techniques to the method used for the sole PPG, could extract the beats without the ECG. One of the technical challenges of the SCG signal is the variability in morphology between subjects and its susceptibility to motion artifacts and respiration-induced waveform distortions. Classical models of the SCG denote the AO as the highest peak immediately following the R-wave of the SCG. However, by this simple method, the MC and AO can sometimes be confused with each other even in healthy subjects.</p>
<p id="p-0169" num="0164"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>8</b></figref> depicts the method of locating the AO as described herein. To determine the correct waveform, both the SCG and the PCG were utilized from the accelerometer signal. A digital filter (BW = 0.8 Hz - 30 Hz) applied to the accelerometer signal extracted the SCG while a higher band filter (BW = 30 Hz - 150 Hz) extracted the PCG. Note that the PCG in this study was identical to the signal obtained using a digital stethoscope, as the accelerometer acted as a contact microphone. Spline interpolation of the local PCG peaks produced an amplitude envelope. Using the timing of the R-wave, the SCG and the enveloped PCG were partitioned into individual beats and ensemble averaged thirty beats together. Since the PCG is commonly used to identify the closing of the mitral valve, the AO was considered to be the first maximum of the SCG that follows the maximum PCG envelope point. The AO point was assumed to be the maximum that directly followed the MC. This technique can only be used during exercise, due to the shortening of PEP cause the MC and AO to occur in rapid succession. However, PEP should only move the timing of AO point and the waveform following the AO point, including the residual peaks, should be retained. To find the AO point in non-exercise signals, all peaks in the exercise signals were mapped out and the SNR of a 50 ms window around each peak was identified. To find the SNR, the pre-ensembled average beats and the same technique as described above were used. The number of peaks between the AO point and the first peak of low SNR were counted. This count to future SCG beats was applied, counting backward from the first peak with low SNR, to determine the AO.</p>
<p id="p-0170" num="0165">To extract the foot of the PPG for the distal timing reference, the highest quality PPG signal was manually determined. A digital band-pass filter (BW = 0.8 Hz - 15 Hz) removed out of band noise. An average of thirty beats removed non-periodic noise. The intersecting tangent method then determined the foot of the PPG. The PTT was then simply the difference between the found AO of the SCG and the foot of the PPG.</p>
<heading level="1" id="h-0013">Example 5: Assessing Correlations Between Wearable PTT and BP</heading>
<p id="p-0171" num="0166"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>17</b>A</figref> illustrates the correlation plot and Bland-Altman plots after a best-case calibration of BP based on PTT for MAP, DP, and SP. The RMSE was simply the root mean square of the difference between the PTT estimated BP and the measured BP. The group RMSE for MAP, DP, and SP was 3.2 mmHg, 2.9 mmHg, and 4.8 mmHg, respectively. DP estimations resulted in the best confidence interval (95%) at 5.8 mmHg. SP estimation proved to the least accurate, with the highest RMSE and a confidence interval at 9.7 mmHg. This result is consistent with physiological expectations since the foot of the PPG waveform represents distal pulse arrival which occurs during diastole rather than systole.</p>
<p id="p-0172" num="0167">Table 1 summaries the individual results of the thirteen subjects when a best-case calibration curve converted PTT to BP. DP formed the lowest error and thus was used for further evaluation. &#xb5;DP was the average diastolic pressure, RMSE was the root mean square error, R was the correlation coefficient, e &lt; 5 mmHg was the ratio between estimations less than 5 mmHg error to the total number of estimations, and e &lt; 10 mmHg was the same ratio but with 10 mmHg of error. Individual RMSE was less than 5 mmHG for twelve of the thirteen subjects. BP estimation errors were below 5 mmHg in eight subjects. Only one subject of the thirteen had a BP estimation error exceeding 10 mmHg.</p>

<p id="p-0174" num="0168"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>13</b>A and <b>13</b>B</figref> depict the follow-up study testing the day-to-day repeatability of the watch with MAP, DP, and SP estimated with PAT and with PTT. The calibration curves of PTT and PAT to BP were calculated using data from the first protocol and applied the respective curves to PTT and PAT values measured during the follow-up study. During rest, PTT-based BP estimations significantly improved both MAP and DP when compared to PAT-based estimations (p &lt; 0.02 and p &lt; 0.005, respectively). During rest, BP estimations improved by an average of 12.3 mmHg when using PTT-based estimations over PAT-based estimations. All eight subjects had MAP and DP estimations within 5 mmHg of their measured BP levels when using PTT. While the best-case BP using PAT produced less than 1.0 mmHg error, three of the eight estimations produced errors of more than 15 mmHg, rendering the measurements not sufficiently accurate for clinical use. DP had a similar comparison. BP estimations improved by an average of 13.9 mmHg with only one subject greater than 5 mmHg error (e = 5.7 mmHg). In contrast, SP estimations were poor. Though PTT calibration produced errors that were, on average, 12.3 mmHg lower than PAT estimation, no significant difference existed between the two estimations (p &gt; 0.05).</p>
<p id="p-0175" num="0169">During the cold pressor test, PTT significantly improved both MAP and DP estimations compared to PAT (p &lt; 0.01 and p &lt; 0.005, respectively). However, PTT-based BP estimations worsened when compared to rest values, averaging 6.3 &#xb1; 4.1 mmHg error for MAP and 5.0 &#xb1; 5.0 mmHg error for DP. Though there was a decline in performance during this perturbation, BP estimation errors were still substantially lower than estimation using PAT which had an average error of 20.1 mmHg for MAP and 18.2 for DP. At the resting phase, the SP estimations were not within an acceptable error. Estimations yielded an average of 13.3 mmHg when using PTT and 27.4 mmHg when using PAT.</p>
<heading level="1" id="h-0015">Example 7: Determining Variability in SCG Signal Quality for Unsupervised Settings</heading>
<p id="p-0176" num="0170">Varying the watch in different locations and contact pressures tested the robustness and reliability of the watch in at-home scenarios when trained personnel are not available to supervise. The three contact pressures resulted in similar SCG signals, and the AO peaks only deviated an average of 3.2 ms, well within the normal variability of PEP. Qualitatively, the signal had similar morphology regardless of contact pressure, exhibiting comparable numbers and relative amplitudes of peaks and troughs. However, varying the locations affected the SCG, changing the morphology of the signal based on the location. When the contact area was at the bottom of the sternum, between the sternal angle and the xiphoid process, the signal was consistent and reliable. Positioning the watch above this section distorted the signal, and the AO peak deviated as much as 85%. Furthermore, locations away from the sternum, such as on the softer tissues of the pectoral muscles, resulted in a misclassification of the AO peak. To obtain a reliable SCG signal, the subject will need to place the watch face on the lower portion of the sternum, which should be feasible even in unsupervised settings. Fortunately, methods exist that use classification algorithms to automatically detect when SCG sensors are in any position other than the desired one. Users can be notified of improper placement and to change position. Finally, the presence of light clothing seemed to have little effect on the quality of the signal as the direct skin contact and contact with a light clothing layer produced similar SCG signals.</p>
<heading level="1" id="h-0016">Example 8: Reliability of the Watch as a BP Monitor</heading>
<p id="p-0177" num="0171">The systems and methods described herein show promise in being able to conveniently obtain BP measurements outside of clinical settings. A strong correlation between BP and PTT obtained from the timing references derived from an SCG and PPG existed for MAP and DP. While SP did not follow as strong of a trend, this is consistent with previous studies.</p>
<p id="p-0178" num="0172">When compared to estimations using PAT, the watch showed a significant increase in accuracy. The addition of the accelerometer to measure SCG as the proximal timing reference for PTT proved to be superior to using the ECG as the proximal reference for PAT during rest. While ECG has the advantage of a higher SNR, the confounding effect of PEP negatively impacted MAP and DP estimation. Physical exercise during the calibration phase had a large effect in shortening the PEP. After exercise, cardiac contractility returned to baseline while BP decreased relative to baseline due to exercise-induced vasodilation. Thus, exercise recovery changed BP and PTT proportionally more than PEP. This corrupted the PAT-based calibration curve and led to an underestimation of BP during the follow-up study when BP and cardiac contractility returned to a baseline. In conditions that greatly vary BP but have little effect on PEP, BP estimation with PAT will be poor, and such conditions are common during normal daily living activities.</p>
<p id="p-0179" num="0173">An increase in error for both PTT and PAT-based estimations were found during the cold pressor when compared to rest, presenting a potential limitation to the current system. The systems described herein measured the pulse wave as it travels through the brachial artery, and the presence of smooth muscle in this arterial path could have accounted for the increase in error between rest and cold pressor. Cold pressor modulated vasomotor tone independent of blood pressure, changing the arterial stiffness and affecting PTT. Though this error occurred, current standards for blood pressure monitoring recommend subjects take measurements at room temperature. Abiding by these recommendations will minimize the impact of the vasomotor tone on PTT.</p>
<p id="p-0180" num="0174">In the systems and methods described herein, the average power consumption was 360 mW. While this would be difficult to sustain for long periods of time using an average smart watch battery, only a few seconds of measurements were sufficient to obtain a PTT. During the follow-up study, only ten beats were processed, resulting in an average recording time of 8.7 seconds. In future iterations, power consumption was minimized by allowing the user to start the measurement. If there is a need for longer measurements, power consumption could be substantially improved by lowering the output intensity of the LEDs with varying current amplitude or duty cycles. Alternatively, the system could decide on the highest quality LED and turn the other two off.</p>
<p id="p-0181" num="0175">Compared to a blood pressure cuff, the systems described herein provide a form factor and measurement procedure that is more convenient. During the study, the subjects were given only basic instructions on how to operate the watch. They were instructed on the proper placement of the device before the protocol started and they were successfully able to repeat the maneuver during the entire protocol. BP cuffs, on the other hand, are susceptible to positioning, cuff size, obesity level, and other user errors that would result in inaccurate readings.</p>
<p id="p-0182" num="0176">Additionally, the subjects could perform the maneuver for five minutes while taking multiple consecutive readings (&gt; 10) without a loss of quality in either the SCG or PPG. The readings were independent of each other, with a measurement having little to no effect on PTT or BP. This would be difficult to achieve with a BP cuff since it is recommended to have one-minute in between successful measurement to prevent the inflation of the cuff, and subsequent occlusions of the artery, from changing the BP at the site of measurement. Thus, dynamic changes in BP in response to stressors such as exercise or mental stress can more readily be quantified with the systems and methods herein.</p>
<p id="p-0183" num="0177">This work explored the feasibility of using a watch-based wearable device to estimate BP based on PTT. A study was conducted to first establish a strong correlation between watch PTT and BP. A follow-up study tested the consistency of the device and compared the watch PTT method to a PAT method that is commonly used. The results show a significant improvement while using the systems disclosed herein compared to the PAT method. This work established a method of extracting BP that is both convenient and robust enough for at-home usage.</p>
<heading level="1" id="h-0017">Example 9: Hardware Design for Home Monitoring</heading>
<p id="p-0184" num="0178">A significant drawback to conventional methods for measuring BP is the lack of portability. To combat this limitation and allow a watch to be used outside the lab, the system and methods of the present disclosure were created. The design was redesigned to incorporate all sensors inside the main body of the watch, removing any need for external components and including an on-board microcontroller, making the watch truly portable. Additionally, to allow for further assessment of cardiac health, an ECG, sternum PPG sensors, gyroscope, and environmental sensor were included. The ECG sensor allows for easy partitioning of the heart beats and can be used to assess the heart rate variability (HRV) to determine autonomic states. To capture sternum PPG, three additional PPG sensors were placed on the top side of the watch to measure the sternum&#x2019;s pulse wave while the user performs the same maneuver needed to capture the SCG. The sternum PPGs will provide an additional timing reference for PTT calculations. A gyroscope was included to sense the gyrocardiogram (GCG) signal. Error can be reduced when using the GCG in combination with SCG to predict the PEP. The environment sensor measures the temperature, relative humidity, and barometric pressure, adding an aspect of activity context for improved physiological interpretations.</p>
<p id="p-0185" num="0179">The complete design features three stacked printed circuit boards and a 150 mAh lithium-ion battery inside of a custom 3D printed case. From the backside of the watch&#x2015; closer to the wrist when worn&#x2014;to the topside, the boards and battery are stacked in the following order (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b>C</figref>): wrist PPG/ECG board, main board, battery, and finally, sternum PPG board. The case includes three slots on both the top and bottom portion to expose the PPG sensors.</p>
<p id="p-0186" num="0180">For the microcontroller, the ATSAM4LS8B (Microchip Technology, Chandler, AZ) was used for its large amount of storage (512 kBytes Flash, 64 kBytes RAM), high number of peripheral options (48 GPIOs, 4 USART), and ultra-low power consumption (1.5 1aA sleep mode). The custom AFEs used in the previous iteration were replaced with selected sensors with internal AFEs to reduce the number of components and power consumption. Additionally, on-board ADCs were not used due to the relatively high noise and low bit conversion compared to external ADCs. Instead, sensors that included an ADC were used. This allowed for a completely digital interface and allowed the sensors to independently make conversions, freeing up processor time on the microcontroller. Sensors that interface via SPI were also used due to the fast clock speeds (12 MHz).</p>

<p id="p-0193" num="0000">The main board also includes the BME280 (Bosch) that features a small package size (2.5 mm x 2.5 mm), low current consumption (3.6 &#xb5;A), and low noise floor of the pressure sensor (0.2 Pa RMS). The microcontroller stores data on an on-board SD card at a write speed of 12 MB/s.</p>
<p id="p-0194" num="0182">The wrist PPG/ECG board, as the name implies, contains both the wrist PPG and ECG circuit. On the back side of the board are three SFH7072s (Osram, Munich, Germany) with each containing a green, red, and infrared LED and two photodiodes. One of the photodiodes blocks red and IR wavelength, improving the detection of a green wavelength, while the second photodiode has a peak sensitivity around the red and IR wavelength. Measurements of PTT would utilize the red and infrared detectors to monitor the deeper arteries. The high-SNR green detector could constantly measure heart rate when the user is not taking a PTT measurement and indicate physiological states between PTT measurement. Each SFH7072 interfaces with a MAX86141 (Maxim Integrated, San Jose, CA) to drive the LEDs and to read the current output of the photodiodes. This board also includes the ECG circuitry, including ADS1291 (Texas Instruments, Dallas, TX), selected due to the low-noise (8 &#xb5;V<sub>pp</sub>) and high-resolution ADC (24-bit). The ADS1291 connects to three dry stainless-steel electrodes. For the negative reference and the right leg drive, two electrodes are placed on the backside of the watch to make contact with the wrist. A third electrode was placed for the positive reference on the outside of the wristband. The user simply touches the electrode with the opposite hand while taking a measurement. Additionally, the ADS 1291 includes a lead-off detection that constantly monitors the connection to the body. This feature allows the user to initiate a measurement by touching the wristband electrode.</p>
<p id="p-0195" num="0183">The remaining board, the sternum PPG board, contains three pairs of SFH7060s (Osram) and MAX86140s (Maxim Integrated). The SFH7060 was selected over the SFH7072 due to the increased area of the photodiodes, increasing the total sensitivity and compensating for the decreased perfusion at the sternum when compared to the wrist. Since the SFH7060 only includes a single photodiode, the one-channel MAX86140 was selected.</p>
<p id="p-0196" num="0184">The ECG is sampled at 1 kHz, the accelerometer and gyroscope are sampled at 500 Hz, the environmental sensor is sampled at 33 Hz, and each PPG sensor is sampled at 333 Hz, and the data is temporarily saved to the SD card. The watch interfaces with the computer through a microUSB port on the main board and is accessible through a cut-out in the case. The HeartPulse App (Department of Anesthesiology, Northwestern Medical, Chicago, IL) communicates with the microcontroller to pull and subsequently delete data on the SD card, freeing up space for future measurements. Additionally, the inserted microUSB interfaces with a battery charger (BQ24232RGTR, Texas Instruments) to charge the battery.</p>
<heading level="1" id="h-0018">Example 10: Device Operations and Measurement Modes</heading>
<p id="p-0197" num="0185">The system of the present disclosure was designed to operate in three modes: standby, continuous, and PTT measurement mode. During standby mode, all sensors on the device are shut down except for a PPG on the wrist, and the watch waits for an interrupt from a PPG which was configured to act as a proximity sensor. When an object approaches the sensor, as when the user places the watch on the wrist (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>6</b>B</figref>) an interrupt flag is set, and the watch transitions to continuous mode. During this mode, the green PPGs, accelerometer, and gyroscope are active and sample at 125 Hz. The environmental sensor is also turned on and samples at 4 Hz. The lower sample rate saves power while providing enough context for activity classification.</p>
<p id="p-0198" num="0186">The watch transitions to PTT measurement mode when the ECG senses a lead-on event. When wearing the watch on the wrist, the user will need to touch the wrist-band electrode with hand contralateral to the watch (as seen in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>6</b>A</figref>). During this mode, all sensors are sampled at the full rate as previously described. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>9</b></figref> shows the ensemble average of the ECG, SCG, GCG, and PPG, during a 30-second recording while the watch was operating in the PTT measurement mode.</p>
<p id="p-0199" num="0187"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>10</b>A and <b>10</b>B</figref> show the recordings of just SCG and sternum PPG signals (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>10</b>A</figref>) and all sensors (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>10</b>B</figref>) during a 10-minute walk outdoors. When the user touched the wrist electrode, the watch successfully transitioned to PTT measurement mode, increasing the sample rate and sampling from all sensors. When the finger was removed, the watch returned to continuous mode, decreasing the sample rate and only sensing from sensors that give activity context for determining physiological states. Configuring the watch to transition between these modes reduces power consumption, reduces memory needs, and indicates timings of PTT measurements.</p>
<p id="p-0200" num="0188">A watch-based system was developed to measure PTT after recording the SCG at the sternum and PPG at the wrist during a simple maneuver. The device was tested over different days and showed an improvement in BP estimation over wrist-based PAT methods. The system was modified to include additional sensors for improved hemodynamic tracking during normal daily living activities. External components were removed such that the device was completely portable with a similar form factor to commercially available smart watches.</p>
<p id="p-0201" num="0189">A primary limitation of the convention devices for measuring BP is the need for a cuff-based BP measurement for calibration during the first use and periodical updates to account for slow changes in arterial stiffness. A solution could leverage posture-induced changes in hydrostatic pressure to calibrate the systems and methods described herein. The subjects would adjust their arms to a specific height above and below the heart, varying the hydrostatic pressure in the arteries. Both BP and PTT would change, and calibration would be possible. This method requires an ECG and SCG to measure PEP which would be assumed to remain constant during the remaining maneuvers. Then, by measuring the PAT at various levels using the ECG and PPG, it is possible to derive changes in BP and PTT for calibration. A BP cuff reading would still be necessary for the initial calibration, but further measurements would not require a BP cuff reading.</p>
<p id="p-0202" num="0190">Another drawback of conventional systems is that the user is constrained to perform the maneuver while static. Although the system and method described herein requires direct contact to the sternum by the device due to the SCG&#x2019;s low signal and poor coupling to the rest of the body, this is substantially improved portability than current cuff-based measurements. Although PTT cannot be constantly monitored, the green wrist PPGs and inertial sensors can continuously record heart rate and activity levels. These sensors would determine the optimal time to take a measurement, such as periods of high heart rate or high activity, and the watch can indicate to the user to take a reading.</p>
<p id="p-0203" num="0191">Using data from multiple days and various perturbations, supervised learning techniques could estimate the AO based on features of the accelerometer and gyroscope. Furthermore, improvements in the portability enable studies in subjects during normal activities of daily living that are necessary to assess the robustness and the ability to measure PTT in an unsupervised setting.</p>

Table 2 details the system specifications including the sample rate for each sensor. The main board contains most of the watch hardware: the microcontroller, charging circuit, accelerometer, gyroscope, environmental sensor, SD card, and various connectors to the other components. For the accelerometer, the ADXL355 (Analog Devices, Norwood, MA) that has a noise floor at 25 &#xb5;g/&#x221a;Hz and resolution of 0.003 mV/bit was selected. This high-resolution, low-noise accelerometer is needed to accurately measure the SCG, which typically has a peak-to-peak amplitude of 8 mg. To measure the GCG, the BMG250 (Bosch, Gerlingen, Germany) was used due to the low output noise (0.007&#xb0;/s/&#x221a;Hz).

<p id="p-0206" num="0193">The wrist PPG/ECG board, as the name implies, contains both the wrist PPG and ECG circuit. On the back side of the board are three SFH7072s (Osram, Munich, Germany) with each containing a green, red, and infrared (IR) light-emitting-diode (LED) and two photodiodes (PDs). One of the PDs blocks red and IR wavelengths, improving the detection of a green wavelength, while the second more broadband PD has a peak sensitivity around the red and IR wavelength. Measurements of PTT would utilize the red and IR detectors to monitor the deeper arteries. The high signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) green detector could constantly measure heart rate when the user is not taking a PTT measurement and indicate physiological states between PTT measurements. Each SFH7072 interfaces with a MAX86141 (Maxim Integrated, San Jose, CA) to drive the LEDs and to read the current output of the PDs. This board also includes the ECG circuitry where the ADS1291 (Texas Instruments, Dallas, TX) was selected due to the low-noise (8 &#xb5;V<sub>pp</sub>) and high-resolution ADC (24 bit). The ADS1291 connects to three dry stainless steel electrodes. For the negative reference and the right leg drive, two electrodes are placed on the backside of the watch to make contact with the wrist. A third electrode was placed on the outside of the wristband for the positive reference. Using the ADS1291&#x2032;s lead-off detection feature, which constantly monitors the connection to the body, the user can initiate a measurement by simply touching the wristband electrode with the opposite hand.</p>
<p id="p-0207" num="0194">The remaining board, the sternum PPG board, contains three pairs of SFH7060s (Osram) and MAX86140s (Maxim Integrated, San Jose, CA). The SFH7060 was selected over the SFH7072 due to the increased area of the PDs, increasing the total sensitivity and compensating for the decreased perfusion at the sternum when compared to the wrist. Since the SFH7060 only includes a single PD, the single-channel MAX86140 AFE was selected. Similar to the SFH7072, the SFH7060s still contain green, red, and IR LEDs.</p>
<p id="p-0208" num="0195">The data is temporarily saved to the SD card. The watch interfaces with the computer through a microUSB port on the main board and is accessible through a cut-out in the case. A custom C# based app communicates using the USB protocol with the microcontroller to pull and subsequently delete data on the SD card, freeing up space for future measurements. Additionally, the inserted microUSB interfaces with a battery charger (bq24232, Texas Instruments) to charge the battery.</p>
<heading level="1" id="h-0020">Example 12: Device Operations</heading>
<p id="p-0209" num="0196">The systems and methods described herein was designed to operate in three modes: standby, continuous, and PTT measurement mode. During standby mode, all sensors on the device are shutdown except for a single green PPG on the wrist which is sampled at 8 Hz and configured to act as a proximity sensor. When an object approaches the sensor, as when the user places the watch on the wrist, an interrupt flag is set, and the watch transitions to continuous mode. During this mode, the three green wrist PPGs, accelerometer, and gyroscope are active and sample at 125 Hz. The environmental sensor is also turned on and samples at 4 Hz. The lower sample rate saves power while providing enough context for activity classification. The watch transitions to PTT measurement mode when the ECG senses a lead-on event. To trigger this mode when wearing the watch on the wrist, the user will need to touch the wrist-band electrode with the hand contralateral to the watch (as seen in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>12</b></figref>). During PTT measurement mode, the sternum PPGs are turned on and the device was placed directly in contact with the subject&#x2019;s skin at the mid sternum. All wavelengths (i.e., green, red, and IR) of both the wrist and sternum PPGs were activated. The sternum was chosen primarily for optimal SCG quality based on some of previous work characterizing signal quality at different sensor placement locations. In this mode, all sensors are sampled at the full rate as shown in Table 2 above. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>9</b></figref> shows the ensemble average of the ECG, SCG, GCG, and PPG during a 30-second recording while the watch was operating in the PTT measurement mode.</p>
<p id="p-0210" num="0197"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>10</b>B</figref> shows the recordings of all sensors during a 10-minute walk outdoors. When the user touched the wrist electrode, the watch transitioned to PTT measurement mode, increasing the sample rate and sampling from all sensors. When the finger was removed, the watch returned to continuous mode, decreasing the sample rate and only sensing from sensors that give activity context for determining physiological states. Configuring the watch to transition between these modes reduces power consumption and memory requirements, as well as indicating PTT measurement timings.</p>
<p id="p-0211" num="0198">To compensate for variable PPG signal quality due to different skin tones amongst subjects, the LED drive current was automatically adjusted for the individual PPGs and wavelengths to prevent railing and improve signal quality. This required having a two-state current threshold and adaptively decreasing the LED current and switching to the lower threshold value if the most significant byte (MSB) of the input light measured from the PD exceeded the higher threshold. Otherwise, the current cutoff was increased to its higher value to allow the signal to grow in amplitude.</p>
<heading level="1" id="h-0021">Example 13: Study Protocol</heading>
<p id="p-0212" num="0199">This study was conducted under a protocol approved by the Institutional Review Board (IRB). For this study, 21 (16 males, 5 females) young and healthy volunteers (Age: 25.9&#xb1;3.4 years, Weight: 74.4&#xb1;16.9 kg, Height: 176.3&#xb1;10.9 cm, and BMI: 23.7&#xb1;3.6) with no prior history of heart problems were recruited, and written informed consent was obtained. The subjects were instructed to take the watch and an Association for the Advancement of Medical Instrumentation (AAMI) approved BP785N BP cuff (Omron, Kyoto, Japan) home and acquire measurements hourly over the course of 24 hours, taking at least 12 total measurements. In addition, they were told to specifically take a measurement directly before and after bedtime and to not wear the watch during sleep. Therefore, the watch was worn until bedtime to obtain data from the continuous mode-for activity context was charging during sleep and re-worn the next morning. The subjects were briefed on how to use the watch and BP cuff to perform measurements. Since all the data was saved automatically from both devices the protocol required low-user-input, essential for an at-home measurement system. Every measurement session consisted of five sections broken down into three 30 second watch measurements with BP cuff measurements in between as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>12</b></figref>, resulting in approximately three-minute-long measurement sessions. At least 15 seconds were added between the middle watch measurement and the BP cuff measurements before and after to comply with the American Heart Association&#x2019;s (AHA&#x2019;s) recommendation of one-minute intervals between BP cuff measurements.</p>
<heading level="1" id="h-0022">Example 14: Signal Processing</heading>
<p id="p-0213" num="0200">Only the data from the PTT measurement mode were analyzed in this work. The entire recording was partitioned using the serviceable ECG lead-on detection feature to extract signals from each of the individual measurement sessions. The length of signals was reduced to 15 seconds per session for PTT analysis to remove sections corrupted with motion artifacts caused by the subject still adjusting and placing the watch on the sternum. Additionally, the sternum and all green and red wavelength PPGs were not utilized as the IR wavelength wrist PPGs had the highest mean SNR, potentially due to IR wavelength&#x2019;s ability to penetrate deeper in the tissue and capture larger, more pulsatile arteries. Furthermore, only data from the last cuff reading and measurement session were used because the subject had a greater likelihood of reaching a resting steady-state before readings. Since the subjects did not take both measurements at the same time, using the later measurements when the subject was more likely to have a constant BP allowed us to more accurately compare cuff BP to watch PTT. However, a few subjects had corrupted watch measurements due to erratic toggling probably due to misapplication of the ECG. In those cases, the latest clean watch section was used. For those first-watch section subjects, the first BP cuff measurement was also used. For the other subjects, the first cuff measurement was used because the second had the lowest recorded standard deviation (SD) of DP at 2.2 mmHg.</p>
<p id="p-0214" num="0201">The PTT was calculated as the difference between the proximal timing reference, aortic valve opening (AO) point of the dorso-ventral SCG (i.e., z-axis acceleration), and the distal timing reference, foot of highest SNR PPG. First, the ECG, SCG, and PPG signals were filtered using a digital FIR bandpass filter with a bandwidths of 2.2 - 30 Hz, 0.8 - 25 Hz, 1 - 8 Hz, respectively. Then, the SCG and PPG waveforms were split into separate beats by using a simple peak detection algorithm for determining R-to-R intervals of the ECG. Next, the SCG and PPG beats were ensemble averaged and the resulting waveforms were used to extract both of the aforementioned timing references. The SNR was calculated using a noise-to-signal ratio (NSR) detection algorithm, the foot of the PPG was computed from the tangental point method, and the AO point was assumed to be the first peak in each ensemble averaged window. SNR thresholds were set to retain only high fidelity signals; if the SNR of the SCG or PPG beats was not greater than the prescribed cutoff, then the respective ensemble averaged waveforms were deemed too noisy for use. If the SCG or all of the PPG waveforms were discarded, then that measurement session was not used for PTT calculation. If the subject had fewer than 9 measurements with valid SNR levels, the SNR thresholds were gradually decreased in an effort to yield more data points. This approach led to subject-specific SNR thresholds but only yielded at least 75% of total measurement sessions per subject for regression.</p>
<heading level="1" id="h-0023">Example 15: Statistical Analysis</heading>
<p id="p-0215" num="0202">Multiple linear regression tests were performed to calculate the coefficient estimates necessary to estimate MAP, DP, and SP from inverse PTT values for each subject. Outliers were removed if the corresponding residual was greater than expected in 95% of new observations. The root-mean-square-error (RMSE) was calculated from the root-mean-square (RMS) of the difference between the estimated BP and measured BP. The error bounds for analysis were chosen based on the AAMI&#x2019;s guidelines for noninvasive cuff-less BP devices.</p>
<heading level="1" id="h-0024">Example 16: Calibration Analysis</heading>
<p id="p-0216" num="0203">For the calibration tests only DP values were examined as research has shown that only DP correlates accurately with PTT [5]. Data points of PTT and corresponding DP values for each subject were randomly selected for training an intra-subject linear regression curve used to determine calibration coefficients. These coefficients were then used to estimate DP based on the PTT values from the remaining data points (i.e., testing set) for that subject. As aforementioned, the RMSE was computed between the estimated and measured DP. This process was repeated until the averaged RMSE reached an expected value. An increasing number of training points were used, which were again independently and randomly selected from each subject. Data are shown until a total of six training points as there were subjects with only seven total data points. Since regression was not possible based on a single training point, the first randomly selected data point&#x2019;s DP value would be the same estimated DP value for all of the subject&#x2019;s points was assumed for single-point calibration, hence the labeling &#x2018;Constant BP.&#x2019;</p>
<p id="p-0217" num="0204">To test the performance of a semi-globalized model to estimate DP from PTT, global constraints were placed on either the slope or y-intercept calibration coefficient while adaptively changing the other. The individual global methods either fix the testing subject&#x2019;s y-intercept or slope to the y-intercept or slope output of the linear regression curve calculated from all the PTT and DP data points for all the remaining subjects, respectively. The other calibration coefficient was estimated for each subj ect independently using this global constraint for an increasing number of calibration points.</p>
<p id="p-0218" num="0205">Two two-point calibration methods were tested and compared to the regular multi-point calibration already presented in this work. For these methods either both the PTT values associated with the maximum and minimum BP or the maximum and minimum PTT values over the subject&#x2019;s 24-hour period were chosen for use in training a linear regression curve for BP estimation. Subjects were removed if BP and PTT values used for calibration directly correlated. This resulted in only one subject being removed, and only for the BP dynamic range method. The other subject that was removed from both methods was identified as an outlier probably due to having the lowest Pearson correlation coefficient (r = 0.44) of the entire population. Two-sample t-tests were performed for these various calibration analyses to assess the significance (p&lt;0.05) level of these differences in RMSE from independent, randomly sampled points with normal distributions.</p>
<heading level="1" id="h-0025">Example 17: 24-Hour At-Home Device Results</heading>
<p id="p-0219" num="0206"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref> illustrates the correlation and Bland-Altman plots for PTT-based BP calibration of MAP, DP, and SP across all subjects. A more thorough view of the results per subject are provided in Table 3, below. The mean&#xb1;SD RMSE was 2.72&#xb1;0.75 mmHg, 2.99&#xb1;1.12 mmHg, and 4.75&#xb1;2.29 mmHg for DP, MAP, and SP, respectively. DP and MAP estimation had better confidence intervals (95%) than SP at 5.64 mmHg, 6.48 mmHg, and 10.67 mmHg, respectively. The Pearson correlation coefficients were 0.69, 0.61, and 0.33 for PTT-based DP, MAP, and SP estimation respectively. Across all subjects, data from 216 out of 245 total measurement sessions (88%) was used, with at least 75% of measurements used per subject. All unused measurement sessions were deemed too noisy for a trustworthy PTT calculation.</p>

<p id="p-0221" num="0207"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>14</b></figref> depicts changes in RMSE across a different number of training points and comparisons between semi-globalized calibration models. Notably, in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>15</b></figref> RMSE significantly (p&lt;0.05) decreased from a single-point calibration (6.05&#xb1;1.75 mmHg) to four-point (4.73&#xb1;2.41 mmHg, p = 0.0495), five-point (4.24&#xb1;1.97 mmHg, p = 0.0043), and six-point (3.83&#xb1;1.40 mmHg, p = 0.0004) calibration. Four points were the minimum required for calibration to result in a mean (4.73&#xb1;2.41 mmHg) that was lower than that of the single-point calibration (6.05&#xb1;1.75 mmHg). Despite not showing statistical significance, the globalized slope calibration model in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>15</b></figref> outperformed the regular intrasubject calibration with one point (5.34&#xb1;1.59 mmHg vs. 6.05&#xb1;1.75 mmHg). However, at four and six points the regular intrasubject calibration model began to outperform the global y-intercept model (4.73&#xb1;2.41 mmHg vs. 4.81&#xb1;1.22 mmHg) and global-slope model (3.83&#xb1;1.40 mmHg vs. 4.03&#xb1;1.28 mmHg) respectively.</p>
<p id="p-0222" num="0208"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>16</b></figref> shows the box-plots of two different two point calibration methods compared to the regular multi-point calibration method. The mean&#xb1;SD values for the regular multi-point, BP dynamic range, and PTT dynamic range methods are 2.71&#xb1;0.75 mmHg, 5.99&#xb1;3.03 mmHg, and 3.86&#xb1;1.53 mmHg respectively. Both dynamic range two-point calibration methods significantly outperformed the regular, randomly selected, two-point intrasubject testing loss (11.62&#xb1;16.82 mmHg) seen in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>14</b></figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0223" num="0209">The effectiveness of PTT-based BP in an uncontrolled setting, where external stimuli can modulate vasomotor tone independently from BP and generate unbalanced peripheral arterial elasticity which relates to PTT. Over the course of a day, several encounters and stressors can instantaneously modulate sympathetic arousal to different degrees acutely affecting vascular smooth muscle tone prior to and independently from BP, transiently confounding PTT but not BP cuff measurements. Additionally, during common daily activities such as consuming caffeine, arterial stiffness increases acutely and independently from changes in BP. Even with these diverse factors&#x2014;intrinsically coupled to an around-the-clock study-affecting vascular tone independently from BP and confounding PTT measurements, the systems and methods described herein were able to get a reliable correlation between PTT and BP. DP estimation proved to be the most accurate. The foot of the PPG waveform signifies the arrival of the distal pulse wave and signifies end-diastole. Meanwhile, measurements based on SP estimation performed the worst, as the peak rather than the foot of the pulse wave was more related to systole. However, a few studies have shown that detecting systolic peaks is more error prone due to false identification of the reflected pulse wave. It is noteworthy that the subject with the highest Pearson correlation coefficient (subject = 21, r = 0.95) also had the greatest standard deviation of DP (&#xb1; 12). Therefore, the systems and methods herein prove to be a promising possible indication that it would be best to acquire fewer, more significant, calibration points after some initial exercise or when BP has changed past a significant threshold from baseline to capture the full dynamic range of normal daily BP.</p>
<heading level="1" id="h-0026">Example 18: Two-Point Calibration Method</heading>
<p id="p-0224" num="0210">Two-point calibration methods and semi-globalized adaptive calibration models for measuring BP are based on PTT measurements described herein.</p>
<p id="p-0225" num="0211">This data suggests that even with only four points- on average less than half of the used data points for the multi-point calibration-this device could predict BP over the course of a day within the AAMI&#x2019;s standards. Due to outliers stemming from the inclusion of noise and lack of BP range, the regression-based approach for two and three-point calibration performed worse than single-point calibration. Furthermore, given the method for single-point calibration, this graph depicts both the need for computing a Pearson correlation coefficient-a metric that no previous PTT-based study measuring natural variability in BP has provided-and the difficulties associated with obtaining a higher correlation with such a small dynamic range in measurements.</p>
<p id="p-0226" num="0212">To reduce the need for calibration points, global model parameters were incorporated into subject-specific models. These integrated models were better estimators of BP than the regular intrasubject multi-point method with a fewer number of calibration points. Understandably, the multi-point subject-specific calibration method eventually surpassed the global models. Additionally, the global slope model outperformed the global y-intercept model considerably and consistently, as well as the regular intrasubject testing loss until six points, though not significantly other than at three calibration points. Compared to a globalized model, a subject-specific model will realistically always have improved performance, with the downside of increased complexity. However, in the meantime this result shows potential in the feasibility of reducing this complexity through fewer calibration requirements. A heuristic approach that represents an intermediate-globalized model can be adaptively and marginally tailored to a specific subject to provide a more accurate estimation when using fewer calibration points for estimation. In addition, the two-point calibration methods greatly improve upon the intrasubject two-point calibration testing loss seen in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>14</b> and <b>15</b></figref>. This can be attributed to a training set with increased BP range, thereby avoiding randomly selected points that neighbor one another and thus do not offer a good assessment of normal daily BP range. Markedly, the PTT dynamic range method shows statistically significant improvement when compared to the BP dynamic range method, potentially due to accounting for differences in vasomotor tone confounding PTT-based BP estimation. These results become especially important when considering the ability of the hardware to use a multi-modal sensor fusion approach to gate different operational modes and prompt users for more physiologically salient calibration measurements. That is, the fewer the calibration points required, the greater the time the device can spend operating in low-power states providing a more optimal device for the monitoring of hypertension throughout the day remotely. In order to decrease computation even more, this data suggests that a recursive least-squares approach could be applied to a subject&#x2019;s past data to optimally estimate a calibration curve given a new point. Finally, once enough datasets amongst at-home, longitudinal, and at-risk monitoring subjects have been collected, these similar methods could be reanalyzed and combined with more recent work that has shown promise in estimating blood pressure either through analytical models or machine learning approaches for a potential globalized model.</p>
<p id="p-0227" num="0213">Compared to an oscillometric cuff, this unobtrusive, watch-based wearable device was conducive to true at-home BP monitoring in an uncontrolled setting and offered a more convenient way to take PTT measurements. The increased convenience is intrinsic to the portable design that does not employ oscillometry which occludes the vessel, causing not only increased measurement error in back-to-back readings, but also discomfort. As a result, the device may increase user compliance, addressing the need for a more widespread adoption of remote BP monitoring. Additionally, the maneuver where the user places the watch on their sternum benefits from being at a heart level which helps increase BP reading accuracy from wrist-worn devices. Though there is a need for continuous BP monitoring in a reliable device that is usable enough to feasibly acquire multiple around-the-clock BP measurements, more conveniently than a BP cuff, providing a clinician a sufficient assessment of normal daily BP variability.</p>
<p id="p-0228" num="0214">The need for different SNR cutoffs when analyzing data stemmed from low SNR signals which could be attributed to different skin tones&#x2014;despite auto-optimization of drive currents-placement errors, and an overall higher intersubject and intrasubject variability in an at-home, around-the-clock, unsupervised study. Despite these factors, the device disclosed herein allowed for reliable measurements as all of the measurements were well within the ranges set by the AAMI (&#xb5; &#x2264; 5 mmHg and &#x3c3; &#x2264; 8 mmHg). The significance of this work lies in its unobtrusive, reliable, and wearable noninvasive BP estimation. These three integral features of the device demonstrate its promise in addressing the need for an around-the-clock, at-home device capable of consistent normal daily BP monitoring&#x2014;a major contribution towards diagnosing and managing hypertension remotely.</p>
<p id="p-0229" num="0215">There does not exist a device currently in research or on the market that combines a multi-wavelength, multi-location PPG array, high-resolution ECG, and ultra-sensitive accelerometer and gyroscope into a compact device that can be used for BP estimation. Furthermore, only because of this unique combination of sensing modalities, a novel firmware was developed that uses multiple sensors to switch between different operational modes that extend battery life&#x2014;an emerging requirement for wearable devices. The device has a power consumption low enough to easily acquire PTT data for a complete assessment of around-the-clock BP changes. This was enabled through the additional capability of transitioning between device modes (PTT measurement, continuous, standby mode) that allowed the device save battery life (8, 30, and 38 hrs) and reduce memory requirements. If used as an ambulatory BP cuff, which takes measurements every 30 minutes, the watch would only be in measurement mode 0.8% of the time with 15 second measurements. Thus, battery life is minimally affected by power used during PTT measurement mode and could be greatly improved by simply decreasing power consumption during continuous and standby mode through the use of sleep states already built-into the hardware.</p>
<p id="p-0230" num="0216">One of the challenges of using the SCG as the proximal timing reference is determining the true AO peak. The signal varies greatly between subjects, and the peaks can either be mistaken for the wrong physiological markers or the location of the peaks can be corrupted by either motion artifacts or improper placement of the watch. The method to determine the AO point led to a high correlation between PTT and BP, for a few sessions it annotated the incorrect AO point and had to be manually remedied. At-home monitoring of natural variability in BP is a more challenging problem and dictates a need to capitalize on promising signal processing advances. Specifically, by using new machine learning (ML) approaches to assess signal quality or a gyroscope as an additional proximal timing reference.</p>
<p id="p-0231" num="0217">To improve the distal timing reference, an array of three PPGs was attached to the top side of the watch. These PPGs now allow for a pulse wave measurement at the sternum as the user performs the same maneuver needed to capture the SCG. The sternum PPGs might be more closely related to central aortic pressure, a more significant indicator of hypertension and cardiovascular mortality, and therefore might be less afflicted by smooth muscle contraction. However, first, an in-depth characterization of locations for high sternum PPG signal quality must be completed and cross-examined with SCG quality to determine an overall optimized sensor placement location that mitigates potential differences in locations that present with high PPG, SCG SNR. Additionally, there are PPG signal features which will not only allow better selection amongst the various PPGs but also elucidate properties of the underlying waveform morphology that are of greater importance in older, hypertensive populations. For example, features such as the augmentation index and rise-time have been shown to capture physiologically salient pulse waves that generate a more accurate, and meaningful estimated BP.</p>
<p id="p-0232" num="0218">The quantity of calibration points required can be decreased by selecting ones with more quality and physiological significance. During continuous mode the watch samples the accelerometer, gyroscope, environmental sensor, and green wavelength wrist PPGs which can yield clear hemodynamic activity contextualized information. This feature was included to determine a key time of greater likelihood of BP variability (e.g, via heart rate variability) to prompt for a BP calibration measurement. SCG algorithms utilizing ML approaches should be leveraged to assess positioning and placement inaccuracies to forgo poor measurements or immediately tell the user to readjust for optimal SCG quality and resulting PTT calculation. All of this could not be achieved through the use of a single sensor alone. It is contemplated that reliable subject-specific calibration curves can function across several days, thereby eliminating the need for consistent re-calibration. Nevertheless, pulse wave velocity has been shown to be an independent predictor of longitudinal increases in SP lending credibility to the possibility of attaining a calibration-less option. Specifically, the changes in vasomotor tone, captured by PTT, might also imply that perhaps changes in these calibration factors between successive calibration points can be used to determine changes in arterial elasticity. Insight into longitudinal, consistent, remote monitoring using a PTT-based method might indicate that PTT can notice subclinical changes in arterial elasticity and structure prior to exacerbations such as hypertension and renal failure.</p>
<p id="p-0233" num="0219">The device can store its data to an SD card. It is contemplated that for remote monitoring, wireless technologies (e.g., cellular, LoRa, Blue-tooth, and Wi-Fi) can be incorporated such that data can be automatically uploaded to the cloud for clinicians to view. A crucial benefit that remote BP monitoring offers is being able to assess treatment efficacy of BP medications for patients at-home, which is significantly more difficult and stressful if patients have to visit a doctor regularly, ironically exacerbating their health status. Therefore, PTT-based BP estimation could be handled on-chip or on the cloud prior to viewing by leveraging advances in lightweight firmware or cloud-based algorithms for computation.</p>
