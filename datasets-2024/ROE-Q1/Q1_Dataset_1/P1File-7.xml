<heading level="1" id="h-0001">BACKGROUND</heading>
<p id="p-0002" num="0001">Nutritionists, commonly cite poor diet, including the consumption of processed oils, such as those used in fried foods, as a significant contributing factor to heart disease and obesity, among other health concerns. Oilseed for foodstuffs commonly include soybean oil, canola oil, corn oil, and peanut oil. More detail is given in the present application to soybean processing because of its greater relative importance to the vegetable oil industry, though embodiments may apply to all types of oilseed and oil processing in general.</p>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">Soybean oil production, in particular, typically includes elevator operations that comprise receiving, storing, and cleaning raw soybeans. The soybeans are typically prepared for solvent solution and oil desolventizing. Oil refining is performed, and the spent flakes are desolventized and otherwise processed.</p>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">More specifically, the extraction process includes extracting oil for soybeans the oil from soybean, and ultimately, with pure hexane. The oil and hexane may be partially removed from an extractor separately from the defatted flakes. In some instances, a desoventizer-toaster is used to evaporate some of the hexane from the flakes. In applications for human food, rather than animal feeds, the flakes may be treated with a superheated hexane solvent.</p>
<heading level="1" id="h-0002">SUMMARY</heading>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">According to a particular embodiment, a method of oilseed processing may include applying a solution solvent comprising ethyl alcohol that produces an oilseed mixture comprising meal and oil. The method further may include separating the meal from the oil. The resultant meal of this process may constitute broader applications in the animal feed and meal markets than these using hexane as the solution solvent.</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">According to another particular embodiment, a method of oilseed processing may include applying a solvent solution over oilseed, where the solvent solution includes at least one of a nonpolar solvent and ethyl alcohol. The application of the solvent solution may produce an oilseed mixture comprising meal and oil. The method may further include separating the solvent solution from the oil, and refining the oil. Such a method of oilseed processing and refining of the oil yields a product with substantially greater stability</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">According to another particular embodiment, a method of oilseed processing includes presenting a plurality of flakes that include oilseed, and applying a solvent solution over the plurality of flakes, where the solvent solution includes at least one of a nonpolar solvent and ethyl alcohol. The application of the solvent solution produces an oilseed mixture comprising meal and oil. The method further may include separating the meal from the oil.</p>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">According to another particular embodiment, a method of oilseed processing may include applying a solvent solution over the plurality of flakes, where the solvent solution includes at least one of a nonpolar solvent and ethyl alcohol.

<heading level="1" id="h-0004">DETAILED DESCRIPTION</heading>
<p id="p-0014" num="0013">A method of oilseed processing may use an extraction solvent comprising ethyl alcohol that is applied in the process of oil extraction. Solvents of similar effect to that of ethyl alcohol may be used in conjunction to produce the desired result. Such a production method yields oil with substantially greater oil stability. Oil may be extracted from oilseed by using ethyl alcohol as the solvent, and the extracted oil is thus desolvetized in a manner that results in diminished amounts of or an absence of a residual solvent.</p>
<p id="p-0015" num="0014">As a result of oil extraction and processing, the subsequent meal is of increased palatability for animal and human consumption. Through such extraction and processing methods oil and meal are free of residue and undesirable characteristics commonly associated with other traditional methods of oil extraction (e.g., that involve hexane-based extraction solvents.</p>
<p id="p-0016" num="0015">An embodiment of the system and associated method may include introducing a nonpolar solvent or ethyl alcohol as an extraction solvent in oilseed processing and extraction techniques. A particular embodiment may replace hexane with ethyl alcohol as a solvent for soybean oil extraction.</p>
<p id="p-0017" num="0016">According to an illustrative embodiment, an extraction solvent blend may include a solvent alcohol that has been denatured with a nonpolar solvent, such as diethyl ether. The denatured product may be introduced in an extraction process as the extraction solvent. In another example, a process includes a nonpolar solvent, such as ethyl alcohol, as the extraction solvent in the extraction process.</p>
<p id="p-0018" num="0017">Embodiments may use existing soybean processing machinery, thus avoiding costs associated with reconfigurations and significant equipment acquisitions. While embodiments described herein are in the context of soybean processing, the principles described herein may apply to other types of oilseed. Certain embodiments may be used in any refining or processing application, even unrelated to oilseed. Processing operations for soybean oil, canola oil, canola oil, corn oil, and peanut oil are very common. More detail is given to soybean processing because of its greater relative importance to the vegetable oil industry.</p>
<p id="p-0019" num="0018">Although pure ethyl alcohol or nonpolar solutions may be used as a solvent, other embodiments explained herein may include ethyl alcohol or nonpolar solutions that are combined with other solvents to achieve a desired effect.</p>
<p id="p-0020" num="0019">In an example of soybean meal hexane residue extraction, a process includes introducing a nonpolar solvent, such as ethyl alcohol, as the extraction solvent in the extraction process. Alcohol may be introduced to soybean meal containing residual hexane. Soybean meal may be saturated in equally proportionate levels of alcohol to meal. Once the meal has fully absorbed the alcohol, the meal may then be dried revealing the absence of both the solvent alcohol and hexane.</p>
<p id="p-0021" num="0020">According to another particular embodiment, a process includes introducing a solvent alcohol to soybean meal containing hexane to remove hexane from the meal after oil extraction.</p>
<p id="p-0022" num="0021">Some applications of the processes and products associated with embodiments disclosed herein may relate to medical treatment plans, to include diet.</p>
<p id="p-0023" num="0022">Within this context, the replacement of hexane by ethanol (either hydrous or anhydrous) as solvent for soybean oil extraction may be realized. An embodiment of a method may include introducing a nonpolar solvent or ethyl alcohol as an extraction solvent in oilseed processing and extraction techniques.</p>
<p id="p-0024" num="0023">An example of an extraction solvent blend may include a process in which solvent alcohol is denatured with a nonpolar solvent as the extraction solvent. In another example, a process in which hexane is denatured with a nonpolar solvent, such as alcohol, which is introduced in the extraction process as the extraction solvent. In still another example, a process includes introducing a nonpolar solvent, such as ethyl alcohol, as the extraction solvent in the extraction process.</p>
<p id="p-0025" num="0024">While an extraction solvent consisting of ethyl alcohol or a nonpolar solvent may be advantageous (e.g., containing no hexane), other embodiments may include a solvent comprising either or both ethyl alcohol and a nonpolar solvent, as well as hexane or other compounds. While such embodiments of solvents are contemplated, a hexane-free product is possible using either ethyl alcohol and a nonpolar solvent in the absence of hexane.</p>
<p id="p-0026" num="0025"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref> is an embodiment of a system <b>100</b> that may introduce a nonpolar solvent or ethyl alcohol as an extraction solvent in oilseed processing and extraction techniques. A specific example of an extraction solvent blend may include a process in which solvent alcohol is denatured with a nonpolar solvent, such as diethyl ether, and introduced in the extraction process as the extraction solvent. In another example, a nonpolar solvent, such as ethyl alcohol, may comprise the extraction solvent in the extraction process. In some instances, the system <b>100</b> may use existing soybean processing machinery, thus avoiding costs associated with reconfigurations and significant equipment acquisitions. While the system <b>100</b> is configured for soybean processing, or systems are contemplated for other types of oilseed. Additionally, one or more machines of other embodiments may be added or removed from a system in relation to the illustrative system <b>100</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0027" num="0026">Turning more particularly to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>, a grading machine <b>102</b> may grade soybeans based on weight, moisture, protein content, and oil content, among other factors. In one example, the grading machine <b>102</b> uses infrared spectroscopy for the sorting.</p>
<p id="p-0028" num="0027">Screeners of a cleaning machine <b>104</b> may receive soybeans to remove foreign materials and weed seeds. The soybeans may be stored or flash dried with heat at a drying machine <b>106</b> to dry the soybeans down to an acceptable moisture level.</p>
<p id="p-0029" num="0028">Large rollers of a cracking machine <b>108</b> may crack the soybeans into small pieces. An aspirator machine <b>110</b> may use air flow to separate hulls from kernels. Other rollers at a flaking machine <b>112</b> m ay flatten the kernels into flakes to increase surface area and disrupt oil cell structure.</p>
<p id="p-0030" num="0029">At an extracting machine <b>114</b>, an embodiment of the system <b>100</b> may introduce a solvent that includes a: least one of ethyl alcohol and a nonpolar solvent. The solvent may be run over the flakes to extract oil.</p>
<p id="p-0031" num="0030">According tc a particular embodiment, the solvent (i.e., ethyl alcohol or the nonpolar solvent) may be mixed in equal parts with the soybean mixture. In another example, the amounts of solvent and soybean mixture may be mixed in different ratios. For instance, the amount (e.g., by volurr e or weight) of the solvent may be up to 25% more or less than the amount of soy bean mixture.</p>
<p id="p-0032" num="0031">According to the same or another embodiment, the solvent may comprise ethyl alcohol or the nonpolar solvent, in addition to another solvent. In an embodiment where hexane is additionally used, the ethyl alcohol or nonpolar solvent may function to reduce or eliminate the residual hexane.</p>
<p id="p-0033" num="0032">In the embodiment of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>, the system <b>100</b> splits the meal from the oil down different paths after the extracting machine <b>114</b>. Along the oil path of the system <b>100</b>, the oil may be stripped from the extractor at a stripping machine <b>116</b>. The oil may take the form of micella, a combinatior of oil and solvent.</p>
<p id="p-0034" num="0033">A distilling machine <b>118</b> may separate the solvent from the oil. The oil may comprise crude soybean oil at this stage.</p>
<p id="p-0035" num="0034">Lecithins and other gums may be removed from the oil at <b>120</b>. The oil may be classified as degummed soybean oil at this stage.</p>
<p id="p-0036" num="0035">Along the meal, or flake, path <b>117</b> of the system <b>100</b>, a desolventizer-toaster-dryer-cooler (DTDC)<b>122</b> may be provided. Toasting may remove unwanted material, and drying may optimize moisture. Cooling processes may get the meal flakes close to ambient temperature.</p>
<p id="p-0037" num="0036">The meal may be sized using a series of screens at a sizing machine <b>124</b>, and the final meal product may be tested at an evaluation machine <b>128</b>. The meal may be tested for levels of fat and fiber, among; other characteristics.</p>
<p id="p-0038" num="0037">As explained herein, the configuration of the system 10 is merely illustrative, and several of the machines <b>102</b>, <b>104</b>, <b>106</b>, <b>108</b>, <b>110</b>, <b>112</b>, <b>114</b>, <b>116</b>, <b>118</b>, <b>120</b>, <b>121</b>, <b>122</b>, <b>124</b>, <b>126</b>, and <b>128</b> may be reordered or omitted in other embodiments. Likewise, other machines may be added depending on the application. In particular, the extracting machine <b>114</b> or another module responsible for introducing solvent comprising ethyl alcohol or a nonpolar solvent could be moved to proximate or at any of the machines <b>116</b>, <b>118</b>, <b>120</b>, <b>121</b>, <b>122</b>, <b>124</b>, <b>126</b>, and <b>128</b> where desired. For instance, repositioning the extracting machine of another embodiment may be advantageous for space, energy, manpower, or efficiency considerations.</p>
<p id="p-0039" num="0038">Moreover, while the system <b>100</b> is shown in a configuration having particular application for soybean processing, other types of oilseed processing may similarly benefit from the techniques and solvents of the embodiments explained herein. For instance, canola oil processing may include prepressing canola meal. Corn oil processing may include machine to wet and dry mill co n prior to corn germ separation. Peanut oil processing may include additional cooking and prepressing machines. Still other embodiments may apply the method explained herein to ap plications outside of oilseed.</p>

More particularly, the steps of the flowchart may roughly correspond to the machines <b>102</b>, <b>104</b>, <b>106</b>, <b>108</b>, <b>110</b>, <b>112</b>, and <b>114</b> of the system <b>100</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0041" num="0040">Turning more particularly to the steps of the flowchart, the method <b>200</b> may include cleaning soybeans at block <b>202</b>. Related processes may include weighing and cleaning foreign matter and loose hulls. The soybeans may be graded at block <b>204</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0042" num="0041">An embodiment of the method <b>200</b> may dry the soybeans at <b>206</b>. The soybeans may be cracked at <b>208</b>.</p>

<p id="p-0049" num="0048">A solvent extraction method of oilseed processing may use an extraction solvent comprising ethyl alcohol or nonpolar solvent solutions that are combined to achieve the desired meal and oil characteristics. Oilseeds are cleaned, dried, dehulled, cracked, toasted and further prepared for oil extraction. The oilseeds are introduced to the oil extraction phase of processing. The oil is extracted from oilseed with the use of ethyl alcohol or nonpolar solvent solutions as th e extraction solvent. The extracted oil is then desolventized, resulting in the reduction or absence of residual solvent.</p>
