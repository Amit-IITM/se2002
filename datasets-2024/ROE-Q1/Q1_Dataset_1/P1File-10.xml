<heading id="h-0006" level="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION</heading>
<p id="p-0210" num="0207">As used herein, &#x201c;the&#x201d; may be used to mean &#x201c;the&#x201d; or &#x201c;the or each&#x201d; as appropriate. In particular, features described in relation to &#x201c;the at least one heating unit&#x201d; may be applicable to the first, second or further heating units where present. Further, features described in respect of a &#x201c;first&#x201d; or &#x201c;second&#x201d; integers may be equally applicable integers. For example, features described in respect of a &#x201c;first&#x201d; or &#x201c;second&#x201d; heating unit may be equally applicable to the other heating units in different embodiments. Similarly, features described in respect of a &#x201c;first&#x201d; or &#x201c;second&#x201d; mode of operation may be equally applicable to other configured modes of operation.</p>
<p id="p-0211" num="0208">In general, reference to a &#x201c;first&#x201d; heating unit in the heating assembly does not indicate that the heating assembly contains more than one heating unit, unless otherwise specified; rather, the heating assembly comprising a &#x201c;first&#x201d; heating unit must simply comprise at least one heating unit. Accordingly, a heating assembly containing only one heating unit expressly falls within the definition of a heating assembly comprising a &#x201c;first&#x201d; heating unit.</p>
<p id="p-0212" num="0209">Similarly, reference to a &#x201c;first&#x201d; and &#x201c;second&#x201d; heating unit in the heating assembly does not necessarily indicate that the heating assembly contains two heating units only; further heating units may be present. Rather, in this example, the heating assembly must simply comprise at least a first and a second heating unit.</p>
<p id="p-0213" num="0210">Where reference is made to an event such as reaching a maximum operating temperature occurring &#x201c;within&#x201d; a given period, the event may occur at any time between the beginning and the end of the period.</p>
<p id="p-0214" num="0211">As used herein, the term &#x201c;aerosol generating material&#x201d; includes materials that provide volatilised components upon heating, typically in the form of an aerosol. Aerosol generating material includes any tobacco-containing material and may, for example, include one or more of tobacco, tobacco derivatives, expanded tobacco, reconstituted tobacco or tobacco substitutes. Aerosol generating material also may include other, non-tobacco, products, which, depending on the product, may or may not contain nicotine. Aerosol generating material may for example be in the form of a solid, a liquid, a gel, a wax or the like. Aerosol generating material may for example also be a combination or a blend of materials. Aerosol generating material may also be known as &#x201c;smokable material&#x201d;. In an embodiment, the aerosol generating material is a non-liquid aerosol generating material. In a particular embodiment, the non-liquid aerosol generating material comprises tobacco.</p>
<p id="p-0215" num="0212">Apparatus is known that heats aerosol generating material to volatilise at least one component of the aerosol generating material, typically to form an aerosol which can be inhaled, without burning or combusting the aerosol generating material. Such apparatus is sometimes described as an &#x201c;aerosol generating device&#x201d;, an &#x201c;aerosol provision device&#x201d;, a &#x201c;heat-not-burn device&#x201d;, a &#x201c;tobacco heating product&#x201d;, a &#x201c;tobacco heating product device&#x201d;, a &#x201c;tobacco heating device&#x201d; or similar. In an embodiment the aerosol generating device is a tobacco heating product. The non-liquid aerosol generating material for use with a tobacco heating product comprises tobacco.</p>
<p id="p-0216" num="0213">Similarly, there are also so-called e-cigarette devices, which are typically aerosol generating devices which vaporise an aerosol generating material in the form of a liquid, which may or may not contain nicotine. The aerosol generating material may be in the form of or be provided as part of a rod, cartridge or cassette or the like which can be inserted into the apparatus. A heater for heating and volatilising the aerosol generating material may be provided as a &#x201c;permanent&#x201d; part of the apparatus.</p>
<p id="p-0217" num="0214">An aerosol generating device can receive an article comprising aerosol generating material for heating, also referred to as a &#x201c;smoking article&#x201d;. An &#x201c;article&#x201d;, &#x201c;aerosol generating article&#x201d; or &#x201c;smoking article&#x201d; in this context is a component that includes or contains in use the aerosol generating material, which is heated to volatilise the aerosol generating material, and optionally other components in use. A user may insert the article into the aerosol generating device before it is heated to produce an aerosol, which the user subsequently inhales. The article may be, for example, of a predetermined or specific size that is configured to be placed within a heating chamber of the device which is sized to receive the article.</p>
<p id="p-0218" num="0215">The aerosol generating device according to an embodiment comprises a plurality of heating units, each heating unit being arranged to heat, but not burn, the aerosol generating material in use.</p>
<p id="p-0219" num="0216">A heating unit typically refers to a component which is arranged to receive electrical energy from an electrical energy source, and to supply thermal energy to an aerosol generating material. A heating unit comprises a heating element. A heating element is typically a material which is arranged to supply heat to an aerosol generating material in use. The heating unit comprising the heating element may comprise any other component required, such as a component for transducing the electrical energy received by the heating unit. In other examples, the heating element itself may be configured to transduce electrical energy to thermal energy.</p>
<p id="p-0220" num="0217">The heating unit may comprise a coil. In some examples, the coil is configured to, in use, cause heating of at least one electrically-conductive heating element, so that heat energy is conductible from the at least one electrically-conductive heating element to aerosol generating material to thereby cause heating of the aerosol generating material.</p>
<p id="p-0221" num="0218">In some examples, the coil is configured to generate, in use, a varying magnetic field for penetrating at least one heating element, to thereby cause induction heating and/or magnetic hysteresis heating of the at least one heating element. In such an arrangement, the or each heating element may be termed a &#x201c;susceptor&#x201d;. A coil that is configured to generate, in use, a varying magnetic field for penetrating at least one electrically-conductive heating element, to thereby cause induction heating of the at least one electrically-conductive heating element, may be termed an &#x201c;induction coil&#x201d; or &#x201c;inductor coil&#x201d;.</p>
<p id="p-0222" num="0219">The device may include the heating element(s), for example electrically-conductive heating element(s), and the heating element(s) may be suitably located or locatable relative to the coil to enable such heating of the heating element(s). The heating element(s) may be in a fixed position relative to the coil. Alternatively, the at least one heating element, for example at least one electrically-conductive heating element, may be included in an article for insertion into a heating zone of the device, wherein the article also comprises the aerosol generating material and is removable from the heating zone after use. Alternatively, both the device and such an article may comprise at least one respective heating element, for example at least one electrically-conductive heating element, and the coil may be to cause heating of the heating element(s) of each of the device and the article when the article is in the heating zone.</p>
<p id="p-0223" num="0220">In some examples, the coil is helical. In some examples, the coil encircles at least a part of a heating zone of the device that is configured to receive aerosol generating material. In some examples, the coil is a helical coil that encircles at least a part of the heating zone.</p>
<p id="p-0224" num="0221">In some examples, the device comprises an electrically-conductive heating element that at least partially surrounds the heating zone, and the coil is a helical coil that encircles at least a part of the electrically-conductive heating element. In some examples, the electrically-conductive heating element is tubular. In some examples, the coil is an inductor coil.</p>
<p id="p-0225" num="0222">In some examples, the heating unit is an induction heating unit. Surprisingly, it has been found by the inventors that induction heating units in an aerosol generating device reach a maximum operating temperature much more rapidly than corresponding resistive heating elements. In an embodiment, the device is configured such that the first (induction) heating unit reaches its maximum operating temperature at a rate of at least 100&#xb0; C. per second. In a particular embodiment, the device is configured such that the first (induction) heating unit reaches the maximum operating temperature at a rate of at least 150&#xb0; C. per second.</p>
<p id="p-0226" num="0223">Induction heating systems may be of interest because the varying magnetic field magnitude can be easily controlled by controlling power supplied to the heating unit. Moreover, as induction heating does not require a physical connection to be provided between the source of the varying magnetic field and the heat source, design freedom and control over the heating profile may be greater, and cost may be lower.</p>
<p id="p-0227" num="0224">In other examples, the first and/or second heating unit may comprise a resistive heating unit. A resistive heating unit may consist of a resistive heating element. That is, it may be unnecessary for a resistive heating unit to include a separate component for transducing the electrical energy received by the heating unit, because a resistive heating element itself transduces electrical energy to thermal energy.</p>
<p id="p-0228" num="0225">Using electrical resistance heating systems may be of interest because the rate of heat generation is easier to control, and lower levels of heat are easier to generate, compared with using combustion for heat generation. The use of electrical heating systems therefore allows greater control over the generation of an aerosol from a tobacco composition.</p>
<p id="p-0229" num="0226">Reference is made to the temperature of heating elements throughout the present specification. The temperature of a heating element may also be conveniently referred to as the temperature of the heating unit which comprises the heating element. This does not necessarily mean that the entire heating unit is at the given temperature. For example, where reference is made to the temperature of an induction heating unit, it does not necessarily mean that the both the inductive element and the susceptor have such a temperature. Rather, in this example, the temperature of the induction heating unit corresponds to the temperature of the heating element composed in the induction heating unit. For the avoidance of doubt, the temperature of a heating element and the temperature of a heating unit can be used interchangeably.</p>
<p id="p-0230" num="0227">As used herein, &#x201c;temperature profile&#x201d; refers to the variation of temperature of a material over time. For example, the varying temperature of a heating element or heating unit measured at the heating element or heating unit for the duration of a smoking session may be referred to as the temperature profile of that heating element or heating unit. The heating elements or heating units provide heat to the aerosol generating material during use, to generate an aerosol. The temperature profile of the heating element or heating unit therefore induces the temperature profile of aerosol generating material disposed near the heating element or heating unit.</p>
<p id="p-0231" num="0228">As used herein, &#x201c;puff&#x201d; refers to a single inhalation by the user of the aerosol generated by the aerosol generating device.</p>
<p id="p-0232" num="0229">In use, the device may heat an aerosol generating material to provide an inhalable aerosol. The device may be referred to as &#x201c;ready for use&#x201d; when at least a portion of the aerosol generating material has reached a lowest operating temperature and a user can take a puff which contains a satisfactory amount of aerosol. In some embodiments the device may be ready for use within approximately 20 seconds of supplying power to the first heating unit, or 15 seconds, or 10 seconds. The device may be ready for use within approximately 20 seconds of activation of the device, or 15 seconds, or 10 seconds. The device may begin supplying power to a heating unit such as the first heating unit when the device is activated, or it may begin supplying power to the heating unit after the device is activated. The device may be configured such that power starts being supplied to the first heating unit some time after activation of the device, such as at least 1 second, 2 seconds or 3 seconds after activation of the device. The device may be configured such that power is not supplied to the first heating unit, or any heating unit present in the heating assembly until at least 2.5 seconds after activation of the device. This may prolong battery life by avoiding unintentional activation of the heating unit(s).</p>
<p id="p-0233" num="0230">The aerosol generating device may be ready for use more quickly than corresponding aerosol generating devices known in the art, providing an improved user experience. Generally, the point at which the device is ready for use will be some time after the first heating unit has reached its maximum operating temperature, as it will take some amount of time to transfer sufficient thermal energy from the heating unit to the aerosol generating material in order to generate the aerosol. The device may be ready for use within 20 seconds of the first heating unit reaching its maximum operating temperature, or 15 seconds, or 10 seconds.</p>
<p id="p-0234" num="0231">Further, surprisingly it has been found that characteristics of the aerosol generated from the aerosol generating material may depend on the rate at which the aerosol generating material is heated. For example, the aerosol generated from an aerosol generating material which is subject to heating from a heating unit which is configured to change temperature quickly may provide an improved user experience. In one embodiment wherein the aerosol generating material comprises menthol, it has been found that rapidly increasing the temperature of the heating unit may increase the rate at which menthol is delivered to a user in the aerosol, and thereby reduce the amount of menthol component that is wasted (i.e. does not form part of the aerosol inhaled by a user) from static heating.</p>
<p id="p-0235" num="0232">In some embodiments, the user's sensorial experience arising from the aerosol generated by the present device is like that of smoking a combustible cigarette, such as a factory-made cigarette.</p>
<p id="p-0236" num="0233">The device may indicate that it is ready for use via an indicator. In an embodiment, the device may be configured such that the indicator indicates that the device is ready for use within approximately 20 seconds of power being supplied to the first heating unit, or 15 seconds, or 10 seconds. In a particular embodiment, the device is configured such that the indicator indicates that the device is ready for use within approximately 20 seconds of activation of the device, or 15 seconds, or 10 seconds. In another embodiment, the device is configured such that the indicator indicates that the device is ready for use within approximately 20 seconds of the first heating unit reaching its maximum operating temperature, or 15 seconds, or 10 seconds.</p>
<p id="p-0237" num="0234">&#x201c;Session of use&#x201d; as used herein refers to a single period of use of the aerosol generating device by a user. The session of use begins at the point at which power is first supplied to at least one heating unit present in the heating assembly. The device will be ready for use after a period of time has elapsed from the start of the session of use.</p>
<p id="p-0238" num="0235">The session of use ends at the point at which no power is supplied to any of the heating units in the aerosol generating device. The end of the session of use may coincide with the point at which the aerosol generating article is depleted (the point at which the total particulate matter yield (mg) in each puff would be deemed unacceptably low by a user). The session may comprise a plurality of puffs. The session may have a duration less than 7 minutes, or 6 minutes, or 5 minutes, or 4 minutes and 30 seconds, or 4 minutes, or 3 minutes and 30 seconds. In some embodiments, the session of use may have a duration of from 2 to 5 minutes, or from 3 to 4.5 minutes, or 3.5 to 4.5 minutes, or suitably 4 minutes. A session may be initiated by the user actuating a button or switch on the device, causing at least one heating unit to begin rising in temperature when activated or some time after activation.</p>
<p id="p-0239" num="0236">&#x201c;Operating temperature&#x201d; as used herein in relation to a heating element or heating unit refers to any heating element temperature at which the element can heat an aerosol generating material to produce sufficient aerosol for a satisfactory puff without burning the aerosol generating material. The maximum operating temperature of a heating element is the highest temperature reached by the element during a smoking session. The lowest operating temperature of the heating element refers to the lowest heating element temperature at which sufficient aerosol can be generated from the aerosol generating material by the heating element for a satisfactory puff. Where there is a plurality of heating elements or heating units present in the aerosol generating device, each heating element or heating unit has an associated maximum operating temperature. The maximum operating temperature of each heating element or heating unit may be the same, or it may differ for each heating element or heating unit.</p>
<p id="p-0240" num="0237">In the aerosol generating device according to an embodiment each heating element or heating unit may be arranged to heat, but not burn, aerosol generating material. Although the temperature profile of each heating element or heating unit may induce the temperature profile of each associated portion of aerosol generating material, the temperature profiles of the heating element or heating unit and the associated portion of aerosol generating material may not exactly correspond. For example: there may be &#x201c;bleed&#x201d; in the form of conduction, convection and/or radiation of heat energy from one portion of the aerosol generating material to another; there may be variations in conduction, convection and/or radiation of heat energy from the heating elements or heating units to the aerosol generating material; there may be a lag between the change in the temperature profile of the heating element or heating unit and the change in the temperature profile of the aerosol generating material, depending on the heat capacity of the aerosol generating material.</p>
<p id="p-0241" num="0238">The device may comprise a controller for controlling each heating unit present in the device. The controller may comprise a PCB. The controller may be configured to control the power supplied to each heating unit, and controls the &#x201c;programmed heating profile&#x201d; of each heating unit present in the device. For example, the controller may be programmed to control the current supplied to a plurality of inductors to control the resulting temperature profiles of the corresponding induction heating elements or induction heating units. As between the temperature profile of heating elements/units and aerosol generating material described above, the programmed heating profile of a heating element or heating unit may not exactly correspond to the observed temperature profile of a heating element or heating unit, for the same reasons given above.</p>
<p id="p-0242" num="0239">The term &#x201c;operating temperature&#x201d; can also be used in relation to the aerosol generating material. In this case, the term refers to any temperature of the aerosol generating material itself at which sufficient aerosol is generated from the aerosol generating material for a satisfactory puff. The maximum operating temperature of the aerosol generating material is the highest temperature reached by any part of the aerosol generating material during a smoking session. In some embodiments, the maximum operating temperature of the aerosol generating material is greater than 200&#xb0; C., 210&#xb0; C., 220&#xb0; C., 230&#xb0; C., 240&#xb0; C., 250&#xb0; C., 260&#xb0; C., or 270&#xb0; C. In some embodiments, the maximum operating temperature of the aerosol generating material is less than 300&#xb0; C., 290&#xb0; C., 280&#xb0; C., 270&#xb0; C., 260&#xb0; C., 250&#xb0; C. The lowest operating temperature is the lowest temperature of aerosol generating material at which sufficient aerosol is generated from the material to product sufficient aerosol for a satisfactory &#x201c;puff&#x201d;. In some embodiments, the lowest operating temperature of the aerosol generating material is greater than 90&#xb0; C., 100&#xb0; C., 110&#xb0; C., 120&#xb0; C., 130&#xb0; C., 140&#xb0; C. or 150&#xb0; C. In some embodiments, the lowest operating temperature of the aerosol generating material is less than 150&#xb0; C., 140&#xb0; C., 130&#xb0; C., or 120&#xb0; C.</p>
<p id="p-0243" num="0240">An object of various embodiments is to reduce the amount of time it takes for an aerosol generating device to be ready for use, and more generally improve the inhalation experience for a user. Surprisingly, it has been found that reducing the time taken for a heating element or heating unit to reach an operating temperature may at least partially alleviate &#x201c;hot puff&#x201d;, a phenomenon which occurs when the generated aerosol contains a high water content. Accordingly, the aerosol generating device according to various embodiments may provide an inhalable aerosol to a consumer which has better organoleptic properties than an aerosol provided by a conventional aerosol generating device which does not include a heating unit which reaches a maximum operating temperature as rapidly.</p>
<p id="p-0244" num="0241">In some embodiments, the device is configured such that at least one heating element in the device reaches its maximum operating temperature within 20 seconds, and the first temperature at which the at least one heating unit is held for at least 1 second, 2 seconds, 3 seconds, 4 seconds, 5 seconds, 10 seconds, or 20 seconds is the maximum operating temperature. That is, in these embodiments, the heating unit is not held at a temperature which is not the maximum operating temperature before reaching the maximum operating temperature.</p>
<p id="p-0245" num="0242">In some embodiments, the at least one heating unit reaches its maximum operating temperature within the given period from ambient temperature.</p>
<p id="p-0246" num="0243">The device may be configured to operate as described herein. The device may at least partially be configured to operate in this manner by a controller which may be programmed to operate the device in one or more different modes. Accordingly, references herein to the configuration of the device or components thereof may refer to the controller being programmed to operate the device as disclosed herein, amongst other features (such as spatial arrangement of the heating units).</p>
<p id="p-0247" num="0244">Aerosol generating articles for aerosol generating devices (such as tobacco heating products) usually contain more water and/or aerosol generating agent than combustible smoking articles to facilitate formation of an aerosol in use. This higher water and/or aerosol generating agent content can increase the risk of condensate collecting within the aerosol generating device during use, particularly in locations away from the heating unit(s). This problem may be greater in devices with enclosed heating chambers, and particularly those with external heaters, than those provided with internal heaters (such as &#x201c;blade&#x201d; heaters). Without wishing to be bound by theory, it is believed that since a greater proportion/surface area of the aerosol generating material is heated by external-heating heating assemblies, more aerosol is released than a device which heats the aerosol generating material internally, leading to more condensation of the aerosol within the device. The inventors have found that programmed heating profiles of the present disclosure may be employed in a device configured to externally heat aerosol generating material to provide a desirable amount of aerosol to the user whilst keeping the amount of aerosol which condenses inside the device low. For example, the maximum operating temperature of a heating unit may affect the amount of condensate formed. It may be that lower maximum operating temperatures provide less undesirable condensate. The difference between maximum operating temperatures of heating units in a heating assembly may also affect the amount of condensate formed. Further, the point in a session of use at which each heating unit reaches its maximum operating temperature may affect the amount of condensate formed.</p>
<p id="p-0248" num="0245">In some embodiments, the device is operable in at least a first (e.g. base) mode and a second (e.g. boost) mode.</p>
<p id="p-0249" num="0246">The heating assembly may be operable in a maximum of two modes, or may be operable in more than two modes, such as three modes, four modes, or five modes.</p>
<p id="p-0250" num="0247">Each mode may be associated with a predetermined heating profile for each heating unit in the heating assembly, such as a programmed heating profile. One or more of the programmed heating profiles may be programmed by a user. Additionally, or alternatively, one or more of the programmed heating profiles may be programmed by the manufacturer. In these examples, the one or more programmed heating profiles may be fixed such that an end user cannot alter the one or more programmed heating profiles.</p>
<p id="p-0251" num="0248">The modes of operation may be selectable by a user. For example, the user may select a desired mode of operation by interacting with a user interface. Power may begin to be supplied to the first heating unit at substantially the same time as the desired mode of operation is selected.</p>
<p id="p-0252" num="0249">Each mode may be associated with a temperature profile which differs from the temperature profiles of the other modes. Further, one or more modes may be associated with a different point at which the device is ready for use. For example, the heating assembly may configured such that, in the first mode, the device is ready for use a first period of time after the start of a session of use, and in the second mode, the device is ready for use a second period of time after the start of the session. The first period of time may be different from the second period of time. The second period of time associated with the second mode may be shorter than the first period of time associated with the second mode.</p>
<p id="p-0253" num="0250">In some examples, the heating assembly is configured such that the device is ready for use within 30, 25 seconds, 20 seconds or 15 seconds of supplying power to the first heating unit when operated in the first mode. The heating assembly may also be configured such that the device is ready for use in a shorter period of time when operating in the second mode&#x2014;within 25 seconds, 20 seconds, 15 seconds, or 10 seconds of supplying power to the first heating unit when operating in the second mode. The heating assembly may be configured such that the device is ready for use within 20 seconds of supplying power to the first heating unit when operated in the first mode, and within 10 seconds of supplying power to the second heating unit when operated in the second mode. The second mode of this embodiment may also be associated with the first and/or second heating unit having a higher maximum operating temperature in use.</p>
<p id="p-0254" num="0251">In a particular embodiment, the device is configured such that the indicator indicates that the device is ready for use within 20 seconds of selection of the first (e.g. base) mode, and within 10 seconds of selection of the second (e.g. boost) mode.</p>
<p id="p-0255" num="0252">Providing an aerosol generating device such as a tobacco heating product with a heating assembly that is operable in a plurality of modes (e.g. base mode and boost mode) gives more choice to the consumer, particularly where each mode is associated with a different maximum heater temperature. Moreover, such a device is capable of providing different aerosols having differing characteristics, because volatile components in the aerosol generating material will be volatilised at different rates and concentrations at different heater temperatures. This allows a user to select a particular mode based on a desired characteristic of the inhalable aerosol, such as degree of tobacco flavour, nicotine concentration, and aerosol temperature. For example, modes in which the device is ready for use more quickly (e.g. a second or &#x201c;boost&#x201d; mode) may provide a quicker first puff, or a greater nicotine content per puff, or a more concentrated flavour per puff. Conversely, modes in which the device is ready for use at a later point in the session (e.g. a first or base mode) of use may provide a longer overall session of use, lower nicotine content per puff, and more sustained delivery of flavour.</p>
<p id="p-0256" num="0253">In embodiments wherein the device is ready for use more quickly in a second (e.g. boost) mode, and/or the first and/or second heating unit has a higher maximum operating temperature in the second mode, the second mode may be referred to as a &#x201c;boost&#x201d; mode. For the first time, aspects provide an aerosol generating device which is operable in a first &#x201c;normal&#x201d; mode, and a second &#x201c;boost&#x201d; mode. The &#x201c;boost&#x201d; mode may provide a quicker first puff, or a greater nicotine content per puff, or a more concentrated flavour per puff.</p>
<p id="p-0257" num="0254">The device may comprise a maximum of two heating units. In other examples, the device may comprise more than two independently controllable heating units, such as three, four or five independently controllable heating units.</p>
<p id="p-0258" num="0255">The device may be configured such that each heating unit present in the device reaches a first-mode maximum operating temperature in the first mode, and a second-mode maximum operating temperature in the second mode. For example, the second heating unit may reach a first-mode maximum operating temperature in the first mode, and a second-mode maximum operating temperature in the second mode. The maximum operating temperature of each heating unit in each mode may be the same, or may be different. For example, the maximum operating temperature of the second heating unit in each mode may or may not be the same as the maximum operating temperature of the first heating unit in each mode.</p>
<p id="p-0259" num="0256">As discussed hereinabove, in some embodiments, at least one of the heating units provided in the heating assembly may comprise an induction heating unit. In these embodiments, the heating unit comprises an inductor (for example, one or more inductor coils), and the device may be arranged to pass a varying electrical current, such as an alternating current, through the inductor. The varying electric current in the inductor produces a varying magnetic field. When the inductor and the heating element are suitably relatively positioned so that the varying magnetic field produced by the inductor penetrates the heating element, one or more eddy currents are generated inside the heating element. The heating element has a resistance to the flow of electrical currents, so when such eddy currents are generated in the object, their flow against the electrical resistance of the object causes the object to be heated by Joule heating. Supplying a varying magnetic field to a susceptor may conveniently be referred to as supplying energy to a susceptor.</p>
<p id="p-0260" num="0257">The first and second heating units (which may comprise induction or resistive heating units) may be controllable independent from each other. Heating the aerosol generating material with independent heating units may provide more accurate control of heating of the aerosol generating material. Independently controllable heating units may also provide thermal energy differently to each portion of the aerosol generating material, resulting in differing temperature profiles across portions of the aerosol generating material. In particular embodiments, the first and second heating units are configured to have temperature profiles which differ from each other in use. This may provide asymmetrical heating of the aerosol generating material along a longitudinal plane between the mouth end and the distal end of the device when the device is in use.</p>
<p id="p-0261" num="0258">An object that is capable of being inductively heated is known as a susceptor. In cases where the susceptor comprises ferromagnetic material such as iron, nickel or cobalt, heat may also be generated by magnetic hysteresis losses in the susceptor, i.e. by the varying orientation of magnetic dipoles in the magnetic material as a result of their alignment with the varying magnetic field. In inductive heating, as compared to heating by conduction for example, heat is generated inside the susceptor, allowing for rapid heating. Further, there need not be any physical contact between the inductive heater and the susceptor, allowing for enhanced freedom in construction and application.</p>
<p id="p-0262" num="0259">The heating element may comprise a susceptor. In embodiments, the susceptor comprises a plurality of heating elements&#x2014;at least a first induction heating element and a second induction heating element.</p>
<p id="p-0263" num="0260">In other embodiments, the heating units are not limited to induction heating units. For example, the first heating unit may comprise an electrical resistance heating unit which may consist of a resistive heating element. The second heating unit may additionally or alternatively be an electrical resistance heating unit which may consist of a resistive heating element. By &#x201c;resistive heating element&#x201d;, it is meant that on application of a current to the element, resistance in the element transduces electrical energy into thermal energy which heats the aerosol generating substrate. The heating element may be in the form of a resistive wire, mesh, coil and/or a plurality of wires. The heat source may comprise a thin-film heater.</p>
<p id="p-0264" num="0261">The heating element may comprise a metal or metal alloy. Metals are excellent conductors of electricity and thermal energy. Suitable metals include but are not limited to: copper, aluminium, platinum, tungsten, gold, silver, and titanium. Suitable metal alloys include but are not limited to: nichrome and stainless steel.</p>
<p id="p-0265" num="0262">Another aspect is an aerosol generating system comprising an aerosol generating device as described herein in combination with an aerosol generating article. In an embodiment, the aerosol generating system comprises a tobacco heating product in combination with an aerosol generating article comprising tobacco.

<p id="p-0267" num="0264">The heating assembly <b>100</b> has a first or proximal or mouth end <b>102</b>, and a second or distal end <b>104</b>. In use, the user will inhale the formed aerosol from the mouth end of the aerosol generating device. The mouth end may be an open end.</p>
<p id="p-0268" num="0265">The heating assembly <b>100</b> comprises a first induction heating unit <b>110</b> and a second induction heating unit <b>120</b>. The first induction heating unit <b>110</b> comprises a first inductor coil <b>112</b> and a first heating element <b>114</b>.

<p id="p-0269" num="0266"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>1</b>A and <b>1</b>B</figref> show an aerosol generating article <b>130</b> received within a susceptor <b>140</b> (see <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b>B</figref>). The susceptor <b>140</b> forms the first induction heating element <b>114</b> and the second induction heating element <b>124</b>. The susceptor <b>140</b> may be formed from any material suitable for heating by induction. For example, the susceptor <b>140</b> may comprise metal. In some embodiments, the susceptor <b>140</b> may comprise non-ferrous metal such as copper, nickel, titanium, aluminium, tin, or zinc, and/or ferrous material such as iron, nickel or cobalt. Additionally or alternatively the susceptor <b>140</b> may comprise a semiconductor such as silicon carbide, carbon or graphite.</p>
<p id="p-0270" num="0267">Each induction heating element present in the aerosol generating device may have any suitable shape. In the embodiment shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b>B</figref>, the induction heating elements <b>114</b>,<b>124</b> define a receptacle to surround an aerosol generating article and heat the aerosol generating article externally. In other embodiments (not shown), one or more induction heating elements may be substantially elongate, arranged to penetrate an aerosol generating article and heat the aerosol generating article internally.</p>
<p id="p-0271" num="0268">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b>B</figref>, the first induction heating element <b>114</b> and second induction heating element <b>124</b> may be provided together as a monolithic element <b>140</b>. That is, in some embodiments, there is no physical distinction between the first <b>114</b> and second <b>124</b> heating elements. Rather, the differing characteristics between the first and second heating units <b>110</b>, <b>120</b> are defined by separate inductor coils <b>112</b>,<b>122</b> surrounding each induction heating element <b>114</b>,<b>124</b>, so that they may be controlled independently from each other. In other embodiments (not depicted), physically distinct inductive heating elements may be employed.</p>
<p id="p-0272" num="0269">The first and second inductor coils <b>112</b>,<b>122</b> may be made from an electrically conducting material. In this example, the first and second inductor coils <b>112</b>,<b>122</b> are made from Litz wire/cable which is wound in a helical fashion to provide helical inductor coils <b>112</b>,<b>122</b>. Litz wire comprises a plurality of individual wires which are individually insulated and are twisted together to form a single wire. Litz wires are designed to reduce the skin effect losses in a conductor. In the example induction heating assembly <b>100</b>, the first and second inductor coils <b>124</b>,<b>126</b> are made from copper Litz wire which has a circular cross section. In other examples the Litz wire can have other shape cross sections, such as rectangular.</p>
<p id="p-0273" num="0270">The first inductor coil <b>112</b> is configured to generate a first varying magnetic field for heating the first induction heating element <b>114</b>, and the second inductor coil <b>122</b> is configured to generate a second varying magnetic field for heating a second section of the susceptor <b>124</b>. The first inductor coil <b>112</b> and the first induction heating element <b>114</b> taken together form a first induction heating unit <b>110</b>. Similarly, the second inductor coil <b>122</b> and the second induction heating element <b>124</b> taken together form a second induction heating unit <b>120</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0274" num="0271">In this example, the first inductor coil <b>112</b> is adjacent to the second inductor coil <b>122</b> in a direction along the longitudinal axis of the device heating assembly <b>100</b> (that is, the first and second inductor coils <b>112</b>,<b>122</b> do not overlap). The susceptor arrangement <b>140</b> may comprise a single susceptor. Ends <b>150</b> of the first and second inductor coils <b>112</b>,<b>122</b> can be connected to a controller such as a PCB (not shown). In embodiments, the controller comprises a PID controller (proportional integral derivative controller).</p>
<p id="p-0275" num="0272">The varying magnetic field generates eddy currents within the first inductive heating element <b>114</b>, thereby rapidly heating the first induction heating element <b>114</b> to a maximum operating temperature within a short period of time from supplying the alternative current to the coil <b>112</b>, for example within 20, 15, 12, 10, 5, or 2 seconds. Arranging the first induction heating unit <b>110</b> which is configured to rapidly reach a maximum operating temperature closer to the mouth end <b>102</b> of the heating assembly <b>100</b> than the second induction heating unit <b>120</b> may mean that an acceptable aerosol is provided to a user as soon as possible after initiation of a session of use.</p>
<p id="p-0276" num="0273">It will be appreciated that the first and second inductor coils <b>112</b>,<b>122</b>, in some examples, may have at least one characteristic different from each other. For example, the first inductor coil <b>112</b> may have at least one characteristic different from the second inductor coil <b>122</b>. More specifically, in one example, the first inductor coil <b>112</b> may have a different value of inductance than the second inductor coil <b>122</b>. In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>1</b>A and <b>1</b>B</figref>, the first and second inductor coils <b>112</b>,<b>122</b> are of different lengths such that the first inductor coil <b>112</b> is wound over a smaller section of the susceptor <b>140</b> than the second inductor coil <b>122</b>. Thus, the first inductor coil <b>112</b> may comprise a different number of turns than the second inductor coil <b>122</b> (assuming that the spacing between individual turns is substantially the same). In yet another example, the first inductor coil <b>112</b> may be made from a different material to the second inductor coil <b>122</b>. In some examples, the first and second inductor coils <b>112</b>,<b>122</b> may be substantially identical.</p>
<p id="p-0277" num="0274">In this example, the first inductor coil <b>112</b> and the second inductor coil <b>122</b> are wound in the same direction. However, in another embodiment, the inductor coils <b>112</b>,<b>122</b> may be wound in opposite directions. This can be useful when the inductor coils are active at different times. For example, initially, the first inductor coil <b>112</b> may be operating to heat the first induction heating element <b>114</b>, and at a later time, the second inductor coil <b>122</b> may be operating to heat the second induction heating element <b>124</b>. Winding the coils in opposite directions helps reduce the current induced in the inactive coil when used in conjunction with a particular type of control circuit. In one example, the first inductor coil <b>112</b> may be a right-hand helix and the second inductor coil <b>122</b> a left-hand helix. In another example, the first inductor coil <b>112</b> may be a left-hand helix and the second inductor coil <b>122</b> may be a right-hand helix.</p>
<p id="p-0278" num="0275">The coils <b>112</b>,<b>122</b> may have any suitable geometry. Without wishing to be bound by theory, configuring an induction heating element to be smaller (e.g. smaller pitch helix; fewer revolutions in the helix; shorter overall length of the helix), may increase the rate at which the induction heating element can reach a maximum operating temperature. In some embodiments, the first coil <b>112</b> may have a length of less than approximately 20 mm, less than 18 mm, less than 16 mm, or a length of approximately 14 mm, in the longitudinal direction of the heating assembly <b>100</b>. The first coil <b>112</b> may have a length shorter than the second coil <b>124</b> in the longitudinal direction of the heating assembly <b>100</b>. Such an arrangement may provide asymmetrical heating of the aerosol generating article along the length of the aerosol generating article.</p>

<p id="p-0293" num="0290">The &#x201c;aerosol generating agent&#x201d; is an agent that promotes the generation of an aerosol. An aerosol generating agent may promote the generation of an aerosol by promoting an initial vaporisation and/or the condensation of a gas to an inhalable solid and/or liquid aerosol. In some embodiments, an aerosol generating agent may improve the delivery of flavour from the aerosol generating article.</p>
<p id="p-0294" num="0291">In general, any suitable aerosol generating agent or agents may be included in the aerosol generating material.

<p id="p-0296" num="0293">In one example, the body of aerosol generating material <b>202</b> is between 34 mm and 50 mm in length, optionally, the body of aerosol generating material <b>202</b> is between 38 mm and 46 mm in length, optionally still, the body of aerosol generating material <b>202</b> is 42 mm in length.</p>
<p id="p-0297" num="0294">In one example, the total length of the article <b>200</b> is between 71 mm and 95 mm, optionally, total length of the article <b>200</b> is between 79 mm and 87 mm, optionally still, total length of the article <b>200</b> is 83 mm.</p>
<p id="p-0298" num="0295">An axial end of the body of aerosol generating material <b>202</b> is visible at the distal end <b>214</b> of the article <b>200</b>. However, in other embodiments, the distal end <b>214</b> of the article <b>200</b> may comprise an end member (not shown) covering the axial end of the body of aerosol generating material <b>202</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0299" num="0296">The body of aerosol generating material <b>202</b> is joined to the filter assembly <b>204</b> by annular tipping paper (not shown), which is located substantially around the circumference of the filter assembly <b>204</b> to surround the filter assembly <b>204</b> and extends partially along the length of the body of aerosol generating material <b>202</b>. In one example, the tipping paper is made of 58GSM standard tipping base paper. In one example has a length of between 42 mm and 50 mm, and optionally, the tipping paper has a length of 46 mm.</p>
<p id="p-0300" num="0297">In one example, the cooling segment <b>206</b> is an annular tube and is located around and defines an air gap within the cooling segment. The air gap provides a chamber for heated volatilised components generated from the body of aerosol generating material <b>202</b> to flow. The cooling segment <b>206</b> is hollow to provide a chamber for aerosol accumulation yet rigid enough to withstand axial compressive forces and bending moments that might arise during manufacture and whilst the article <b>200</b> is in use during insertion into the device <b>100</b>. In one example, the thickness of the wall of the cooling segment <b>206</b> is approximately 0.29 mm.</p>
<p id="p-0301" num="0298">The cooling segment <b>206</b> provides a physical displacement between the aerosol generating material <b>202</b> and the filter segment <b>208</b>. The physical displacement provided by the cooling segment <b>206</b> will provide a thermal gradient across the length of the cooling segment <b>206</b>. In one example the cooling segment <b>206</b> is configured to provide a temperature differential of at least 40&#xb0; C. between a heated volatilised component entering a first end of the cooling segment <b>206</b> and a heated volatilised component exiting a second end of the cooling segment <b>206</b>. In one example the cooling segment <b>206</b> is configured to provide a temperature differential of at least 60&#xb0; C. between a heated volatilised component entering a first end of the cooling segment <b>206</b> and a heated volatilised component exiting a second end of the cooling segment <b>206</b>. This temperature differential across the length of the cooling element <b>206</b> protects the temperature sensitive filter segment <b>208</b> from the high temperatures of the aerosol generating material <b>202</b> when it is heated by the heating assembly <b>100</b> of the device aerosol generating device. If the physical displacement was not provided between the filter segment <b>208</b> and the body of aerosol generating material <b>202</b> and the heating elements <b>114</b>,<b>124</b> of the heating assembly <b>100</b>, then the temperature sensitive filter segment may <b>208</b> become damaged in use, so it would not perform its required functions as effectively.</p>
<p id="p-0302" num="0299">In one example the length of the cooling segment <b>206</b> is at least 15 mm. In one example, the length of the cooling segment <b>206</b> is between 20 mm and 30 mm, more particularly 23 mm to 27 mm, more particularly 25 mm to 27 mm and more particularly 25 mm.</p>
<p id="p-0303" num="0300">The cooling segment <b>206</b> is made of paper, which means that it is comprised of a material that does not generate compounds of concern, for example, toxic compounds when in use adjacent to the heater assembly <b>100</b> of the aerosol generating device. In one example, the cooling segment <b>206</b> is manufactured from a spirally wound paper tube which provides a hollow internal chamber yet maintains mechanical rigidity. Spirally wound paper tubes are able to meet the tight dimensional accuracy requirements of high-speed manufacturing processes with respect to tube length, outer diameter, roundness and straightness.</p>
<p id="p-0304" num="0301">In another example, the cooling segment <b>206</b> is a recess created from stiff plug wrap or tipping paper. The stiff plug wrap or tipping paper is manufactured to have a rigidity that is sufficient to withstand the axial compressive forces and bending moments that might arise during manufacture and whilst the article <b>200</b> is in use during insertion into the device <b>100</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0305" num="0302">For each of the examples of the cooling segment <b>206</b>, the dimensional accuracy of the cooling segment is sufficient to meet the dimensional accuracy requirements of high-speed manufacturing process.</p>
<p id="p-0306" num="0303">The filter segment <b>208</b> may be formed of any filter material sufficient to remove one or more volatilised compounds from heated volatilised components from the smokable material. In one example the filter segment <b>208</b> is made of a mono-acetate material, such as cellulose acetate. The filter segment <b>208</b> provides cooling and irritation-reduction from the heated volatilised components without depleting the quantity of the heated volatilised components to an unsatisfactory level for a user.</p>
<p id="p-0307" num="0304">The density of the cellulose acetate tow material of the filter segment <b>208</b> controls the pressure drop across the filter segment <b>208</b>, which in turn controls the draw resistance of the article <b>200</b>. Therefore, the selection of the material of the filter segment <b>208</b> is important in controlling the resistance to draw of the article <b>200</b>. In addition, the filter segment <b>208</b> performs a filtration function in the article <b>200</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0308" num="0305">In one example, the filter segment <b>208</b> is made of a 8Y15 grade of filter tow material, which provides a filtration effect on the heated volatilised material, whilst also reducing the size of condensed aerosol droplets which result from the heated volatilised material which consequentially reduces the irritation and throat impact of the heated volatilised material to satisfactory levels.</p>
<p id="p-0309" num="0306">The presence of the filter segment <b>208</b> provides an insulating effect by providing further cooling to the heated volatilised components that exit the cooling segment <b>206</b>. This further cooling effect reduces the contact temperature of the user's lips on the surface of the filter segment <b>208</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0310" num="0307">One or more flavours may be added to the filter segment <b>208</b> in the form of either direct injection of flavoured liquids into the filter segment <b>208</b> or by embedding or arranging one or more flavoured breakable capsules or other flavour carriers within the cellulose acetate tow of the filter segment <b>208</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0311" num="0308">In one example, the filter segment <b>208</b> is between 6 mm to 10 mm in length, optionally 8 mm.</p>
<p id="p-0312" num="0309">The mouth end segment <b>210</b> is an annular tube and is located around and defines an air gap within the mouth end segment <b>210</b>. The air gap provides a chamber for heated volatilised components that flow from the filter segment <b>208</b>. The mouth end segment <b>210</b> is hollow to provide a chamber for aerosol accumulation yet rigid enough to withstand axial compressive forces and bending moments that might arise during manufacture and whilst the article is in use during insertion into the device <b>100</b>. In one example, the thickness of the wall of the mouth end segment <b>210</b> is approximately 0.29 mm.</p>
<p id="p-0313" num="0310">In one example, the length of the mouth end segment <b>210</b> is between 6 mm to 10 mm and optionally 8 mm. In one example, the thickness of the mouth end segment is 0.29 mm.</p>
<p id="p-0314" num="0311">The mouth end segment <b>210</b> may be manufactured from a spirally wound paper tube which provides a hollow internal chamber yet maintains critical mechanical rigidity. Spirally wound paper tubes are able to meet the tight dimensional accuracy requirements of high-speed manufacturing processes with respect to tube length, outer diameter, roundness and straightness.</p>
<p id="p-0315" num="0312">The mouth end segment <b>210</b> provides the function of preventing any liquid condensate that accumulates at the exit of the filter segment <b>208</b> from coming into direct contact with a user.</p>
<p id="p-0316" num="0313">It should be appreciated that, in one example, the mouth end segment <b>210</b> and the cooling segment <b>206</b> may be formed of a single tube and the filter segment <b>208</b> is located within that tube separating the mouth end segment <b>210</b> and the cooling segment <b>206</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0317" num="0314">A ventilation region <b>216</b> is provided in the article <b>200</b> to enable air to flow into the interior of the article <b>200</b> from the exterior of the article <b>200</b>. In one example the ventilation region <b>216</b> takes the form of one or more ventilation holes <b>216</b> formed through the outer layer of the article <b>200</b>. The ventilation holes may be located in the cooling segment <b>206</b> to aid with the cooling of the article <b>200</b>. In one example, the ventilation region <b>216</b> comprises one or more rows of holes, and optionally, each row of holes is arranged circumferentially around the article <b>200</b> in a cross-section that is substantially perpendicular to a longitudinal axis of the article <b>200</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0318" num="0315">In one example, there are between one to four rows of ventilation holes to provide ventilation for the article <b>200</b>. Each row of ventilation holes may have between 12 to 36 ventilation holes <b>216</b>. The ventilation holes <b>216</b> may, for example, be between 100 to 500 &#x3bc;m in diameter. In one example, an axial separation between rows of ventilation holes <b>216</b> is between 0.25 mm and 0.75 mm, optionally, an axial separation between rows of ventilation holes <b>216</b> is 0.5 mm.</p>
<p id="p-0319" num="0316">In one example, the ventilation holes <b>216</b> are of uniform size. In another example, the ventilation holes <b>216</b> vary in size. The ventilation holes can be made using any suitable technique, for example, one or more of the following techniques: laser technology, mechanical perforation of the cooling segment <b>206</b> or pre-perforation of the cooling segment <b>206</b> before it is formed into the article <b>200</b>. The ventilation holes <b>216</b> are positioned so as to provide effective cooling to the article <b>200</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0320" num="0317">In one example, the rows of ventilation holes <b>216</b> are located at least 11 mm from the proximal end <b>212</b> of the article, optionally the ventilation holes are located between 17 mm and 20 mm from the proximal end <b>212</b> of the article <b>200</b>. The location of the ventilation holes <b>216</b> is positioned such that user does not block the ventilation holes <b>216</b> when the article <b>200</b> is in use.</p>
<p id="p-0321" num="0318">Providing the rows of ventilation holes between 17 mm and 20 mm from the proximal end <b>212</b> of the article <b>200</b> enables the ventilation holes <b>216</b> to be located outside of the device <b>100</b>, when the article <b>200</b> is fully inserted in the device <b>100</b>, as can be seen in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>. By locating the ventilation holes outside of the apparatus, non-heated air is able to enter the article <b>200</b> through the ventilation holes from outside the device <b>100</b> to aid with the cooling of the article <b>200</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0322" num="0319">The length of the cooling segment <b>206</b> is such that the cooling segment <b>206</b> will be partially inserted into the device <b>100</b>, when the article <b>200</b> is fully inserted into the device <b>100</b>. The length of the cooling segment <b>206</b> provides a first function of providing a physical gap between the heater arrangement of the device <b>100</b> and the heat sensitive filter arrangement <b>208</b>, and a second function of enabling the ventilation holes <b>216</b> to be located in the cooling segment, whilst also being located outside of the device <b>100</b>, when the article <b>200</b> is fully inserted into the device <b>100</b>. As can be seen from <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>, the majority of the cooling element <b>206</b> is located within the device <b>100</b>.

The temperature profile <b>300</b> suitably refers to the temperature profile of the first inductive heating element <b>114</b> in any mode of operation of the heating assembly. The temperature profile <b>300</b> of the first heating element <b>114</b> is measured by a suitable temperature sensor disposed at the first heating element <b>114</b>. Suitable temperature sensors include thermocouples, thermopiles or resistance temperature detectors (RTDs, also referred to as resistance thermometers). In a particular embodiment, the device comprises at least one RTD. In an embodiment, the device comprises thermocouples arranged on each heating element <b>114</b>,<b>124</b> present in the aerosol generating device. The temperature data measured by the or each temperature sensor may be communicated to a controller. Further, it may communicated to the controller when a heating element <b>114</b>,<b>124</b> has reached a prescribed temperature, such that the controller may change the supply of power to elements within the aerosol generating device accordingly. Optionally, the controller comprises a PID (proportional integral derivative) controller, which uses a control loop feedback mechanism to control the temperature of the heating elements based on data supplied from one or more temperature sensors disposed in the device. In an embodiment, the controller comprises a PID controller configured to control the temperature of each heating element based on temperature data supplied from thermocouples disposed at each of the heating elements.</p>
<p id="p-0324" num="0321">The session of use <b>302</b> begins when the device is activated <b>304</b> and the controller controls the device to supply energy to at least the first induction heating unit <b>110</b>. The device may be activated by a user by, for example, actuating a push button, or inhaling from the device. Actuating means for use with an aerosol generating device are known to the person skilled in the art. In the context of a heater assembly comprising induction heating means, the session of use begins when the controller instructs a varying electrical current to be supplied to an inductor (such as first and second coils <b>112</b>,<b>122</b>) and thus a varying magnetic field to be supplied to the induction heating element, generating a rise in temperature of the induction heating element. As mentioned hereinabove, this may conveniently be referred to as &#x201c;supplying energy to the induction heating unit&#x201d;.</p>
<p id="p-0325" num="0322">The end <b>306</b> of the session of use session of use <b>302</b> occurs when the controller instructs elements in the device to stop supplying energy to all heating units present in the aerosol generating device. In the context of a heater assembly comprising induction heating units, the session of use ends when varying electrical current ceases to be supplied to any of the induction heating elements provided in the heating assembly, such that any varying magnetic field ceases to be supplied to the induction heating elements.</p>
<p id="p-0326" num="0323">At the beginning of the smoking session <b>302</b> the temperature of the first heating element rapidly increases until it reaches the maximum operating temperature <b>308</b>. The time taken <b>310</b> to reach the maximum operating temperature <b>308</b> may be referred to as the &#x201c;ramp-up&#x201d; period, and has a duration of less than 20 seconds according to various embodiments.</p>
<p id="p-0327" num="0324">The temperature of the first heating element may optionally drop from the maximum operating temperature <b>308</b> to a lower temperature <b>314</b> later in the session of use <b>312</b>.

In another embodiment, in the second mode of operation, the ratio of the second duration to the first duration may be from 2:1 to 12:1, from 2.5:1 to 11:1. In particular, the ratio may be from 3:1 to 4:1; alternatively, the ratio may be from 8:1 to 10:1. This embodiment may be particularly suitable for reducing the amount of condensate formed in the device during a session of use.</p>
<p id="p-0332" num="0329">The inventors have identified that operating the first heating element at its maximum operating temperature for a greater proportion of the session of use may help in reducing the amount of condensate which collects in the device during use. This effect may be particularly noticeable in so-called &#x201c;boost&#x201d; modes of operation where the heating unit operates at a higher maximum operating temperature during a shorter session of use.</p>

<heading id="h-0007" level="1">EXAMPLES</heading>
<p id="p-0379" num="0374">Six programmed heating profiles were assessed and are summarised in Table 3. The profiles were tested on an aerosol generating device according to an example wherein the heating assembly contained two heating units. The heating units were arranged such that the first heating unit was disposed closer to the mouth end of the heating assembly than the second heating unit. The assembly was configured such that the heating units had different programmed heating profiles; the heating profiles of the heating assembly were paired as the profiles are paired within the double lines shown in Table 3.</p>

<p id="p-0401" num="0391">The heating assembly <b>100</b> was programmed such that the first heating unit <b>110</b> should reach a maximum operating temperature T<b>1</b> of approximately 260&#xb0; C. as quickly as possible. The heating assembly <b>100</b> was programmed such that the first heating unit <b>110</b> would remain at a temperature T<b>1</b> of 260&#xb0; C. for the first 135 seconds of the session of use, then drop to a temperature T<b>7</b> of approximately 230&#xb0; C. for the rest of the session.</p>
<p id="p-0402" num="0392">The heating assembly <b>100</b> was programmed such that the second heating unit <b>120</b> was initially at ambient temperature T<b>2</b> for the first 25 seconds after the start of the session of use. The heating assembly <b>100</b> was programmed so that the second heating unit would then reach an operating temperature T<b>3</b> of 100&#xb0; C. at a time t<b>3</b> approximately 25 seconds after the start of the session of use. The heating assembly <b>100</b> was programmed such that the second heating unit <b>120</b> would subsequently rise to a heating temperature T<b>4</b> of 150&#xb0; C. at a time t<b>4</b> approximately 50 seconds after the start of the session of use. The heating assembly <b>100</b> was programmed such that the second heating unit <b>120</b> would subsequently rise to a heating temperature T<b>5</b> of 200&#xb0; C. at a time t<b>5</b> approximately 75 seconds after the start of the session of use. The heating assembly <b>100</b> was further programmed such that the second heating unit <b>120</b> would subsequently rise at time t<b>6</b> to a heating temperature T<b>1</b> of 260&#xb0; C. approximately 100 seconds after the start of the session of use. The temperature of the first and second heating units <b>110</b>,<b>120</b> are therefore optionally substantially the same (optionally 260&#xb0; C.) for a period of time which may be approximately 30 seconds.</p>
<p id="p-0403" num="0393">An important aspect of the embodiment is that at a time t<b>7</b> (optionally 130 seconds after start of the session of use) the heating assembly <b>100</b> may be programmed to increase the desired operating temperature of the second heating unit <b>120</b> to a temperature T<b>6</b> which is above the maximum operating temperature T<b>1</b> of the first heating unit <b>110</b>. For example, according to an embodiment the temperature T<b>6</b> of the second heating unit <b>120</b> may be set to 270&#xb0; C. which may be 10&#xb0; C. hotter than the maximum operating or heating temperature T<b>1</b> of the first heating unit <b>110</b> (260&#xb0; C.).</p>
<p id="p-0404" num="0394">Other embodiments are contemplated wherein the temperature T<b>6</b> of the second heating unit <b>120</b> may be 0-10&#xb0; C., 10-20&#xb0; C., 20-30&#xb0; C., 30-40&#xb0; C., 40-50&#xb0; C. or more than 50&#xb0; C. hotter than the maximum operating or heating temperature T<b>1</b> of the first heating unit <b>110</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0405" num="0395">According to the embodiment the heating assembly <b>100</b> may be arranged to maintain the temperature of the second heating unit <b>120</b> at the maximum operating temperature T<b>6</b> until the end of the session of use which may be 195 seconds after the start of the session of use.</p>
<p id="p-0406" num="0396">According to the embodiment, the heating assembly <b>100</b> may be arranged to drop the temperature of the first heating unit <b>110</b> to a lower operating temperature T<b>7</b> (optionally 230&#xb0; C.) at a time t<b>8</b> which may be 135 seconds after the start of the session of use. Once the temperature of the first heating unit <b>110</b> is reduced to the lower operating temperature of T<b>7</b> (optionally 230&#xb0; C.) the temperature may be maintained at that level until the end of the session of use which may be 195 seconds after the start of the session of use.</p>
<p id="p-0407" num="0397">It is unknown to provide a temperature profile for the first heating unit <b>110</b> and the second heating unit <b>120</b> wherein in the second half of the session <b>902</b> the (maximum) operating or heating temperature (270&#xb0; C.) of the second heating unit <b>120</b> exceeds the (maximum) operating or heating temperature (260&#xb0; C.) of the first heating unit <b>110</b>. According to an embodiment the maximum operating or heating temperature of the second heating unit <b>120</b> may be set to be 0-10&#xb0; C., 10-20&#xb0; C., 20-30&#xb0; C., 30-40&#xb0; C. or 40-50&#xb0; C. higher than the maximum operating or heating temperature of the first heating unit <b>110</b>. The inventors have identified that that this combined temperature profile is particularly effective at minimising the amount of undesirable condensation observed inside the device. The inventors have also identified that that this combined temperature profile is particularly effective in improving the flavour and associated taste experience of the user.</p>
<p id="p-0408" num="0398">The heating profile according to the embodiment shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>9</b></figref> is similar to the heating profile shown and described above with reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>7</b></figref>. However, whereas according to the embodiment shown and described with reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>7</b></figref> there are two profile steps (t<b>0</b>-t<b>3</b> and t<b>3</b>-t<b>4</b>) before the first heating unit <b>110</b> and the second heating until <b>120</b> reach substantially the same operating or heating temperature, according to the present embodiment as shown and described with reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>9</b></figref> there are more than two profile steps before the first heating unit <b>110</b> and the second heating until <b>120</b> reach substantially the same operating or heating temperature.</p>
<p id="p-0409" num="0399">According to an embodiment there may be three, four, five, six, seven, eight, nine, ten or more than ten profile steps before the first heating unit <b>110</b> and the second heating until <b>120</b> reach substantially the same operating or heating temperature.</p>
<p id="p-0410" num="0400">According to an embodiment as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>9</b></figref> there may be four profile steps (t<b>043</b>, t<b>3</b>-t<b>4</b>, t<b>4</b>-t<b>5</b>, t<b>5</b>-t<b>6</b>) before the first heating unit <b>110</b> and the second heating until <b>120</b> reach substantially the same operating or heating temperature.</p>
