<heading id="h-0002" level="1">FIELD</heading>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">The disclosure relates to a semirigid poultry and/or swine enclosure.</p>
<heading id="h-0003" level="1">BACKGROUND</heading>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">Conventional poultry and/or swine production uses stationary facilities. Due to their stationary nature, poultry and/or swine in conventional systems often live in dirty litter and/or fecal matter. As such, conventional poultry require vaccines, antibiotics and/or other drugs, and/or increased management practices to keep animals healthy. Stationary systems also require litter, bedding, and/or waste disposal/removal which leads to high materials costs, elevated labor costs, and environmental concerns. Furthermore, poultry and/or swine that are treated with vaccines, drugs, and antibiotics, and may subsequently lead to negative health effects on humans that consume their meat and eggs.</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">Existing methods of pasture raising poultry and/or swine are expensive for both farmers and consumers and thus are typically limited to small scale production. The amount of land and labor required to manage a large quantity of grazing poultry and/or swine has typically prevented pasture raised poultry and/or swine from being scalable for commercial poultry and/or swine farmers.</p>
<heading id="h-0004" level="1">SUMMARY</heading>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">One aspect of the disclosure relates to a semirigid poultry and/or swine enclosure. The semirigid poultry and/or swine enclosure may be moved and/or may move across a field to provide access to fresh pasture and bedding daily, eliminating the need for litter disposal, bedding, and vaccines, drugs, or antibiotics and allowing them to graze on pasture, grass, insects, worms, seeds, weeds, and flowers. As the semirigid poultry and/or swine enclosure moves across a field with an undulating landscape, it may flex and/or adjust to accommodate the terrain and prevent the escape of the poultry and/or swine.</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">One aspect of the semirigid poultry and/or swine enclosure may include a semirigid foundation. The semirigid foundation may comprise one or more flexible joints between rigid structural elements. The flexible joints may allow movement between the rigid structural elements. As such, the foundation may be semirigid and semiflexible. As the poultry and/or swine enclosure moves over uneven terrain, the flexible joints may enable portions of the semirigid foundation to flex while the rigid structural elements provide a solid foundation for a poultry and/or swine enclosure. The flexible joints may be links and/or linkages that enable flexion between the one or more rigid structural elements.</p>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">One aspect of the semirigid poultry and/or swine enclosure may include a semirigid frame. The semirigid frame may comprise one or more flexible joints between rigid structural elements. The flexible joints may allow movement between the rigid structural elements. As such, the frame of the poultry and/or swine enclosure may be semirigid and semiflexible. As the poultry and/or swine enclosure moves over uneven terrain, the flexible joints enable portions of the semirigid frame to flex while the rigid structural elements provide a solid frame for a poultry and/or swine enclosure.</p>
<p id="p-0009" num="0008">The rigid structural elements of the semirigid foundation and/or semirigid frame may comprise piping (e.g., steel piping), framing (e.g., metal framing components), beams, wood beams, rubber, fiberglass, plastic, steel, aluminum, epoxy, composite materials, and/or other materials. A semirigid frame and/or foundation may be made of multiple rigid structural elements. Some or all of the rigid structural elements may be coupled together via flexible joints.</p>
<p id="p-0010" num="0009">The flexible joints may include one or more of a pivot point joint, a universal joint (&#x201c;U-joint&#x201d;), a hinge joint, a prismatic joint, a ball joint, a revolute joint, a hooke joint, and/or any other joint that would facilitate movement between the rigid structural elements. The flexible joints may facilitate horizontal, vertical, lateral, and/or any other directional movement. In some implementations, the flexible joints may comprise a flexible material such that the rigid structural elements are coupled together via a flexible material.</p>
<p id="p-0011" num="0010">In some implementations, the semirigid foundation may include a chassis such that the poultry and/or swine enclosure is mobile. The chassis may include rigid structural elements and/or flexible joints. The rigid structural element(s) of the chassis may include a drive shaft. The drive shaft may have one or more flexible joints.</p>
<p id="p-0012" num="0011">In some implementations, the poultry and/or swine enclosure may comprise multiple wall barriers. The wall barriers may at least partially form the enclosure and/or contain the poultry and/or swine within the enclosure. The wall barriers may be coupled to the semirigid foundation and/or frame. In some implementations, the wall barriers may be resiliently flexible. By way of non-limiting example, the wall barriers may be made of one or more of and/or a combination of fences, walls, netting, wood, paneling, mesh, wire, cloth, metal sheeting, shingles, tarpaper, windows, canvas, plastic, tarp, rubber, and/or other materials. In some implementations, one or more wall barriers (e.g., outer walls) may consist of chicken wire or a comparable predator-deterring barrier that doesn't prevent fresh air and sunlight from entering. In some implementations, for example, one or more portions of the wall barriers may include canvas, plastic, panels, windows, louvers, and/or another material that rolls up/down for temperature regulation (the deployment of which may automated, including thermostatic regulation). In some implementations, one or more wall barriers may have multiple layers with one or more (e.g., multiple) slits along its length in order to conform to the contours of the field and/or close any gaps through which the animals could escape.</p>
<p id="p-0013" num="0012">In some implementations, the wall barriers may be rigid. The rigid wall barriers may be coupled together via flexible wall connectors. The flexible wall connectors may connect the rigid wall barriers and allow some flexibility between barriers. By way of non-limiting example, the flexible wall connectors may comprise a flexible material disposed between two or more rigid wall barriers, a sliding channel or groove that enables the rigid wall barriers to slide such that one wall barrier may slide up/down to accommodate a dip in the field while the other wall barrier remains at the same height or slides up/down to a different level), one or more hinges disposed between two or more rigid wall barriers, suspension systems such as a leaf spring, strut and piston, hydraulic systems, and/or other flexible wall connectors.</p>
<p id="p-0014" num="0013">In some implementations, the walls may move naturally as the poultry coop moves over the field. In some implementations, the walls may be automated and/or manual (e.g., via electrical, gas powered, solar, air pressure, water pressure and/or other means).</p>
<p id="p-0015" num="0014">The poultry and/or swine enclosure may be floorless. As such, the poultry and/or swine contained in the enclosure may be able to graze on a portion of the field. In some implementations, the enclosure may include a chassis with wheels, tracks, skids, and/or rail that facilitates movement of the enclosure. By way of example, there may be a clearance between one or more wall barriers and the field such that at least a portion of the enclosure may pass over deceased poultry and/or swine lying in the field. In some implementations, a lower portion of at least one of the wall barriers may be resiliently flexible. In some implementations, one or more sides of the barriers may be resiliently flexible.</p>
<p id="p-0016" num="0015">In some implementations, a semirigid poultry enclosure may comprise an automated movement system for the semirigid poultry enclosure. The automated movement system may be configured to move and/or initiate movement for a semirigid poultry enclosure that is at least 100 feet in length. The automated movement system may comprise multiple sensors. In some implementations, the sensors may include GPS sensors and/or other sensors, including but not limited to optical distance sensors and/or encoders. Individual ones of the multiple sensors may be coupled to individual ones of the multiple wheels (wherein the wheels are not limited to wheels and may comprise one or more drive units, tracks, and/or other traction enabling devices). The multiple sensors may be configured to generate sensor information characterizing a location and/or a position of the semirigid poultry enclosure. The automated movement system may comprise one or more processors configured by machine readable instructions.</p>
<p id="p-0017" num="0016">In some implementations, the automated movement system may include one or more of: one or more servers, one or more sensors, one or more client computing platforms, and/or other components. The one or more sensors may provide sensor information to the one or more servers and/or client computing platforms. The one or more servers may be configured to communicate with one or more client computing platforms according to a client/server architecture and/or other architecture. The one or more servers and/or client computing platforms may include one or more physical processors configured to execute one or more computer program components. The computer program components may include one or more of a sensor information component, a location determination component, a movement determination component, a movement initiation component, and/or other components.</p>
<p id="p-0018" num="0017">The sensor information component may be configured to obtain the sensor information. The sensor information may be obtained from one or more sensors coupled to the semirigid poultry enclosure. In some implementations, the sensor information may characterize a location and/or position of the semirigid poultry enclosure, a condition of the field, and/or other characteristics of the semirigid poultry enclosure, the poultry, and/or the field. In some implementations, the sensor information may include information characterizing a condition of the field on which the semirigid poultry enclosure is moving/will move, one or more aspects of the weather outside the semirigid poultry enclosure, a temperature and/or humidity level inside the semirigid poultry enclosure, poultry activity within the semirigid poultry enclosure, poultry mortality within the semirigid poultry enclosure, an obstacle in the path of and/or near the semirigid poultry enclosure, and/or other information.</p>
<p id="p-0019" num="0018">The location determination component may be configured to determine the location and/or position of the semirigid poultry enclosure. The location and/or position of the semirigid poultry enclosure may include a specific location and/or position of the semirigid poultry enclosure within the field, GPS coordinates of the semirigid poultry enclosure, a mapping of the position of the semirigid poultry enclosure, and/or other information. The location determination component may be configured to determine the location and/or the position of the semirigid poultry enclosure based on the sensor information.</p>
<p id="p-0020" num="0019">The field condition determination component may be configured to determine the condition of the field. The condition of the field may include whether the field is wet, muddy, icy, covered in snow, dry, and/or another field condition. The condition of the field may include a manure level and/or amount of manure on the field. In some implementations, the condition of the field may be determined based on the soil. The field condition determination component may determine the condition of the field based on the sensor information.</p>
<p id="p-0021" num="0020">The movement determination component may be configured to determine an automated movement based on the sensor information. The movement initiation component may be configured to initiate automated movement of the semirigid poultry enclosure based on the sensor information, the location and/or position of the semirigid poultry enclosure, a determination of the automated movement to be made based on the sensor information, and/or other information. In some implementations, determining an automated movement based on the sensor information may include determining movement of one or more of the multiple wheels based on the location and/or position of the semirigid poultry enclosure in addition to one or more of a condition of the field, weather, a temperature of the semirigid poultry enclosure, poultry activity, poultry mortality, an obstacle and/or other sensor information. In some implementations, the movement determination component may be configured to determine an automated movement of one or more wheels of the semirigid poultry enclosure and/or the semirigid poultry enclosure via machine learning.</p>
<p id="p-0022" num="0021">In some implementations, as previously set forth herein, the joints of the semirigid foundation may include one or more flexible portions disposed between two or more rigid structural elements. In some implementations, the flexible portions of the semirigid poultry enclosure may comprise a material that is more flexible than the rigid structural elements such that the rigid structural elements are connected via the flexible portions that facilitate flexion of the semirigid poultry enclosure during movement over undulating terrain.</p>
<p id="p-0023" num="0022">In some implementations, the individual ones of the multiple wheels of the semirigid poultry enclosure are independently movable and/or controllable. In some implementations, automated movement of the semirigid poultry enclosure may include initiating movement of one or more of the individual ones of the multiple wheels.</p>
<p id="p-0024" num="0023">These and other objects, features, and characteristics of the disclosed herein, as well as the methods of operation and functions of the related elements of structure and the combination of parts and economies of manufacture, will become more apparent upon consideration of the following description and the appended claims with reference to the accompanying drawings, all of which form a part of this specification, wherein like reference numerals designate corresponding parts in the various figures.

<p id="p-0032" num="0031"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref> illustrates a semirigid poultry and/or swine enclosure, in accordance with one or more implementations. Semirigid poultry and/or swine enclosure <b>100</b> may be moved and/or may move across a field <b>101</b>. As semirigid poultry and/or swine enclosure <b>100</b> moves across a field with an undulating landscape, it may flex and/or adjust to accommodate the terrain and prevent the escape of the poultry and/or swine.</p>
<p id="p-0033" num="0032">Semirigid poultry and/or swine enclosure <b>100</b> may include a semirigid foundation <b>102</b>. Semirigid foundation <b>102</b> may comprise one or more flexible joints <b>104</b> disposed between and/or connecting rigid structural elements <b>106</b>. Flexible joints <b>104</b> may allow movement between rigid structural elements <b>106</b>. As such, semirigid foundation <b>102</b> may accommodate undulating terrain without allowing poultry and/or swine inside poultry and/or swine enclosure <b>102</b> to escape.</p>
<p id="p-0034" num="0033">In some implementations, semirigid poultry and/or swine enclosure <b>100</b> may include a semirigid frame <b>108</b>. Semirigid frame <b>108</b> may be coupled to and/or built upon semirigid foundation <b>102</b>. Semirigid frame <b>108</b> may comprise one or more flexible joints <b>104</b> between rigid structural elements <b>106</b>. In some implementations, flexible joints <b>104</b> included in semirigid foundation <b>102</b> may be the same and/or different as flexible joints <b>104</b> included in semirigid frame <b>108</b>. Rigid structural elements <b>106</b> included in semirigid foundation <b>102</b> may be the same and/or different as rigid structural elements <b>106</b> included in semirigid frame. Semirigid frame <b>106</b> may be made from the same material as semirigid foundation <b>102</b>. In some implementations semirigid frame <b>106</b> may be made from a different material than semirigid foundation <b>102</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0035" num="0034">Flexible joints <b>104</b> may allow movement between rigid structural elements <b>104</b> in the semirigid foundation <b>102</b> and/or the semirigid frame <b>108</b>. As such, the frame of the poultry and/or swine enclosure may be semirigid and/or semiflexible. Poultry and/or swine enclosure <b>100</b> moves over uneven terrain, flexible joints <b>104</b> enable portions of the semirigid frame <b>108</b> to flex while the rigid structural elements <b>104</b> provide a solid frame for poultry and/or swine enclosure <b>100</b>. (It is worth noting that not every single flexible joint <b>104</b>, rigid structural element <b>106</b>, portion of semirigid structural frame <b>108</b>, portion of semirigid foundation <b>102</b>, wheel <b>110</b>, etc. depicted in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref> include a reference numeral. Also, while all flexible joints <b>104</b>, rigid structural elements <b>106</b>, semirigid structural frame <b>108</b>, and semirigid foundation <b>102</b>, wheels <b>110</b>, etc. are depicted in the same manner in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>, they may not all be the same and/or they may be different.)</p>
<p id="p-0036" num="0035">Rigid structural elements <b>106</b> may be made of piping (e.g., steel piping), framing (e.g., metal framing components), beams, wood beams, rubber, fiberglass, plastic, steel, aluminum, epoxy, composite materials, and/or other materials. Semirigid frame <b>108</b> and/or semirigid foundation <b>102</b> may be made of multiple rigid structural elements <b>106</b>. In some implementations, only some of the rigid structural elements <b>106</b> may be coupled together via flexible joints <b>104</b> (as illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>). In some implementations all of the rigid structural elements <b>106</b> may be coupled together via one or more types of flexible joints <b>104</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0037" num="0036"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref> illustrates some example flexible joints, in accordance with one or more implementations. The flexible joints may include one or more of a pivot point joint <b>202</b>, a universal joint (&#x201c;U-joint&#x201d;) <b>204</b>, a hinge joint, a prismatic joint, a ball joint, a revolute joint, a hooke joint, and/or any other joint that would facilitate movement between the rigid structural elements. The flexible joints may facilitate horizontal, vertical, lateral, and/or any other directional movement. In some implementations, the flexible joints may comprise a flexible material <b>206</b> such that the rigid structural elements are coupled together via a flexible material.</p>
<p id="p-0038" num="0037"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref> illustrates an example semirigid foundation, in accordance with one or more implementations. Semirigid foundation <b>300</b> may include a chassis with one or more wheels <b>302</b> and/or a drive shaft <b>304</b>. Wheels <b>302</b> and drive shaft <b>304</b> may enable poultry and/or swine enclosure to be mobile. The chassis may include rigid structural elements <b>306</b> and/or flexible joints <b>308</b> (the same as or similar to those in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>). In some implementations, the drive shaft <b>304</b> may have one or more flexible joints <b>308</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0039" num="0038"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b></figref> illustrates a drive caster, in accordance with one or more implementations.

By way of non-limiting example, drive casters <b>402</b> may comprise an independently motorized wheel apparatus.</p>
<p id="p-0040" num="0039">Returning to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>, poultry and/or swine enclosure <b>100</b> may comprise multiple wall barriers <b>112</b> and/or roof barriers <b>114</b>. Wall barriers <b>112</b> and/or roof barriers <b>114</b> may at least partially form the enclosure and/or contain the poultry and/or swine within the enclosure. Wall barriers <b>112</b> and/or roof barriers <b>114</b> may be coupled to semirigid foundation <b>102</b> and/or semirigid frame <b>108</b>. In some implementations, wall barriers <b>112</b> and/or roof barriers <b>114</b> may be resiliently flexible. By way of non-limiting example, wall barriers <b>112</b> and/or roof barriers <b>114</b> may be made of one or more of and/or a combination of fences, walls, netting, wood, paneling, mesh, wire, cloth, metal sheeting, shingles, tarpaper, windows, canvas, plastic, tarp, rubber, and/or other materials. In some implementations, one or more wall barriers <b>112</b> (e.g., outer walls) may consist of chicken wire or a comparable predator-deterring barrier that doesn't prevent fresh air and sunlight from entering. In some implementations, for example, one or more portions of wall barriers <b>112</b> may include canvas, plastic, and/or another material that rolls up/down for temperature regulation (the deployment of which may automated, including thermostatic regulation). In some implementations, the one or more wall barriers <b>112</b> may have multiple layers with one or more (e.g., multiple) slits along its length in order to conform to the contours of the field and/or close any gaps through which the animals could escape.</p>
<p id="p-0041" num="0040">In some implementations, wall barriers <b>112</b> and/or roof barriers <b>114</b> may be rigid. The rigid wall barriers <b>112</b> and/or roof barriers <b>114</b> may be coupled together via flexible wall connectors <b>105</b>. Flexible wall connectors <b>105</b> may connect rigid wall barriers <b>112</b> and allow some flexibility between wall barriers <b>112</b>. By way of non-limiting example, the flexible wall connectors <b>105</b> may comprise a flexible material disposed between two or more rigid wall barriers <b>112</b>, a sliding channel or groove that enables the rigid wall barriers <b>112</b> to slide such that one wall barrier may slide up/down to accommodate a dip in the field while the other wall barrier remains at the same height or slides up/down to a different level), one or more hinges disposed between two or more rigid wall barriers <b>112</b>, and/or other flexible wall connectors. (In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>, the flexible wall connectors <b>105</b> may appear to be located at individual points between wall barriers <b>112</b>, however, it is contemplated that such flexible wall connectors run the entire junction between wall barriers <b>112</b> and/or a portion of the junction between wall barriers <b>112</b>).</p>
<p id="p-0042" num="0041">In some implementations, the semirigid poultry enclosure may comprise an automated movement system for the semirigid poultry enclosure. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b></figref> illustrates automated movement system <b>500</b>, in accordance with one or more implementations. Automated movement system <b>500</b> may be configured to move and/or initiate movement for a semirigid poultry enclosure that is at least <b>90</b> feet in length. As set forth herein, the semirigid poultry enclosure may include one or more of a semirigid foundation, a semirigid frame, one or more wall barriers, a roof barrier, and/or other components. Such elements may enable the semirigid poultry enclosure, with its large size of at least <b>100</b> feet in length, to move over undulating terrain in an automated manner. In some implementations, moving such a large poultry enclosure may require planned and/or coordinated movements and a semirigid foundation that can accommodate the undulating terrain during such movement. Without a semirigid foundation and/or coordinated location and/or positioned based movement, moving such a large poultry enclosure may lead to structural issues in the poultry enclosure, movement issues (e.g., getting stuck), and/or power requirement issues. Additionally, a semirigid foundation with coordinated location and/or positioned based movement enables pre-planned movements, warnings of potential hazards or problems, remote control of the housing unit, and/or other advantages typically unavailable for such large poultry enclosures and/or large scale pasture raised poultry operations.</p>

<p id="p-0049" num="0048">In some implementations, the movement, starting point, and/or ending point of the semirigid poultry enclosure may be predetermined such that location determination component <b>510</b> may be configured to determine where along the predetermined path and/or route the semirigid poultry enclosure is.</p>
<p id="p-0050" num="0049">Field condition determination component <b>512</b> may be configured to determine the condition of the field. Specifically, field condition determination component <b>512</b> may be configured to determine one or more characteristics of the field condition(s). For example, field condition determination component <b>512</b> may be configured to determine whether the field is wet and/or how wet it is, whether the field is muddy and/or how much mud is present, whether the field is icy, whether the field is covered in snow and/or how much snow, whether the field is dry and/or needs water, and/or another field condition. In some implementations, field condition determination component <b>512</b> may be configured to determine a manure level of the field (e.g., how much manure is on the field within the semirigid poultry enclosure). In some implementations, the condition of the field may be determined based on the soil. One or more sensors may be configured to obtain soil information such that field condition determination component <b>512</b> may determine the condition of the field based on condition of the soil. One or more of field conditions and/or characterizations of the field conditions may be determined based on the sensor information.</p>
<p id="p-0051" num="0050">Movement determination component <b>514</b> may be configured to determine an automated movement based on the sensor information. The movement(s) of the semirigid poultry enclosure may be coordinated to allow pastured poultry fresh forage access (along with even manure deposition) while maximizing useful pasture area. Movement determination component <b>514</b> may determine coordinated movements that account for and/or the shape of the field (e.g., pasture shape), any terrain limitations, ambient weather, poultry condition, efficient placement/harvesting locations, and/or other aspects of flock management. Movement determination component may be configured to determine automated movement(s) that assist in managing semirigid poultry enclosure movements including planning movements, determining desired starting and/or finishing locations using delineated enclosure movements, making real time decisions based on one or more of the position and/or location of the semirigid poultry enclosure, the field conditions, the weather, poultry health and/or mortality, one or more obstacles, and/or other routinely monitored parameters.</p>
<p id="p-0052" num="0051">Movement initiation component <b>516</b> may be configured to initiate automated movement of the semirigid poultry enclosure based on the sensor information, the location and/or position of the semirigid poultry enclosure, a determination of the automated movement to be made based on the sensor information, and/or other information. In some implementations, determining an automated movement based on the sensor information may include determining movement of one or more of the multiple wheels based on the location and/or position of the semirigid poultry enclosure in addition to one or more of a condition of the field, weather, a temperature of the semirigid poultry enclosure, poultry activity, poultry mortality, an obstacle and/or other sensor information.</p>
<p id="p-0053" num="0052">In some implementations, the individual ones of the multiple wheels of the semirigid poultry enclosure are independently movable and/or controllable. In some implementations, automated movement of the semirigid poultry enclosure may include initiating movement of one or more of the individual ones of the multiple wheels.</p>
<p id="p-0054" num="0053">In some implementations, movement determination component <b>514</b> may be configured to determine an automated movement of one or more wheels of the semirigid poultry enclosure and/or the semirigid poultry enclosure via artificial intelligence. Artificial intelligence may simulate human intelligence with computer circuits and software. There are multiple approaches to machine intelligence (e.g., machine learning, expert systems, neural networks, fuzzy logic systems, and/or other types of machine learning and/or artificial intelligence). Machine learning enables systems to learn and improve from experience without being explicitly programmed. Machine learning builds and uses algorithms that receive input data and use statistical analysis to make output predictions. The output may be updated as new data is available. Machine learning may include supervised learning, unsupervised learning, semi-supervised learning, reinforcement learning, and/or other types of machine learning. In some implementations, machine-learning may include neural networks.</p>
<p id="p-0055" num="0054">Neural networks may comprise computer simulations of neuro-physiological structures (e.g., nerve cells). Artificial neural networks learn by examples, association, or experience, rather than being programmed with task-specific rules. Neural networks may generalize, make inferences, and/or make predictions about data that they have not yet been exposed to.</p>
<p id="p-0056" num="0055">Expert systems may use rule-based algorithms to capture knowledge of human experts by obtaining information and making a series of decisions based on facts and logical branching. These systems involve human experts for constructing and/or training the decision models. Fuzzy logic systems use a &#x201c;degrees of truth&#x201d; approach that allows computers to represent words and concepts such as vagueness, uncertainty, and degrees of an attribute. Fuzzy logic systems enable computers to represent complex relationships and interactions between such concepts. They can also be a useful tool for describing human attributes in terms that a computer can process. Neuro-fuzzy technology is a hybrid artificial intelligence technique employing the capabilities of both neural network learning and fuzzy logic model specification.</p>
