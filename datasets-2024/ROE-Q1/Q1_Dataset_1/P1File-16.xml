<heading level="1" id="h-0001">FIELD OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0002" num="0001">This invention relates to a cooking apparatus and, in particular, to an automated cooker for preparing food comprising a plurality of ingredients.</p>
<heading level="1" id="h-0002">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">Labour saving devices for assisting in the preparation of food are common to both home and professional kitchens. Devices such as food processors and blenders are used to prepare ingredients prior to cooking. However, the cooking process itself is conventionally undertaken manually during which the food being prepared is constantly monitored in order, for example, to check food temperature and avoid overcooking. In addition, different ingredients require different cooking times and therefore must be periodically added at different stages of the cooking process, again requiring constant monitoring and input from the chef. This requires a significant time investment and can therefore deter those who are time pressed from preparing home cooked meals. In the professional kitchen environment, constant supervision of dishes increases labour requirements and therefore increases costs.</p>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">Cooking devices have been developed to automate the process of adding ingredients to a dish during cooking and to control the cooking process.</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">US4,649,810 and US5,819.636 both disclose automated cookers which comprise a rotating carousel having multiple compartments for containing various ingredients. The carousel is mounted over a cooking vessel and has a fixed opening in its base positioned over a corresponding opening in the cooking vessel. Rotation of the carousel moves the various compartments over the opening causing the ingredients therein to deposit into the cooking vessel, the carousel being controlled to deposit the ingredients at pre-determined intervals during the cooking process. Such cooking devices require rotational drive mechanisms which increase the complexity, weight, size and cost of the device. Furthermore, the order in which the ingredients are delivered is limited by the direction of rotation of the carousel and the order in which the compartments are preloaded, and as a result the cooking programme may not be varied once initiated.</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">DE3346016 and US4,503,502 disclose cooking devices having a plurality of ingredient storage containers connected to a cooking chamber and arranged to selectively dispense ingredients into the cooking chamber. Each storage chamber has a closure member selectively movable between an open position in which the container is open to the cooking chamber and a closed position in which the container is sealed from the cooking chamber.</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">EP2429352 discloses a cooking vessel having a cooking chamber and a plurality of ingredient storage containers arranged to selectively dispense ingredients into the cooking chamber. Each storage container has a closure member selectively movable by an actuator between an open position in which the container is open to the cooking chamber and a closed position in which the container is sealed from the cooking chamber. The actuator comprises a plurality of push rods each being movable between a retracted position in which the closure member is closed and an extended position in which the closure member is open. Each closure member has a valve, the movement of the corresponding push rod to the extended position causing the valve to open creating a fluid pathway between the cooking chamber and the storage container for the ingress of gas into the storage chamber.</p>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">WO2016182975 discloses an automated cooking device which has a dispensing selector and a set of ingredient dispenser units each comprising an ingredient container and a dispensing gate having a hinged door. The dispensing gate includes a coupling mechanism for engagement with part of the dispensing selector. A control unit partially controls the dispensing selector.</p>
<p id="p-0009" num="0008">Automated cooking devices such as those discussed above, do not provide effective arrangements for efficiently transferring the food ingredients from the storage containers to the cooking chamber.</p>
<heading level="1" id="h-0003">Statements of the Invention</heading>
<p id="p-0010" num="0009">According to the present invention, there is provided a cooking vessel having a cooking chamber and a plurality of ingredient storage containers arranged to selectively dispense ingredients into the cooking chamber, each storage container having a closure member selectively movable between an open position in which the container is open to the cooking chamber and a closed position in which the container is sealed from the cooking chamber, each storage container having a rigid outer wall and containing a flexible inner liner, means for feeding a fluid to a position between the outer wall and the liner when the closure member is in its open position in order to eject the liner from the container and cause any ingredients located therein to pass from the storage container to the cooking chamber.</p>
<p id="p-0011" num="0010">Preferably, the cooking vessel comprises an enclosed chamber that enables cooking in a pressurised environment or under atmospheric pressure. The cooking vessel also controls temperature at a required level as is practised in, for instance, SOUS VIDE cooking. Preferably, the fluid is a gas under pressure, more preferably air under pressure.</p>
<p id="p-0012" num="0011">Preferably, the flexible inner liners of the storage containers are of a soft silicone material.</p>
<p id="p-0013" num="0012">Preferably, the cooking chamber and the storage containers are located within a common housing.</p>
<p id="p-0014" num="0013">Preferably, the housing is provided with a hinged lid allowing access to a platform located above the cooking chamber, the platform being provided with mounting means for accommodating the storage containers.</p>

<heading level="1" id="h-0005">DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0038" num="0037">The invention will now be described, by way of example only, with reference to the accompanying drawings.</p>
<p id="p-0039" num="0038">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>1</b> to <b>3</b></figref> of the accompanying drawings, cooking apparatus <b>1</b> of the invention comprises an enclosed chamber that enables cooking in a pressurised environment or under atmospheric pressure. The cooking vessel also controls temperature at a required level as is practised in, for instance, SOUS VIDE cooking. The apparatus is generally oblong in plan and having a depth dimension which is between those of its length and breadth. Apparatus <b>1</b> is provided with an upper section or lid <b>3</b> which is hingedly attached to the body <b>5</b> of apparatus <b>1</b> by a hinge arrangement <b>6</b> located at one narrow end of the apparatus <b>1</b>. As best seen in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b></figref>, hinge arrangement <b>6</b> is located inwardly of the end of the apparatus <b>1</b>. Upper section <b>3</b> is extended beyond hinge arrangement <b>6</b> by wing <b>6</b><i>a</i> and the end of body <b>5</b> is shaped to provide an inclined portion <b>6</b><i>b</i> which, when upper section <b>3</b> is in its raised position, lies closely adjacent wing <b>6</b><i>a</i>. Inclined portion <b>6</b><i>b</i> and wing <b>6</b><i>a</i> are provided with magnetic elements so that the upper section <b>3</b> is maintained in position once opened.</p>
<p id="p-0040" num="0039">At its opposite end, the upper section <b>3</b> and the body <b>5</b> are provided with engageable elements of a bayonet fastening including bayonet collar <b>8</b>. With the upper section <b>3</b> closed, as in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>, it may be locked to the body <b>5</b> by sliding the bayonet collar <b>8</b> to the right, as viewed from the front. Unlocking is achieved by sliding the bayonet collar <b>8</b> to the left.</p>
<p id="p-0041" num="0040">Upper section <b>3</b> comprises a base <b>7</b> in which are mounted four ingredient pods <b>9</b> and a condensing pot <b>11</b> which will be described in detail below. Surrounding the pods <b>9</b> and pot <b>11</b> is a transparent cover <b>13</b> which comprises a sidewall <b>15</b> and a generally flat top <b>17</b> integral therewith. Above pot <b>11</b> the top <b>17</b> has an opening with a dished margin <b>19</b>, the opening accommodating a condensing plate <b>21</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0042" num="0041">Mounted in upper section <b>3</b> of apparatus <b>1</b> so as to extend downwardly therefrom is a stirrer <b>23</b> having a flat beater <b>25</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0043" num="0042">As best seen in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b>A</figref>, body <b>5</b> of apparatus <b>1</b> accommodates a cooking bowl <b>101</b> which occupies a considerable proportion of the interior of body <b>5</b> below the locations of ingredient pods <b>9</b>. Bowl <b>101</b> is mounted above an electric heater <b>103</b> and below a condensing pot <b>105</b> which is arranged to collect condensed water, arising from the cooking process. Above condensing pot <b>105</b> is situated a condensing plate <b>107</b> through which exhaust steam passes. A steam exhaust <b>109</b> to the surrounding atmosphere connects to a steam solenoid to output exhausted steam.</p>
<p id="p-0044" num="0043">Also located within the body <b>5</b> of apparatus <b>1</b> is an air manifold <b>111</b> which is a six way manifold connecting an air motor, the exhaust and the ingredient pods as an integrated pneumatic system.</p>
<p id="p-0045" num="0044">The condensation mechanism is shown in more detail in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b>B</figref>. When the cooking bowl <b>101</b> is depressurised after a cooking operation, a valve at <b>113</b> is opened allowing steam to escape. The steam leaves through a vent in the lid of the cooking bowl <b>101</b> and enters the central channel <b>115</b> of the condensing pot <b>105</b>. The exhausted steam hits the condensing plate <b>107</b>. Some of the steam cools and condenses and is collected in the condensing pot <b>105</b>. The remainder of the steam is dispersed into the surrounding atmosphere.</p>

The top <b>53</b> of cup <b>51</b> is provided with a central upwardly extending air inlet <b>55</b>. At its lower end or mouth <b>56</b>, cup <b>51</b> is provided with a lid <b>57</b> which is hingedly attached to the cup <b>51</b> so that it can move from the position shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>6</b> and <b>8</b></figref> to that shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>7</b></figref>. In its closed position, lid <b>57</b> makes sealing engagement with the bottom of cup <b>51</b>. Accommodated within cup <b>51</b> is a soft silicone pod or liner <b>59</b> which lines the entire inner surface of cup <b>51</b> and is secured to cup <b>51</b> at its mouth <b>56</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0049" num="0048">Inlet <b>55</b> is connected to a motor driven air supply which, when operated, acts to feed air under pressure to the space between liner <b>59</b> and cup <b>51</b>, thereby causing the liner <b>59</b> to invert, that is to say, to be expelled from within cup <b>51</b>, with lid <b>57</b> being forced open in the process. Any ingredients within liner <b>59</b> are accordingly expelled from the cup <b>51</b> along with the liner although the latter remains attached to cup <b>51</b> at the mouth <b>56</b> thereof.</p>
<p id="p-0050" num="0049">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>9</b></figref> of the accompanying drawings, the base <b>121</b> of the apparatus <b>1</b> is provided with a power port <b>123</b> by which the apparatus may be connected to an electric supply. Mounted close to power port <b>123</b> are two steam solenoid valves, one of which controls water flow into the cooking bowl <b>101</b> and the other of which controls the release of steam from cooking bowl <b>101</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0051" num="0050">Adjacent solenoid valves <b>125</b>, there is located a water motor <b>127</b> which functions to pump water from the water tank <b>29</b> to the cooking bowl <b>101</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0052" num="0051">Water valve <b>129</b>, situated below water tank <b>29</b>, is arranged to create a seal between the water tank <b>29</b> and the interior of the apparatus <b>1</b> when the tank is in place.</p>
<p id="p-0053" num="0052">An air motor <b>131</b> operates to pump air into the pneumatic system to control the inversion of the pods <b>9</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0054" num="0053">Also mounted on base <b>121</b> are five air solenoid valves <b>131</b> which act to control air flow from the air motor <b>133</b> to each pod <b>9</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0055" num="0054">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>10</b> and <b>11</b></figref> of the accompanying drawings, the base <b>7</b> of upper section <b>3</b> of the apparatus <b>1</b> has mounted thereon a pressure/temperature sensor <b>135</b>. Sensor <b>135</b> measures pressure and temperature inside the cooking bowl <b>101</b> and inputs readings into the software to determine when to release the pressure solenoid valve <b>125</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0056" num="0055">Port <b>137</b> is a water inlet for water flowing from the water pump <b>127</b> into the cooking bowl <b>101</b>. Port <b>139</b> is an outlet for steam to pass from the cooking bowl <b>101</b> to steam solenoid <b>125</b> to be exhausted to atmosphere when a pressure change is required, either when the system is to be depressurised or the pressure is to be regulated.</p>
<p id="p-0057" num="0056">A safety valve <b>141</b> is a mechanical element which operates to release pressure when it exceeds a predetermined limit. A further safety valve <b>143</b> is also a mechanical element which is movable between two vertical positions. When the cooking bowl <b>101</b> is unpressurised, it sits in its lower position, allowing the collar <b>8</b> to be rotated to unlock the lid <b>3</b>. When the bowl is pressurised, it rises and blocks the collar from rotating. The user is thereby prevented from opening the lid <b>3</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0058" num="0057">Also mounted on base <b>7</b> is a wiper motor <b>145</b> which controls the rotation of the stirrer <b>23</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0059" num="0058">In order to effect a cooking operation using the above-described apparatus, food ingredients are loaded into the ingredient pods <b>9</b>. The hinged lid <b>3</b> is then lifted up to allow the user to insert the ingredient pods into the apparatus <b>1</b>. At a predetermined time in the cooking process, air is applied to the outside of the appropriate pod <b>9</b> causing it to invert and eject its contents into the main cooking bowl <b>101</b>. Water is fed from the removable water tank <b>29</b> into the cooking pot bowl <b>101</b> as required. A mechanism surrounding the steam exhaust point prevents hot steam from directly contacting the user and the perforated condensation plate <b>107</b> blocks the path of the steam allowing it to disperse while any condensates is collected in the removable cup <b>105</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0060" num="0059">The interrelationship of the components of various aspects of the apparatus <b>1</b> are shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>12</b>A</figref> (the air system), <b>12</b>B (the water system) and <b>12</b>C (the steam system).</p>
