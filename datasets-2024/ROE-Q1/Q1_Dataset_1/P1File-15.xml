<heading id="h-0002" level="1">BACKGROUND</heading>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">The present invention relates to refrigerated merchandisers, and more particularly to refrigerated merchandisers including open commercial refrigerated merchandisers.</p>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">Refrigerated merchandisers are typically used in retail food store settings such as grocery stores and convenience stores where fresh food product is displayed in a refrigerated environment. In general, refrigerated merchandisers include a case defining a product display area for supporting and displaying food products to be visible and accessible through an access opening in the case. Some merchandisers include doors to enclose the product display area and other refrigerated merchandisers are open to the ambient environment. Open refrigerated merchandisers utilize one or more air curtains that flow over the access opening to form a barrier between the refrigerated product display area and the ambient environment.</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">Refrigerated merchandisers also typically include one or more shelves that are used to support and display the food product. The shelves extend generally horizontally from a rear wall of the refrigerated merchandiser and are arranged vertically relative to one another within the display area. Existing refrigerated merchandisers cool food products on the shelves from the rear wall of the merchandiser forward by discharging cooling air from rear wall apertures. Cooling fans circulate the cooling air forward.</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">A particular challenge of open refrigerated merchandisers is maintaining a uniform temperature within the display area. The front of the display is not only further from the discharged cooling air but is also exposed to warmer ambient air infiltrating the air curtain. Therefore, the front of the display is warmer than the rear of the display. Current methods for homogenizing the temperature within the display area include increasing air velocity within the case and additional convection cooling apparatuses. The current solutions, however, require more energy usage and have variable efficacy depending on product layout and snowing-up patterns of the evaporator.</p>
<heading id="h-0003" level="1">SUMMARY</heading>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">In one aspect, the present invention provides a refrigerated merchandiser including a case defining a product display area and including an air inlet and an air outlet in communication with the product display area to form an air curtain across a front of the product display area. The refrigerated merchandiser also includes a shelf that is coupled to the case within the product display area. The shelf includes insulation between a top and a bottom of the shelf, and a passive heat exchanger that has a heat pipe embedded in the shelf within the insulation and that extends from a front of the shelf to a back of the shelf. Ambient air infiltrating the air curtain initiates passive heat transfer within the plurality of heat tubes.</p>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">In another aspect, the invention provides a shelf configured to be attached to a merchandiser. The shelf includes a top wall, a front wall coupled to the top wall, side walls coupled to the front wall and the top wall, and a bottom wall coupled to the front wall and the sidewalls to enclose a space between the top wall, the front wall, the side walls, and the bottom wall. The shelf also includes insulation disposed in the space and a passive heat exchanger disposed in the space. The passive heat exchanger has a heat pipe that is embedded within the insulation and that extends from a front of the shelf to a back of the shelf. Passive heat transfer is configured to be initiated by ambient air infiltrating the merchandiser.</p>

<p id="p-0018" num="0017">Before any embodiments of the application are explained in detail, it is to be understood that the application is not limited in its application to the details of construction and the arrangement of components set forth in the following description or illustrated in the following drawings. The application is capable of other embodiments and of being practiced or of being carried out in various ways.</p>
<heading id="h-0005" level="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION</heading>
<p id="p-0019" num="0018"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref> illustrates a refrigerated merchandiser <b>10</b> that may be located in a supermarket or a convenience store for displaying fresh food product <b>14</b> to consumers. The merchandiser <b>10</b> includes a case <b>18</b> having a base <b>22</b>, a rear wall <b>26</b>, sidewalls (not shown), a canopy <b>30</b>, and a customer access opening <b>34</b>. The rear wall <b>26</b>, base <b>22</b>, sidewalls, and canopy <b>30</b> cooperate to define a partially enclosed product display area <b>38</b>. The product display area <b>38</b> supports the food product <b>14</b> in the case <b>18</b>. The food product <b>14</b> is displayed on a plurality of shelves <b>42</b> within the product display area <b>38</b>. Each shelf <b>42</b> projects forward from the rear wall <b>26</b> and is accessible through the access opening <b>34</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0020" num="0019">In the embodiment of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>, the refrigerated merchandiser <b>10</b> is an open-front merchandiser with access opening <b>34</b> exposed to an ambient environment. In other embodiments, the access opening <b>34</b> may be enclosed by one or more doors (e.g., separated by mullions). The merchandiser <b>10</b> includes a refrigeration system <b>44</b> (not entirely shown) that is in communication with the product display area <b>38</b> to provide refrigerated air (denoted by arrows <b>48</b>) to the product display area <b>38</b>. As shown, the refrigeration system <b>44</b> includes an evaporator <b>52</b> that is disposed in an air passageway <b>56</b> of the case <b>18</b>, a compressor (not shown), and a condenser (not shown) connected in series. Refrigerated airflow <b>48</b> exits the evaporator <b>52</b> and is directed through the air passageway <b>56</b> and is discharged into the display area <b>38</b> as an air curtain that maintains proper temperature conductions for food product <b>14</b> on display.</p>
<p id="p-0021" num="0020">The airflow <b>48</b> is discharged through the canopy <b>30</b> through an air outlet <b>60</b> and is directed downward through the product display area <b>38</b> toward the base <b>22</b>. At least a portion of the airflow <b>48</b> is returned to the air passageway <b>56</b> of the refrigeration system <b>44</b> via an air inlet <b>64</b>. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>, the airflow <b>48</b> is drawn into the air passageway <b>56</b> by a fan <b>68</b> upstream of the evaporator <b>52</b>. The air inlet <b>64</b> is located adjacent a bottom end of the display area <b>38</b> and the air outlet <b>60</b> is located adjacent a top end of the product display area <b>38</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0022" num="0021">With continued reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>, the rear wall <b>26</b> includes an inner panel <b>72</b> that at least partially defines the air passageway <b>56</b>. The inner panel <b>72</b> includes a plurality of perforations <b>76</b> that are in communication with the air passageway <b>56</b>. The perforations <b>76</b> allow a portion of the airflow <b>48</b> to discharge from the air passageway <b>56</b> along a rear portion of the refrigerated merchandiser <b>10</b> and into the product display area <b>38</b>. In some embodiments, the perforations <b>76</b> include a matrix of circular openings through the inner panel <b>72</b>. In other embodiments, the perforations <b>76</b> may be vents that are constructed as elongate (e.g., rectangular) openings through the inner panel <b>72</b>. It will be appreciated that various other shapes, sizes, and arrangements for the perforations <b>76</b> are also possible in other embodiments.</p>
<p id="p-0023" num="0022">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref>, each of the shelves <b>42</b> includes a top wall <b>80</b>, two sidewalls <b>84</b>, and a front wall <b>88</b>. Some or all of the walls <b>80</b>, <b>84</b>, <b>88</b> may be separate pieces that are coupled together, or some or all of the walls <b>80</b>, <b>84</b>, <b>88</b> may be formed by bending or shaping a single piece of material such that edges are defined between the walls (i.e. the walls are coupled together at the edge). It will be appreciated that two or more of the walls may be coupled together by insulation <b>89</b>. In the illustrated embodiment, the top wall <b>80</b>, the sidewalls <b>84</b>, and the front wall <b>88</b> cooperate to define an interior volume of the shelf <b>42</b>. In some embodiments, the walls <b>80</b>, <b>84</b>, <b>88</b> form a solid shelf <b>42</b> (i.e. filled with insulation <b>89</b>). With reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>1</b> and <b>2</b></figref>, the shelf <b>42</b> is coupled to the rear wall <b>26</b> (e.g., via brackets <b>90</b>) and projects forward toward the front of the merchandiser <b>10</b>. As shown, the top wall <b>80</b> projects generally perpendicular from the inner panel <b>72</b> and the sidewalls <b>84</b> and the front wall <b>88</b> extend substantially perpendicular to the top wall <b>80</b>. In some embodiments, the shelves <b>42</b> may include a bottom wall <b>92</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0024" num="0023">With reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>2</b> and <b>3</b></figref>, one or more of the shelves <b>42</b> includes a passive heat exchanger <b>100</b>. The illustrated passive heat exchanger <b>100</b> is formed by one or more thermally conductive heat pipes <b>102</b> (e.g., with a thermal conductivity range between 1,000 and 10,000 W/m&#xb0; K). As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>2</b>, <b>3</b>, and <b>9</b></figref>, each heat pipe <b>102</b> is defined by an elongate tube (e.g., a cylindrical or rectangular prism) that supports a wick <b>103</b> and a working fluid <b>104</b>, and that has a first end <b>106</b> positioned at or adjacent the front wall <b>88</b> and a second end <b>110</b> positioned at or adjacent the inner panel <b>72</b>. Each heat pipe <b>102</b> may be embedded in the shelf <b>42</b> and may be coupled to the interior of the shelf via elongate grooves <b>114</b> (e.g., defined within insulation <b>89</b>). The heat pipes <b>102</b> can be secured within the elongate grooves <b>114</b> by a press-fit attachment, soldering or welding, thermal epoxies, or any other suitable attachment mechanism. It will be appreciated that the heat pipes <b>102</b> may be coupled to an underside of the top wall <b>80</b> without grooves (e.g., adhered or otherwise attached to the top wall <b>80</b>, sandwiched between the top wall and the bottom wall <b>92</b>, etc.).</p>
<p id="p-0025" num="0024">The heat pipes <b>102</b> are metallic and are vacuumed-sealed. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>9</b></figref>, the wick <b>103</b> defines a capillary lining that may be fixed to the inner walls of the heat pipe <b>102</b> and may include a metallic material (e.g., sintered copper, screen mesh, grooved metal, etc.). Other wicking materials that are suitable for flow of the working fluid <b>104</b> through the wick <b>103</b> may be used in combination with or in lieu of metallic material. The first end <b>106</b>, which is proximate to the customer access opening <b>32</b> and the front of the shelf <b>42</b>, defines an evaporator side of the heat pipe <b>102</b>. The second end <b>110</b>, which is proximate to the inner panel <b>72</b> and the rear of the shelf <b>42</b> defines a condenser side of the heat pipe <b>102</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0026" num="0025">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref>, the passive heat exchanger <b>100</b> includes six linear heat pipes <b>102</b> that extend between the rear wall of the shelf <b>42</b> and the front wall <b>88</b> in a direction that is perpendicular to the front wall <b>88</b>. The illustrated heat pipes <b>102</b> also are parallel to each other. It will be appreciated that the shelf <b>42</b> may have fewer than six heat pipes or more than six heat pipes. The heat pipes <b>102</b> form a one- or two-phase heat transfer mechanism to transfer infiltrating heat adjacent the front of the shelf <b>42</b> toward the rear of the shelf <b>42</b>. to maintain more uniform temperature within the product display area <b>38</b>, especially in regions adjacent the heat pipe <b>102</b> on the shelf <b>42</b>. The passive heat exchanger <b>100</b> limits temperature fluctuations by cooling the portion of the shelf <b>42</b> adjacent the access opening <b>34</b> to reduce or eliminate the warmer region. This results in a uniform temperature profile across the shelf <b>42</b> and a more consistent overall temperature within the merchandiser <b>10</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0027" num="0026">The passive heat exchanger <b>100</b> can be retrofit into existing merchandisers (e.g., by replacing existing shelves with shelves <b>42</b> that have the passive heat exchanger <b>100</b>. Separately or in addition, the passive heat exchanger <b>100</b> may be integrated into different parts of the merchandiser <b>10</b> to facilitate even distribution of conditioning air relative to warm and cold areas within the merchandiser <b>10</b>. For example, and with reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>, the merchandiser may include a deck plate <b>134</b> that partially defines the display area <b>38</b> (i.e. a lower boundary of the display area <b>38</b>). The deck plate <b>134</b> is positioned above the base <b>22</b> and, in some embodiments, a passive heat exchanger that is the same as the passive heat exchanger <b>100</b> may be embedded in the deck plate <b>134</b> (e.g., in an insulation-filled cavity in the deck plate <b>134</b>).</p>
<p id="p-0028" num="0027">In operation, refrigerated airflow <b>48</b> may be discharged through the plurality of perforations <b>76</b> and into the display area <b>38</b>. In some constructions, conditioned air may only be distributed to the product display area <b>38</b> via the air outlet <b>60</b> (e.g., when the merchandiser <b>10</b> does not include the perforations <b>76</b>), or in combination with the perforations <b>76</b>. Ambient air may infiltrate the display area <b>38</b> through the access opening <b>34</b>. The ambient air is generally warmer than the refrigerated airflow <b>48</b> forming the air curtain <b>48</b> at the front of the customer access opening <b>34</b>. The ambient air heats the working fluid within the first end <b>106</b> of the heat pipe <b>102</b>. The working fluid vaporizes on the evaporator side and increases pressure within the heat pipe <b>102</b>. As the pressure increases, the vaporized working fluid flows rearward via the wick toward the condenser side, proximate the inner panel <b>72</b>. At the second end <b>110</b>, the vaporized working fluid discharges heat as it is cooled and condensed. The condensed working fluid travels back toward the warmer first end <b>106</b>, evenly distributing a cooling effect within the display area <b>38</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0029" num="0028"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b></figref> illustrates an exemplary refrigerated merchandiser <b>10</b> with a passive heat exchanger <b>100</b> including a heat pipe <b>102</b> that is embedded in the shelf <b>42</b>, which supports food product <b>14</b>. Temperature sensors <b>118</b> are coupled to the top wall <b>80</b> (e.g., in a test environment) to measure temperatures of the shelf <b>42</b> in different locations (e.g., over a section <b>120</b> of the shelf <b>42</b>). For example, and as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b></figref>, one or more sensors <b>118</b> are positioned on the exterior side of the top wall <b>80</b> directly over the heat pipe <b>102</b>, and other sensors <b>118</b> are positioned on the top wall <b>80</b> opposite sides of the heat pipe <b>102</b> (e.g., on a side to the left of the heat pipe <b>102</b> and on a side to the right of the heat pipe <b>102</b>). The portions of the shelf <b>102</b> to the left and the right of the heat pipe <b>102</b> define left and right test sections of the shelf <b>42</b>, respectively, and the portion of the shelf <b>102</b> that is centered over the heat pipe defines a center test section.</p>
<p id="p-0030" num="0029"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b></figref> graphically illustrates an average temperature profile of an exemplary shelf <b>42</b> that includes the heat pipe <b>102</b> when the evaporator <b>52</b> has a setpoint of 26&#xb0; Fahrenheit. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>7</b></figref> illustrates temperature data provided by the sensors <b>118</b> in the left test section, the center test section, and the right test section. As shown, the heat pipe <b>102</b> maintains a more uniform surface temperature on the shelf <b>42</b> (at the center) when compared to the left and right test sections that do not include a heat pipe. More specifically, and with reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>7</b></figref>, the average temperature difference or variation on the top wall <b>80</b> in the center test section, from adjacent the front of the shelf <b>42</b> to adjacent the inner panel <b>72</b>, is approximately 2.1&#xb0; Fahrenheit, whereas the average temperature differences on the top wall <b>80</b> in the left test section and the right test section (from front-to-back on the top wall <b>80</b>) are approximately 7.4&#xb0; and 7.3&#xb0; Fahrenheit, respectively. Stated another way, the heat pipe <b>102</b> decreases the temperature variation on the top wall <b>80</b>, on average, from front to back by approximately 70% relative to sections or portions of the shelf <b>42</b> without a heat pipe. The second chart in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>7</b></figref> illustrates the temperature profile of the shelf <b>42</b> in the left, center, and right test sections when the refrigeration system <b>44</b> is in a defrost mode. As will be appreciated by one of ordinary skill in the art, even during defrost the heat pipe <b>102</b> maintains a more uniform (e.g., a decrease in temperature variation of approximately 58%) and lower overall surface temperature on the shelf <b>42</b> relative to the sections to the left and right of the heat pipe <b>102</b>. The third chart in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>7</b></figref> illustrates the temperature profiles of the left, center, and right test sections of the shelf <b>42</b> soon after defrost has been terminated (e.g., before frost buildup in the evaporator <b>52</b>) and shows that the heat pipe <b>102</b> maintains a more uniform temperature profile from front to back on the shelf <b>42</b> than in the left and right test sections (e.g., a 70% decrease in temperature variation on the top wall <b>80</b> from front to back relative to sections or portions of the shelf <b>42</b> without a heat pipe).</p>
<p id="p-0031" num="0030"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>6</b> and <b>8</b></figref> illustrate similar uniformity in the temperature variation, from front to back, for food product (tested using food product simulators) that is supported on the shelf <b>42</b> over the heat pipe <b>102</b> and a decrease in temperature variation relative to food product that is supported on the shelf <b>42</b> to the left and right of the food product supported over the heat pipe <b>102</b>. More specifically, and with reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>8</b></figref>, the average temperature difference or variation for food product in the center test section, from adjacent the front of the shelf <b>42</b> to adjacent the inner panel <b>72</b>, is approximately 5.9&#xb0; Fahrenheit, whereas the average temperature differences for food product in the left test section and the right test section (from front-to-back) are approximately 8.2&#xb0; and 8.1&#xb0; Fahrenheit, respectively. Stated another way, the heat pipe <b>102</b> decreases the temperature variation of food product, on average, from front to back by approximately 27% relative to food product on sections or portions of the shelf <b>42</b> without a heat pipe. The second chart in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>8</b></figref> illustrates the temperature profile of food product in the left, center, and right test sections when the refrigeration system <b>44</b> is in a defrost mode. Even during defrost, the heat pipe <b>102</b> maintains a more uniform (e.g., approximately a 25% decrease in temperature variation) and lower overall temperature of food product relative to the sections to the left and right of the heat pipe <b>102</b>. The third chart in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>8</b></figref> illustrates the temperature profiles of food product supported in the left, center, and right test sections of the shelf <b>42</b> soon after defrost has been terminated (e.g., before frost buildup in the evaporator <b>52</b>) and shows that the heat pipe <b>102</b> maintains a more uniform temperature profile from front to back on the shelf <b>42</b> than in the left and right test sections (e.g., a 27% decrease in temperature variation from front to back relative to food product in sections or portions of the shelf <b>42</b> without a heat pipe).</p>
<p id="p-0032" num="0031">In some embodiments, the top wall <b>80</b> be encapsulated by a shelf cover and may be formed of a material suitable to spread the cooling impact of the heat pipe <b>102</b> (e.g., metal) toward and at least partially into the sections of the shelf <b>42</b> that are adjacent and to the left or right of the heat pipe <b>102</b>. The heat pipe(s) <b>102</b> may be embedded in insulation <b>89</b> to facilitate a more significant and direct impact on the temperature of the shelf <b>42</b> and food product supported on the shelf <b>42</b>. Also, by using several heat pipes <b>102</b> in a given shelf <b>42</b> (and or/in the deck plate <b>134</b>), the heat pipes <b>102</b> can be spaced so that sections of the shelf <b>42</b> between the heat pipes <b>102</b> are minimized to avoid less uniform temperature variations from front to back on the shelf <b>42</b>. In general, the embedded heat pipe <b>102</b> makes the cooling effect predictable and reliable regardless the layout or loading of product on the shelf <b>42</b>. Existing systems that use an evaporator coil in a shelf cannot achieve the uniformity of temperature, from front to back in the product display area <b>38</b>, associated with the invention described herein.</p>
