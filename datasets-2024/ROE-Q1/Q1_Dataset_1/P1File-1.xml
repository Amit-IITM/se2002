<abstract id="abstract">
<p id="p-0001" num="0000">A row unit (<b>10</b>) of an agricultural planter with an apparatus for adjusting the depth of a trench opened by the row unit (<b>10</b>). The row unit (<b>10</b>) includes a trench depth adjustment assembly (<b>90</b>T) configured to modify the trench depth. The trench depth adjustment assembly (<b>90</b>T) includes a depth adjustment body (<b>5044</b>) pivotally connected via a pivot to a frame member (<b>14</b>) of the row unit (<b>10</b>). An electric motor (<b>5030</b>) is operable to cause rotation of a shaft (<b>5038</b>) operably coupled with the depth adjustment body (<b>5044</b>), whereby rotation of the shaft (<b>5038</b>) causes the depth adjustment body (<b>5044</b>) to pivotally move about the pivot (<b>92</b>) thereby changing a position of contact of the depth adjustment body (<b>5044</b>) with a gauge wheel arm (<b>54</b>), thus changing the amount of upward ravel of the gauge wheel (<b>52</b>) with respect to a trench opening disc (<b>62</b>) and thus the depth of the trench.</p>

<heading id="h-0001" level="1">BACKGROUND</heading>
<p id="p-0002" num="0001">In recent years, farmers have recognized the need to select and maintain the proper planting depth to ensure the proper seed environment (e.g., temperature and moisture) and seedling emergence. To improve agronomic practices, it would also be desirable for the farmer to understand the relationship between actual planting depth and metrics such as emergence and yield. Conventional agricultural planters include only apparatus for adjusting a maximum planting depth, which may not be maintained during operation due to soil conditions or insufficient down-pressure on the planter row unit. Even in operation of modern planters having sensors for determining whether full trench depth has been lost, the actual depth planted is still not determined. Thus there is a need for systems, methods and apparatus for controlling and/or measuring the depth of a trench opened by an agricultural planter.</p>

<p id="p-0076" num="0075">Referring now to the drawings, wherein like reference numerals designate identical or corresponding parts throughout the several views, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref> illustrates an agricultural implement, e.g., a planter, comprising a toolbar <b>8</b> to which multiple row units <b>10</b> are mounted in transversely spaced relation. Each row unit <b>10</b> is preferably mounted to the toolbar by a parallel arm arrangement <b>16</b> such that the row unit is permitted to translate vertically with respect to the toolbar. A downforce actuator <b>18</b> may be mounted to the toolbar <b>8</b> and the parallel arm arrangement <b>16</b> and configured to apply supplemental down-pressure to the row unit <b>10</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0077" num="0076">The row unit <b>10</b> includes a frame <b>14</b> which supports an opening disc assembly <b>60</b>. The opening assembly <b>60</b> may include two angled opening discs <b>62</b> rollingly mounted to a downwardly extending shank <b>15</b> of the frame <b>14</b>. The opening discs <b>62</b> open a v-shaped trench <b>3</b> (i.e., furrow, seed furrow) in the soil surface <b>7</b> as the row unit <b>10</b> advances in a forward direction of travel through the field. The row unit <b>10</b> includes a gauge wheel assembly <b>50</b> which may comprise two gauge wheels <b>52</b> pivotally mounted to either side of the frame <b>14</b> by two gauge wheel arms <b>54</b>. The gauge wheels <b>52</b> roll along the surface of the soil. A depth adjustment assembly <b>90</b> pivotally mounted to the frame <b>14</b> at a pivot <b>92</b> contacts the gauge wheel arms <b>54</b> to limit the upward travel of the gauge wheel arms <b>54</b>, thus limiting the depth of the trench opened by the opening disc assembly <b>60</b>. A closing assembly <b>40</b> is preferably pivotally coupled to the frame <b>14</b> and configured to move soil back into the trench <b>3</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0078" num="0077">Continuing to refer to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>, seeds <b>5</b> are communicated from a hopper <b>12</b> to a seed meter <b>30</b> configured to singulate the supplied seeds. The meter <b>30</b> may be a vacuum-type meter such as that disclosed in Applicant's International Patent Pub. No. WO/2012/129442, the disclosure of which is hereby incorporated by reference herein in its entirety. In operation, the seed meter <b>30</b> preferably deposits the supplied seeds into a seed tube <b>32</b> which may be removably mounted to the frame <b>14</b>. In operation, seeds <b>5</b> deposited by the meter <b>30</b> fall through the seed tube <b>32</b> into the trench <b>3</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0079" num="0078">Turning to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>2</b>-<b>6</b></figref>, the depth adjustment assembly <b>90</b> is illustrated in more detail. The depth adjustment assembly <b>90</b> includes a rocker <b>95</b> pivotally mounted to a depth adjustment body <b>94</b>. The depth adjustment body <b>94</b> is pivotally mounted to the row unit frame <b>14</b> about the pivot <b>92</b>. A handle <b>98</b> is slidably received within the depth adjustment body <b>94</b> such that the user can selectively engage and disengage the handle (e.g., left and right hooks <b>99</b>-<b>1</b>, <b>99</b>-<b>2</b>, respectively, which may be formed as a part of the handle <b>98</b>) with one of a plurality of depth adjustment slots <b>97</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>6</b></figref>) formed within the row unit frame <b>14</b>. With reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>7</b></figref>, the handle <b>98</b> is partially slidingly received within a cavity <b>710</b> of the depth adjustment body <b>94</b>, and an optional spring <b>730</b> engages an annular lip <b>740</b> disposed on the bottom end of the handle <b>98</b>. The spring <b>730</b> imposes a resilient force to retain the hooks <b>99</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>6</b></figref>) in the selected slot <b>97</b>, but permits the user to withdraw the handle <b>98</b> to temporarily disengage the hooks <b>99</b> from the slot <b>97</b>. In operation, the upward travel of the gauge wheels <b>52</b> is limited by contact of the gauge wheel arms <b>54</b> with the rocker <b>95</b>. When one of the gauge wheels, e.g., left gauge wheel <b>52</b>-<b>1</b>, encounters an obstruction, the rocker <b>95</b> allows the left gauge wheel arm <b>54</b>-<b>1</b> to travel upward while lowering the right gauge wheel <b>52</b>-<b>2</b> by the same absolute displacement such that the row unit <b>10</b> rises by half the height of the obstruction. It should be appreciated that there are other row units with manual adjustments similar to those described herein. Non-limiting examples can be found in U.S. Publication Nos. US20170000003 and US20170006757, both of which are incorporated herein by reference. The depth adjustment assemblies described herein work with similar systems with rockers, pivot, and adjustment arms.</p>
<p id="p-0080" num="0079">It should be appreciated that the handle <b>98</b> and depth adjustment body <b>94</b> comprise a primary depth adjustment sub-assembly configured to permit the user to select one of a plurality of pre-selected furrow depths. The pre-selected furrow depths each correspond to one of the depth adjustment slots <b>97</b>. In some embodiments, as described in detail later, rather than using the handle <b>98</b> to manually select a depth adjustment slot, an actuator may be used to adjust the position of handle <b>98</b>; for example, a linear actuator (not shown) mounted to the row unit frame <b>14</b> may be disposed to adjust the position of the handle <b>98</b>. Alternatively, a rotary actuator may turn a gear which adjusts the position of the handle relative to the depth adjustment slots <b>97</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0081" num="0080">In each of the embodiments illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>7</b>-<b>10</b>A and <b>12</b></figref>, a secondary depth adjustment assembly is configured to modify one or more of the pre-selected furrow depths. The secondary depth adjustment assembly may modify the pre-selected furrow depths by more precise adjustments (e.g., by smaller adjustment steps) than the depth modifications enabled by the primary depth adjustment assembly (e.g., by selecting which depth adjustment slot <b>97</b> is engaged by the handle <b>98</b>). For example, referring <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>7</b></figref>, the depth adjustment assembly <b>90</b>A includes an actuator <b>720</b> which adjusts the effective length of the depth adjustment assembly <b>90</b>A. In the illustrated embodiment, the extension of actuator <b>720</b> determines the position of the rocker <b>95</b> relative to the depth adjustment body <b>94</b>. As illustrated, the rocker <b>95</b> is pivotally mounted to a movable member <b>770</b> having a cavity <b>775</b> for receiving a protrusion <b>760</b> mounted to (or formed as a part with) the depth adjustment body <b>94</b>. The protrusion <b>760</b> and cavity <b>775</b> retain the alignment of the moveable member relative to the depth adjustment body <b>94</b>, but permit the actuator <b>720</b> to modify the position along an axis which is parallel to the pivot axis of the rocker <b>95</b>. It should be appreciated that modification of the extension of actuator <b>720</b> (and thus the effective length of the depth adjustment assembly) modifies the furrow depth for any given depth setting of the handle <b>98</b>. Any of the secondary depth adjustment assemblies described herein may be used as the only depth adjustment, such that the primary depth adjustment does not need to be set, and whereby the secondary depth adjustment can adjust the depth adjustment body <b>94</b> across the entire range of depth settings.</p>
<p id="p-0082" num="0081"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>8</b></figref> illustrates another embodiment of a depth adjustment assembly <b>90</b>B having a secondary depth adjustment assembly wherein an actuator <b>800</b> modifies the angular position at which one or more gauge wheel arms <b>54</b> is stopped by the depth adjustment assembly <b>90</b>B for any given setting of the depth adjustment handle <b>98</b>. The actuator <b>800</b> adjusts a position of a surface <b>810</b> which is pivotally mounted to the gauge wheel arm <b>54</b>; the surface <b>810</b> is disposed to contact the rocker <b>95</b> at the point of maximum upward travel of the gauge wheel arm <b>54</b>. Extension of the actuator <b>800</b> and thus modification of the position of surface <b>810</b> thus modifies the point of maximum upward travel of the gauge wheel and thus modifies the furrow depth determined by the gauge wheel. In some embodiments, a functionally similar actuator <b>800</b> and pivotally-mounted surface <b>810</b> may be mounted to both gauge wheel arms <b>54</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0083" num="0082"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>9</b></figref> illustrates another embodiment of a depth adjustment assembly <b>90</b>C having a secondary depth adjustment assembly wherein a modified rocker <b>900</b> is configured to modify its shape in order to modify the furrow depth for any given depth setting of the handle <b>98</b>. The rocker <b>900</b> includes portions <b>910</b>-<b>1</b>, <b>910</b>-<b>2</b> which contact the gauge wheel arms <b>54</b>-<b>1</b> and <b>54</b>-<b>2</b>, respectively, to limit the upward travel of the gauge wheel arms. An actuator <b>950</b> changes the angle between the portions <b>910</b>-<b>1</b> and <b>910</b>-<b>2</b> and thus the shape of the rocker <b>900</b>. Retraction of the actuator <b>950</b> raises the members <b>910</b> and thus modifies the maximum height of the gauge wheel arms <b>54</b> and the furrow depth.</p>
<p id="p-0084" num="0083"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>10</b></figref> illustrates another embodiment of a depth adjustment assembly <b>90</b>D having a secondary depth adjustment assembly wherein the rocker <b>95</b> is pivotally mounted to the depth adjustment body <b>94</b>, preferably about a laterally extending axis defined by pivot <b>1010</b>. An actuator <b>1000</b> preferably determines the angular position of the rocker <b>95</b> about the pivot <b>1010</b> relative to the depth adjustment body <b>94</b>, thus modifying the maximum upward travel of the gauge wheel arms <b>54</b> and the furrow depth.</p>
<p id="p-0085" num="0084"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>10</b>A</figref> illustrates an alternative to the embodiment illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>10</b></figref>. In this embodiment, pivot <b>1010</b> from <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>10</b></figref> is removed, and rocker <b>95</b> is attached to connector <b>1011</b>, which pivots about pivot <b>92</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0086" num="0085"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>12</b></figref> illustrates yet another embodiment of a depth adjustment assembly <b>90</b>E having a secondary depth adjustment assembly wherein an actuator <b>1230</b> advances a depth adjustment member <b>1210</b> (e.g., a wedge) which is slidingly fixed to the gauge wheel arm and disposed to slide along the length of the gauge wheel arm <b>54</b>. An actuator <b>1230</b> (e.g., a linear actuator such as an electric, hydraulic, or pneumatic actuator) selectively modifies (e.g., by extension or retraction) the position of the depth adjustment member <b>1210</b>, e.g., along the length of the gauge wheel arm <b>54</b>. The position of the depth adjustment member <b>1210</b> along the length of the gauge wheel arm modifies the uppermost angular position of the gauge wheel arm relative to the rocker <b>95</b> and thus modifies the depth of the furrow opened by the row unit in operation. The actuator <b>1230</b> may be mounted to the gauge wheel arm <b>54</b>, e.g., by being fixed to a plate <b>1225</b> mounted to the gauge wheel arm <b>54</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0087" num="0086">In some embodiments, the actuator <b>1230</b> may adjust the position of the depth adjustment member <b>1210</b> by means of a biasing mechanism. The biasing mechanism may increase or reduces a biasing force on the wedge <b>1210</b> as the actuator <b>1230</b> is extended. For example, as illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>12</b></figref>, the actuator <b>1230</b> may modify a position of a biasing member such as a plate <b>1220</b> relative to the depth adjustment member <b>1210</b>. Optionally, a first spring <b>1215</b><i>a </i>is may be fixed to the depth adjustment member <b>1210</b> at a first end thereof and may be fixed to the plate <b>1220</b> at a second end thereof. Optionally, a second spring <b>1215</b><i>b </i>may be fixed to the plate <b>1220</b> at a first end thereof and may be fixed to the plate <b>1225</b> at a second end thereof. In the undeflected position shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>12</b></figref>, neither of the springs <b>1215</b><i>a, </i><b>1215</b><i>b </i>impose a substantial force on the biasing member <b>1210</b>. As the actuator <b>1230</b> advances from the undeflected position, the spring imposes an increasing advancing force on the biasing member <b>1220</b> (e.g., generally toward the rocker <b>95</b>). As the actuator <b>1230</b> retracts from the undeflected position, the spring imposes an increasing retracting force on the biasing member <b>1220</b> (e.g., generally away from the rocker <b>95</b>).</p>
<p id="p-0088" num="0087">In operation, when a component of force transmitted from the actuator <b>1230</b> (e.g., via the spring <b>1215</b><i>a </i>of the biasing mechanism illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>12</b></figref>) to the rocker <b>95</b> exceeds an oppositely acting force of the rocker <b>95</b> on the gauge wheel arm (or on the depth adjustment member if the rocker is already contacting the depth adjustment member), the depth adjustment member <b>1210</b> advances, forcing the rocker <b>95</b> farther away from the gauge wheel arm and reducing the furrow depth. It should be appreciated that the biasing force may be built up gradually by extension of the actuator <b>1230</b> without being sufficient to advance the depth adjustment member <b>1210</b> until sufficient extension of the actuator or until reduction of downforce.</p>

<p id="p-0120" num="0119">In one method of calibrating the depth adjustment assembly <b>90</b>P, the actuator <b>2050</b> is &#x201c;homed&#x201d; or &#x201c;zeroed&#x201d; with respect to a starting position. The zero or home position may be associated with the shallowest setting, with the deepest setting, with the shallowest and the deepest setting, or with a known depth between the shallowest and deepest settings, such as, for example, a two inch depth.</p>
<p id="p-0121" num="0120">By way of example, to zero or home the actuator <b>2050</b> to the shallowest depth, the motor <b>2030</b> is commanded to actuate via the planter monitor <b>50</b> to cause the gears to engage and rotate to move the depth adjustment body <b>1994</b> along the gear rack <b>2010</b> toward the shallowest position until the gear box <b>1920</b> or depth adjustment body <b>1994</b> abuts with a positive stop on the gear rack <b>1910</b>. When the positive stop is reached, the current detected by one of the current sensors <b>2016</b>, <b>2018</b> will begin to spike, indicating the gear box <b>1920</b> or depth adjustment body <b>1994</b> is at the shallowest setting possible, which establishes the zero or home position. The detected current spike associated with the zero or home position may be between 5% to 20% of the full motor current. For example, if the motor <b>2030</b> is an 18 amp motor, when the current reaches 2 amps (i.e., approximately 10% of the full motor current), the motor is commanded to shut off, and that position is associated with the &#x201c;zero&#x201d; or &#x201c;home&#x201d; position. In other words the motor may be commanded to shut off before the current reaches full current to save the motor from being overworked. In other embodiments, the current spike may be no more than 95% of the full motor current, or no more than 90%, or no more than 80%, or no more than 70%, or no more than 60%, or no more than 50%, or no more than 40%, or no more than 30%, or no more than 25% of the full motor current.</p>
<p id="p-0122" num="0121">Once home or zero is established, a block of a known thickness (e.g., two inches) is placed under each gauge wheel <b>52</b>-<b>1</b>, <b>52</b>-<b>2</b> to simulate a known trench depth setting (i.e., the permitted travel distance of the gauge wheels with respect to the opener disks). The motor <b>2030</b> is then commanded to actuate to cause the gears to engage and rotate to move the depth adjustment body <b>1994</b> toward the deepest trench depth setting until another spike in the current is detected by one of the current sensors <b>2016</b>, <b>2018</b>, indicating that the gauge wheels are pressing firmly against the blocks and establishing that the predefined trench depth setting has been reached (e.g., the two inch depth corresponding to the block thickness). As the depth adjustment moves from the shallowest position until reaching the predefined block depth setting, the number of revolutions of the motor <b>2030</b> or motor shaft <b>1931</b> are counted via the Hall effect sensor detecting the rotation of the magnet <b>2010</b> (which rotates with the motor <b>2030</b> or motor shaft <b>1931</b>). The counted number of revolutions, whether of the motor <b>2030</b> or motor shaft <b>1931</b>, are hereinafter referred to as &#x201c;revolution counts.&#x201d; The number of revolution counts will therefore correspond to the predefined depth setting (which, in this example, is a two inch depth based on the known thickness of the block placed under the gauge wheels). Therefore after calibrating to a known block thickness, the relationship (linear or non-linear depending on the shape of the row unit <b>10</b>) between revolution counts versus change in depth can be applied to determine the depth throughout the entire range of movement of the actuator <b>2050</b> or depth adjustment body <b>1994</b> with respect to the gear rack <b>1910</b> based on revolution counts.</p>
<p id="p-0123" num="0122">It should also be appreciated that rather than zeroing or homing the actuator to the shallowest depth, the actuator may be zeroed or homed to the deepest depth. In such a method, the motor <b>2030</b> is commanded to actuate via the planter monitor <b>50</b> to cause the gears to engage and rotate to move the depth adjustment body <b>1994</b> along the gear rack <b>2010</b> toward the deepest position until the gear box <b>1920</b> or depth adjustment body <b>1994</b> abuts with a positive stop on the gear rack <b>1910</b>. When the positive stop is reached, the current detected by one of the current sensors <b>2016</b>, <b>2018</b> will begin to spike, indicating the gear box <b>1920</b> or depth adjustment body <b>1994</b> is at the deepest setting possible, which establishes the zero or home position. Once zero or home is determined, a block of a known thickness (e.g., two inches) is placed under each gauge wheel <b>52</b>-<b>1</b>, <b>52</b>-<b>2</b> to simulate a known trench depth setting (i.e., the permitted travel distance of the gauge wheels with respect to the opener disks). A benefit to going to the deepest setting possible is that the weight of the planter is carried by opening discs <b>62</b> on each row unit <b>10</b> so that the planter does not need to be raised. This allows the block to be placed under each gauge wheel <b>52</b>. The motor <b>2030</b> is then commanded to actuate to cause the gears to engage and rotate to move the depth adjustment body <b>1994</b> toward the shallowest trench depth setting until another spike in the current is detected by one of the current sensors <b>2016</b>, <b>2018</b>, indicating that the gauge wheels are pressing firmly against the blocks indicating that the predefined trench depth setting has been reached (e.g., the two inch depth corresponding to the block thickness). As the depth adjustment body <b>1994</b> moves from the deepest position until reaching the predefined block depth setting, the number of revolutions of the motor <b>2030</b> or motor shaft <b>1931</b> are counted via the Hall effect sensor detecting the rotation of the magnet <b>2010</b> (which rotates with the motor <b>2030</b> or motor shaft <b>1931</b>). The number of revolution counts will therefore correspond to the predefined depth setting (which, in this example, is a two inch depth based on the known thickness of the block placed under the gauge wheels). Therefore, after calibrating to a known block thickness, the relationship (linear or non-linear depending on the shape of the row unit <b>10</b>) between motor revolutions versus change in depth can be applied to determine the depth throughout the entire range of movement of the actuator <b>2050</b> or depth adjustment body <b>1994</b> with respect to the gear rack <b>1910</b> based on revolution counts. After calibration, the depth can be set to maximum again so that the blocks can be removed without the need to raise the planter.</p>
<p id="p-0124" num="0123">It should also be appreciated that the zero or home position need not be at the shallowest or deepest position. Instead, the zero or home position may be associated with a known depth between the shallowest and deepest settings (e.g., a two inch depth). By way of example, if it is desired to associate the zero or home position with a two inch trench depth (i.e., the permitted travel distance of the gauge wheels with respect to the opener disks), the actuator <b>2050</b> or depth adjustment body <b>1994</b> may initially be placed at the shallowest or deepest setting and then a two inch thick block may be placed under each gauge wheel <b>52</b>-<b>1</b> and <b>52</b>-<b>2</b>. The motor <b>2030</b> may then be commanded to cause the depth adjustment body <b>1994</b> to travel toward the shallowest or deepest position. As the depth adjustment body <b>1994</b> moves toward the shallowest or deepest position, the motor revolutions are counted until a current spike is observed as the gauge wheels <b>52</b>-<b>1</b>, <b>52</b>-<b>2</b> start to contact the block. The position of the depth adjustment body <b>1994</b> where the current spike is detected (i.e., at the two inch depth in this example) is established as the zero or home position. When the actuator <b>2050</b> or depth adjustment body <b>1994</b> is moved from the established zero or home position toward a deeper or shallower setting, the number of rotations of the motor <b>2030</b> or motor shaft <b>1931</b> (in the direction of the increase or decrease of the depth) are counted from the established zero or home position. As previously described, the linear relationship between revolution counts versus change in depth can be applied to determine the depth throughout the entire range of movement of the actuator <b>2050</b> or depth adjustment body <b>1994</b> based on revolution counts.</p>
<p id="p-0125" num="0124">The above described calibration processes may be repeated for each row unit of the planter, which may be performed sequentially for each row unit or all row units may be calibrated simultaneously. It should be appreciated that only the zero or home position needs to be set, because the thickness of the block used under the gauge wheels is known which sets the trench depth. It should also be appreciated that not all rows need to be zeroed using the above methods. A subset of rows, for example, 50%, 33%, 25%, 20%, or any number less than 100%, may be zeroed or homed according to any of the above methods. The subset of rows that are zeroed are then averaged to provide an average zero or home that can then be applied across all rows equally or to the rows that were not zeroed.</p>
<p id="p-0126" num="0125">During the calibration process in any of the above examples for detecting the current spikes when the gauge wheels contact the blocks, a downforce sensor may be utilized to ensure consistent loading on the gauge wheels <b>52</b>-<b>1</b> and <b>52</b>-<b>2</b> across the various row units <b>10</b>. For example, a downforce system, such as the DeltaForce&#xae; system available from Precision Planting LLC, 23207 Townline Road, Tremont, Ill. 61568 (described in International Publication No. WO2014/018716), may be utilized to ensure consistent loading on the gauge wheels <b>52</b>-<b>1</b> and <b>52</b>-<b>2</b> at each row unit <b>10</b> to ensure uniform results across the agricultural implement.</p>
<p id="p-0127" num="0126">It should also be appreciated that the depth adjustment assembly <b>90</b>P may be manually calibrated by moving depth adjustment assembly <b>90</b>P to a zero or home location by activating manual button <b>2023</b> or <b>2024</b> to move depth adjustment assembly <b>90</b>P as previously described.</p>
<p id="p-0128" num="0127">When operating in a field, and in particular a no-till field, the gear rack <b>1910</b> could become filled with debris, which could limit the travel of the actuator <b>2050</b> on the gear rack <b>1910</b> causing an earlier current spike due to the depth adjustment body <b>1994</b> or gear box <b>1920</b> abutting the debris filling the gear rack <b>1910</b> instead of the depth adjustment body or gear box <b>1920</b> abutting the positive stop on the gear rack <b>1910</b>. This earlier or premature current spike due to abutment with the debris will result in a false or incorrect home or zero position. Accordingly, it may be desirable to home or zero the actuator <b>2050</b> or depth adjustment body <b>1994</b> at a midpoint of the gear rack <b>1910</b> or at some other point between either end of the gear rack <b>1910</b> where debris is unlikely to accumulate so as to avoiding a false or incorrect home or zero position.</p>
<p id="p-0129" num="0128"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>27</b></figref> is a rear perspective view of another embodiment of a depth adjustment assembly <b>90</b>Q. In this embodiment, the depth adjustment assembly <b>90</b>Q is substantially the same as the previously described depth adjustment assembly <b>90</b>P, but incorporates a homing system <b>1970</b> for homing the actuator <b>2050</b> or depth adjustment body <b>1994</b> with respect to a position on the gear rack <b>1910</b> between the ends of the gear rack <b>1910</b>. The homing system <b>1970</b> includes a sensor <b>1971</b> and a target <b>1972</b>. The target <b>1972</b> may be a magnet, and the sensor <b>1971</b> may be a Hall effect sensor. Alternatively, the sensor <b>1971</b> may be an inductive sensor, and the target <b>1972</b> may be a metal block detectable by the inductive sensor. The sensor <b>1971</b> may be disposed on the gear box housing <b>1925</b> and the target <b>1972</b> may be disposed on the gear rack <b>1910</b>, such as on one edge <b>1912</b>-<b>1</b>, <b>1912</b>-<b>2</b> of the shelf <b>1919</b>-<b>1</b>, <b>1919</b>-<b>2</b> at the midpoint of travel along gear rack <b>1910</b> or at another point that is not at either end of gear rack <b>1910</b>. The sensor <b>1971</b> may be connected to circuit board <b>2020</b>, which may be in data communication with the monitor <b>50</b>. Home or zero is established when the sensor <b>1971</b> is disposed over the target <b>1972</b>. Thus, if the target <b>1972</b> is at the midpoint of the gear rack <b>1910</b>, then the home or zero will be the midpoint of gear rack <b>1910</b>. As previously described, the linear relationship between revolution counts versus change in depth can be applied to determine the depth throughout the entire range of movement of the actuator <b>2050</b> or depth adjustment body <b>1994</b> based on revolution counts in either direction from the zero or home position.</p>
<p id="p-0130" num="0129">It should be appreciated that the homing system <b>1970</b> may be used in conjunction with or in the alternative to the zeroing or homing methods described above.</p>
<p id="p-0131" num="0130">As a verification or check of the depth based on the number of revolution counts as described above, the revolution counts may be correlated with the angle of the actuator <b>2050</b> or the depth adjustment body <b>1994</b> as detected by the accelerometer <b>2014</b>. The correlation of the revolution counts with actual measured angles detected by the accelerometer <b>2014</b> will ensure proper depth calibration to account for variations in geometry of components from the manufacturer and to account for worn components on the row unit. A standard calibration equation may be used to correlate the depth setting (based on revolution counts) since there is a predetermined number of pulses from the magnet and Hall effect sensor that correlate to a predetermined depth change. For example, tests have shown that 250 revolution counts (producing 250 pulses from the magnet rotating past the Hall effect sensor) correlates to roughly a 0.11 inch (0.28 cm) change in furrow depth, and this change in furrow depth in relation to revolution counts is substantially linear across the entire depth range. Therefore, after calibrating to a known block thickness or to a home position using the homing system <b>1970</b>, the linear relationship between revolution counts versus change in depth can be applied to determine the depth throughout the entire range of movement of the actuator <b>2050</b> or depth adjustment body <b>1994</b>. Similarly, if the change in planting depth is substantially linear in relation to revolution counts, the angle of the actuator <b>2050</b> or depth adjustment body <b>1994</b> as detected by the accelerometer <b>2014</b> can likewise be correlated using a standard calibration equation.</p>
<p id="p-0132" num="0131">In addition, it is known that different soils, tillage practices and field conditions can affect actual trench depth in comparison to trench depth settings. Thus, for example, if the commanded depth is 2 inches (5 cm), but measurement of the actual depth in the field reveals that the seed trench is only 1.5 inches (3.8 cm), an offset to the calibration may be applied to &#x201c;true-up&#x201d; the position of the actuator <b>2050</b> or the depth adjustment body <b>1994</b> with the actual trench depth to account for field conditions.</p>
<p id="p-0133" num="0132">It should be appreciated, however, that if the relationship between revolution counts with respect to change in depth across the entire range of movement of the actuator <b>2050</b> or depth adjustment body <b>1994</b> is not linear, a non-linear relationship may be required to correlate the depth with the revolution counts and with the measured angles detected by the accelerometer <b>2014</b>. Such non-linear correlation would be understood by those of ordinary skill in the art.</p>
<p id="p-0134" num="0133">For any of the depth adjustment assemblies described herein that have a motor as part of their actuator (e.g., <b>1450</b>, <b>1550</b>, <b>1650</b>, <b>1750</b>, <b>1850</b>, <b>1950</b>, <b>2050</b>), the set depth can be determined by the motors <b>1450</b>, <b>1550</b>, <b>1650</b>, <b>1730</b>, <b>1830</b>, <b>1930</b>, <b>1984</b>, <b>2030</b> based on their rotations in either direction. If motors <b>1450</b>, <b>1550</b>, <b>1650</b>, <b>1730</b>, <b>1830</b>, <b>1930</b>, <b>1984</b>, <b>2030</b> are stepper motors, the number of steps taken in either direction can be tracked by depth control and soil monitoring system <b>300</b>.</p>
<heading id="h-0005" level="1">Diagnostics</heading>
<p id="p-0135" num="0134">The angles detected by the accelerometer <b>2014</b> may be used as a diagnostic tool of the Hall effect sensors on the row units by comparing the angles detected for the depth adjustment body <b>1994</b> of one row unit with the readings of the accelerometers of the other row units on the planter. For example, if the angle detected by the accelerometer <b>2014</b> of one row unit is significantly different from the angles detected by the accelerometers <b>2014</b> of other row units, there may be a faulty Hall effect sensor not accurately counting revolutions of the motor <b>2030</b> or motor shaft <b>1931</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0136" num="0135">Additionally, if a repair or alteration is made to the row unit and the actuator <b>2050</b> is installed in a different position than its original position, the accelerometer <b>2014</b> will detect this discrepancy in relation to the reading of the accelerometers <b>2014</b> of the other row units and the discrepancy may be displayed to the operator on the planter monitor to notify the operator that an adjustment is necessary.</p>
<p id="p-0137" num="0136">Also, the SRM accelerometer may be referenced to verify the position of the actuator <b>2050</b>. For example, assuming the planter is operating on flat ground and the accelerometer <b>2014</b> and the actuator <b>2050</b> is at a 30 degree angle on the gear rack <b>1910</b>, but then the topography changes to a 10 degree uphill slope, this change in slope would cause the accelerometer <b>2014</b> to signal that the actuator <b>2050</b> has moved from its commanded position unexpectedly when in reality it is correct, but the topography changed. To avoid such false readings, the signals generated by the accelerometer <b>2014</b> are compared against the signals generated by the accelerometer on the SRM. Thus, as the topography changes, the gravity vector from the SRM changes and this gravity vector can be referenced in relation to the accelerometer <b>2014</b>, to confirm that the actuator <b>2050</b> did not move.</p>
<p id="p-0138" num="0137">Additionally, the current sensors <b>2016</b>, <b>2018</b> can detect if there is a jamming situation in the actuator <b>2050</b> if the current spikes when the depth adjustment body <b>1994</b> is not near either end of travel on the gear rack <b>1910</b> and the Hall effect sensor fails to pick up any pulses indicating that the motor <b>2030</b> has stalled.</p>

As illustrated by dashed lines in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>31</b></figref>, the rotation of the worm gear <b>3032</b> by the motor <b>3030</b> causes the gear wheel <b>3036</b> to rotate due to the engagement of the helical teeth <b>3033</b> with the notches <b>3035</b> of the gear wheel <b>3036</b>. The rotation of the gear wheel <b>3036</b> causes the shaft <b>3038</b> to rotate, which, in turn, pivots the clevis <b>3040</b>. Since the clevis <b>3040</b> is connected to the depth adjustment body <b>3044</b> by the link <b>3042</b>, the depth adjustment body <b>3044</b> is forced to pivot around the pivot <b>92</b>, thereby moving the rocker <b>95</b> as indicated by dashed lines. As previously explained, adjusting the position at which the rocker <b>95</b> engages with the gauge wheel arms <b>54</b> limits the upward movement of the gauge wheel arms <b>54</b>, which, in turn, limits the upward travel of the bottom of the gauge wheels <b>52</b> relative to the bottom of the opening discs <b>62</b>, thereby setting the depth of penetration of the opening discs <b>62</b> into the soil surface and thus, the depth of the seed furrow <b>3</b>.</p>

<p id="p-0153" num="0152">The inductance sensor <b>7000</b> utilizes contactless inductive sensing to measure the position of a conductive target, an example of a commercially available inductance sensor is the LDC<b>131</b><i>x </i>or LDC <b>161</b><i>x </i>inductance sensor available from Texas Instruments. In a preferred embodiment, two inductive sensors <b>7002</b>, <b>7004</b> are secured to a sensor board <b>7006</b> which extends into the gearbox housing <b>3006</b>, <b>4006</b>, <b>5006</b>, <b>6006</b>. The inductive sensors <b>7002</b>, <b>7004</b> comprise coiled copper with ferrite backing for shielding. The sensor board <b>7006</b> is secured to a wall of the gearbox housing <b>3006</b>, <b>4006</b>, <b>5006</b>, <b>6006</b> to ensure repeatable and robust placement of the inductive sensors <b>7002</b>, <b>7004</b> relative to their respective targets <b>7008</b>, <b>7010</b>. The first inductive sensor <b>7002</b> is disposed on the sensor board <b>7006</b> relative to the first target <b>7008</b> which is secured to a stationary wall or surface of the gearbox housing <b>3006</b>, <b>4006</b>, <b>5006</b>, <b>6006</b>. Thus, the first inductive sensor <b>7002</b> with its stationary target <b>7008</b> serves as a reference sensor to detect expansion or contraction of the gearbox housing that may occur due to temperature variations. The detected changes due to expansion or contraction of the gearbox housing may be used to true-up the measurements of the second inductive sensor <b>7004</b>. The second inductive sensor <b>7004</b> is disposed on the sensor board <b>7006</b> in line with the axis of the transverse shaft <b>3038</b>, <b>4038</b>, <b>5038</b>, <b>6038</b> to which the gear wheel <b>3036</b>, <b>4036</b>, <b>5036</b>, <b>6036</b> is rotationally fixed. The gear wheel <b>3036</b>, <b>4026</b>, <b>5036</b>, <b>6036</b> includes a cam <b>7020</b> having a non-concentric or eccentric curved surface <b>7022</b> resulting in an eccentric profile which serves as the second target <b>7010</b> for the second inductive sensor <b>7004</b>. Thus, it should be appreciated that as transverse shaft <b>3038</b>, <b>4038</b>, <b>5038</b>, <b>6038</b> is caused to rotate due to engagement of the gear wheel <b>3036</b>, <b>4036</b>, <b>5036</b>, <b>6036</b> with the rotating worm gear <b>3032</b>, <b>4032</b>, <b>5032</b>, <b>6032</b> rotated by the motor <b>3030</b>, <b>4030</b>, <b>5030</b>, <b>6030</b>, the relative distance between the second inductive sensor <b>7004</b> and the eccentric profile of the second target <b>7010</b> will vary. This change in relative position of the second target <b>7010</b> with respect to the stationary second inductive sensor <b>7004</b> will thus correspond to the position of the depth adjustment body <b>3044</b>, <b>4044</b>, <b>5044</b>, <b>6044</b>, and thus the position of the gauge wheel arms <b>54</b> which correspond to the depth of penetration of the opening disc <b>62</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0154" num="0153">It should be appreciated that although the use of the reference sensor <b>7002</b> is preferred in order to take into account expansion or contraction of the gearbox housing for purposes of trueing-up the measurements of the second inductance sensor <b>7004</b>, the reference sensor <b>7002</b> may be omitted such that the inductive sensor <b>7000</b> utilizes only one inductive sensor.</p>

<p id="p-0158" num="0157">Another absolute position sensor may be in the form of a magnet and a Hall effect sensor, whereby a change in the magnetic field is detected as one rotates relative to the other.

<p id="p-0167" num="0166">According to some exemplary processes of controlling depth using the depth adjustment assemblies described herein, a user may manually adjust the primary and/or secondary depth adjustment assemblies.</p>
<p id="p-0168" num="0167">According to some exemplary processes, the user may manually adjust the primary depth adjustment assembly and may use the monitor <b>50</b> to command a depth adjustment to the secondary depth adjustment assembly.</p>
<p id="p-0169" num="0168">According to some exemplary processes, the user may manually adjust the primary depth adjustment assembly and the monitor <b>50</b> may command a desired depth adjustment to the secondary depth adjustment assembly (e.g., one of the actuators/motors <b>720</b>, <b>800</b>, <b>950</b>, <b>1000</b>, <b>1230</b>, <b>1450</b>, <b>1550</b>, <b>1650</b>) by receiving one or more agronomic variables from the sensors (e.g., sensors <b>350</b>, <b>355</b>, <b>360</b>, <b>365</b>, <b>352</b>, <b>385</b>) or from the soil data server <b>345</b> and determine a desired depth adjustment by consulting a database or algorithm relating one or more agronomic variables to a desired furrow depth.</p>
<p id="p-0170" num="0169">According to some exemplary processes, the monitor <b>50</b> may command a desired depth adjustment to the depth adjustment assembly <b>1650</b>, <b>1750</b>, <b>1850</b>, <b>1950</b>, <b>1984</b>, <b>2050</b>, <b>3050</b>, <b>4050</b>, <b>5050</b>, <b>6050</b> by receiving one or more agronomic variables from the sensors (e.g., sensors <b>350</b>, <b>355</b>, <b>360</b>, <b>365</b>, <b>352</b>, <b>385</b>) or from the soil data server <b>345</b> and determine a desired depth adjustment by consulting a database or algorithm relating one or more agronomic variables to a desired furrow depth.</p>
<p id="p-0171" num="0170">According to some exemplary processes, the monitor <b>50</b> may command a desired depth adjustment to the depth adjustment assembly <b>1650</b>, <b>1750</b>, <b>1850</b>, <b>1950</b>, <b>1984</b>, <b>2050</b>, <b>3050</b>, <b>4050</b>, <b>5050</b>, <b>6050</b> by determining the GPS-reported location of the row unit <b>10</b> and consulting a depth prescription map spatially relating locations and/or regions in the field to desired furrow depths.</p>
<p id="p-0172" num="0171">Depth prescriptions are based on placing seeds at a proper depth to obtain desired germination and emergence. Factors that are used to determine a proper depth include, but are not limited to, soil type, organic matter content, moisture, soil temperature, soil texture, topography, and elevation. The depth prescription can be based on a combination of current temperature and moisture conditions in the field and the predicted temperature and moisture delivery from a weather forecast. This process is described in U.S. Patent Publication No. 2016/0037709, which is incorporated herein by reference.</p>
<p id="p-0173" num="0172">In another embodiment, a minimum depth and a maximum depth set by an operator may be input into monitor <b>50</b> to control the desired depth within a range specified by the operator. The operator set minimum depth may be greater than the actual minimum depth obtainable by the depth adjustment assembly, and the operator set maximum depth may be less than the actual maximum depth obtainable by the depth adjustment assembly. This can be useful to constrain the depth to a desired depth range. For a given seed type, there can be a desired depth range for planting the seed so that the seed can germinate and emerge. When adjusting the depth based on a measured condition in the field, such as moisture, soil temperature, organic matter content, soil type, or soil texture using a sensor, such as described in U.S. Patent Publication No. US2016/0037709, the sensor may signal a depth change to go to a depth that has the selected soil property, but while trying to change to a depth to achieve the selected property, the depth may be outside of the selected range. Having the operator set minimum and maximum depths keeps the seed in the desired depth range. As an example, an operator may want corn seed to be planted between 1.75&#x2033; and 2.5&#x2033;. If the sensor is measuring for moisture, and the moisture is insufficient at shallower depths, the depth adjustment mechanism would receive a signal to change to a deeper depth, but it can be constrained to stay within the operator selected range.</p>
<p id="p-0174" num="0173">In some embodiments, the monitor <b>50</b> may record changes in depth in the field by associating commanded actuations of the actuator/motor <b>720</b>, <b>800</b>, <b>950</b>, <b>1000</b>, <b>1230</b>, <b>1450</b>, <b>1550</b>, <b>1650</b>, <b>1750</b>/<b>1730</b>, <b>1850</b>/<b>1830</b>, <b>1950</b>/<b>1930</b>, <b>1984</b>, <b>2050</b>/<b>2030</b>, <b>3050</b>/<b>3030</b>, <b>4050</b>/<b>4030</b>, <b>5050</b>/<b>5030</b>, <b>6050</b>/<b>6030</b> with GPS locations reported by the GPS receiver <b>52</b>. In some such embodiments, the monitor <b>50</b> may record a change in depth concurrently with the commanded actuations of the actuator/motor <b>720</b>, <b>800</b>, <b>950</b>, <b>1000</b>, <b>1230</b>, <b>1450</b>, <b>1550</b>, <b>1650</b>, <b>1750</b>/<b>1730</b>, <b>1850</b>/<b>1830</b>, <b>1950</b>/<b>1930</b>, <b>1984</b>, <b>2050</b>/<b>2030</b>, <b>3050</b>/<b>3030</b>, <b>4050</b>/<b>4030</b>, <b>5050</b>/<b>5030</b>, <b>6050</b>/<b>6030</b>. However, in operation, the force between the rocker <b>95</b> and the gauge wheel arm and/or the depth adjustment member may vary, e.g., as the row unit moves across uneven terrain. Thus, in some embodiments, the monitor <b>50</b> may monitor the force on the gauge wheel arm and/or the depth adjustment rocker and record the change in depth only when the force is lower than a predetermined threshold. For example, with respect to the embodiment of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>12</b></figref>, the monitor <b>50</b> may monitor the force on the gauge wheel arm and/or the depth adjustment rocker and record the change in depth only when the force is lower than a predetermined threshold at which the depth adjustment member can be advanced for a given position of the actuator <b>1230</b>. The force on the gauge wheel arm and/or the depth adjustment rocker may be recorded by a load sensor such as a strain gauge mounted to the gauge wheel arm or other location through which the force is transmitted, or by a load sensing pin incorporated in the row unit as is known in the art.</p>
<p id="p-0175" num="0174">In other implementations, the monitor <b>50</b> may command a temporary change (e.g., reduction) in row unit downforce applied by the downforce actuator <b>18</b> concurrently with (or before or after) a commanded change in the extension of the actuator/motor <b>720</b>, <b>800</b>, <b>950</b>, <b>1000</b>, <b>1230</b>, <b>1450</b>, <b>1550</b>, <b>1650</b>, <b>1750</b>/<b>1730</b>, <b>1850</b>/<b>1830</b>, <b>1950</b>/<b>1930</b>, <b>1984</b>, <b>2050</b>/<b>2030</b>, <b>3050</b>/<b>3030</b>, <b>4050</b>/<b>4030</b>, <b>5050</b>/<b>5030</b>, <b>6050</b>/<b>6030</b> in order to permit the depth adjustment. The monitor <b>50</b> may then command the row unit downforce applied by the actuator <b>18</b> to return to its previously commanded level.</p>
