<p id="p-0001" num="0000">The container for cosmetic product, suitable for use on the go, includes a base and a compartment for the product, with an opening surrounded by a peripheral edge which extends radially from a partitioning side wall to a peripheral wall of the base. The lid of the container hermetically covers this opening and is retained when an associated perpendicular rod, traversing the peripheral edge, is in the position of maximum insertion, therefore proximal to a container bottom. A driving force on the outside of the lid makes it possible to overcome the retention, by moving the lid along an inclined upper surface of the peripheral edge, compatible with a rising of the rod which guides the lid displacement that is generally parallel to the opening plane. The container may be part of a cap sealing a packaging assembly of larger volume.</p>

<?summary-of-invention description="Summary of Invention" end="lead"?>
<heading id="h-0001" level="1">FIELD</heading>
<p id="p-0002" num="0001">This disclosure relates to the field of containers for cosmetic products.</p>
<heading id="h-0002" level="1">BACKGROUND</heading>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">A container for cosmetic products and accessories is known from document U.S. Ser. No. 10/398,206, comprising a body intended to receive cosmetic accessories, and a cap comprising several reservoirs intended to receive cosmetic products. The compartments of the cap are interconnected by means of a rod, itself fixed to a spring imposing a downward vertical movement, in order to create vertical tension between the compartments enabling them to remain in an open or closed position. The compartments can be moved between the open and closed position by rotation around the rod, and the lid opens and closes by means of a hinge.</p>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">One of the disadvantages of the cap of this container is that its size due to the opening/closing system is too great. This limits its attraction and, moreover, the cap is not very suitable for use on the go, for example for carrying in a handbag.</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">Another disadvantage lies in the lack of fluidtightness of the cap.</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">There is therefore a need for a fluidtight container for cosmetic product, allowing good preservation of the cosmetic product, and of minimal bulk.</p>
<heading id="h-0003" level="1">SUMMARY</heading>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">In order to improve the situation, a container for cosmetic product is proposed comprising:</p>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">a base comprising a lower surface and a peripheral wall extending from the lower surface and upwards to define an inside volume,</p>
<p id="p-0009" num="0008">a receiving space for the cosmetic product, the receiving space being accessible via an upper opening,</p>
<p id="p-0010" num="0009">a peripheral edge, the upper opening being surrounded by the peripheral edge,</p>
<p id="p-0011" num="0010">a lid, movable relative to the base and to the peripheral edge between a closed position, in which the lid prevents access to the cosmetic product, and an open position, in which the cosmetic product is accessible via the upper opening;</p>
<p id="p-0012" num="0011">a sealing system preventing the cosmetic product from coming into contact with an external environment when the lid is in the closed position;</p>
<p id="p-0013" num="0012">an opening/closing system, suitable for causing the lid to transition between the open position and the closed position, comprising a rod located at the rear of the lid and housed (received) in a hole of the peripheral edge, the rod cooperating with the lid and extending from the lid towards the lower surface of the base while being configured to move transversely relative to the lower surface of the base in order to transition between a position (rod position) proximal to the lower surface and a position (rod position) distal to the lower surface;</p>
<p id="p-0014" num="0013">a restraint system forcing the lid to the closed position, for example by urging and/or maintaining (retaining) the rod towards its proximal position, so that the lid cannot transition from the closed position to the open position without a force or thrust being exerted on an exterior portion of the lid forming an outer surface of the container;</p>
<p id="p-0015" num="0014">and wherein, for said proximal position of the rod, the lid rests on an upper surface of the peripheral edge of the insert which has an incline (sloping downwards towards an edge of the upper opening).</p>
<p id="p-0016" num="0015">Typically, the opening/closing system is able to be actuated by a driving force on the lid, preferably a driving force exerted by a finger on the lid, which can allow it to open. A lid actuating portion may be provided in the lid on the front side, opposite the rear region where the rod is connected to the lid.</p>
<p id="p-0017" num="0000">The peripheral edge may be part of an insert mounted in the inside volume. For example, the insert may include a receiving space for cosmetic product and includes the peripheral edge. More generally, an added piece or an insert may be provided to form an upper surface, typically annular, of the container. The insert or similar upper member extends into the inside volume of the container. When an insert is used, it is for example mounted in the inside volume, possibly having a recess to define the receiving space which is accessible via the upper opening surrounded by the peripheral edge.</p>
<p id="p-0018" num="0016">The lid in the closed position is for example embedded in the base and can follow the inclined upper surface as it is closed/embedded. The lid is able to slide along the incline of the upper surface so as to cause a transverse displacement (lowering) of the rod from and/or to its proximal position.</p>
<p id="p-0019" num="0017">Where appropriate, the opening/closing system does not have a lock, the restraint system including a return member urging the rod towards its proximal position (downwards/towards the bottom of the base) and which is the only member of the container to exert an axial retention action, parallel to the rod. Alternatively, the opening/closing system may include a locking member with the effect of axial retention on/against the peripheral edge.</p>
<p id="p-0020" num="0018">A locking member as mentioned above may be located, for example, on the front of the lid (opposite to where the rod meets the closure portion of the lid). Such a locking member may optionally be hidden within the inside volume in the closed position, and is typically operable in response to a driving force or action exerted on the lid in order to allow the lid to be locked/unlocked. The locking member may be elastically deformable in order to engage with a gripping edge or rim of the peripheral edge, optionally movable in response to an axial or lateral driving force on an operable portion of the lid in order to be disengaged from the gripping edge or rim.</p>
<p id="p-0021" num="0019">The upper surface of the peripheral edge may extend entirely above a plane of the opening providing access to the inside space/compartment (partitioned or not) where one or more products are housed.</p>
<p id="p-0022" num="0020">In the closed position, the rod can be completely hidden, forming an internal rod. It is then possible to hide the mechanism locking the closed position, which reduces the risk of external damage to this mechanism.</p>
<p id="p-0023" num="0021">With this arrangement, it is possible to have an ergonomic lid, establishing an annular seal with typically a locking of the lid's position at the rod which is typically hidden, which makes it possible, for example, to refine the exterior geometry of the container or at least to have flexibility in the external decorative covering over the periphery of the container.</p>
<p id="p-0024" num="0022">In some embodiments, in the closed position, an inner surface of a peripheral end of the lid, in the contact portion, rests on an upper surface of the peripheral edge of the insert, with the knowledge that the inner surface of the peripheral end of the lid and the upper surface of the peripheral edge of the insert have an incline (for example at the same angle relative to a plane of extension of the lid), such that the driving force (on the lid) is able to cause a translational movement of the lid induced by a sliding between the respective inclines of the inner surface of the peripheral end of the lid and of the peripheral edge of the insert, causing transverse displacement of the rod relative to the lower surface of the base, to move the rod from the proximal position to a position distal from the lower surface, and thereby causing the lid to transition from the closed position to the open position.</p>
<p id="p-0025" num="0023">The lid extends perpendicularly to the central axis of the side wall of the insert or to the axis of the rod, preferably along a plane, this plane possibly being defined by the outer face of the lid.</p>
<p id="p-0026" num="0024">An angle of incline of the peripheral edge is provided which is for example less than or equal to 45 or 60&#xb0;, relative to a plane of the lid, preferably less than 30 or 40&#xb0;. This angle of incline can define a constant slope in the peripheral edge, spread over 360&#xb0;. Alternatively, such an angle of incline corresponds to a maximum slope.</p>
<p id="p-0027" num="0025">In some options, the following are formed relative to a plane of the top of the base, corresponding to an opening or upper side through which the insert is mounted in the base:</p>
<p id="p-0028" num="0026">a first angle, by the upper surface of the peripheral edge, this first angle possibly being between 5 and 50&#xb0;; and</p>
<p id="p-0029" num="0027">a second angle, by the peripheral end of the lid constituting the contact portion with the peripheral edge, this second angle possibly being between 5 and 50&#xb0;. Optionally, these two angles are substantially complementary. In addition, the plane of extension of the lid is typically parallel to the plane of the top of the base which is defined by the top of the peripheral wall.</p>
<p id="p-0030" num="0028">The incline of the upper surface of the peripheral edge may have a curvature as can be seen in a longitudinal profile, which creates a concave profile on the interior side, delimiting the access to the inside space/compartment for cosmetic product. A similar curvature is for example provided on the inside of the lid, i.e. on the contact portion side of the lid.</p>
<p id="p-0031" num="0029">The peripheral edge may be part of an insert, including the receiving space. The insert has an annular side wall that extends around a central axis. Optionally, the lid is carried by a rod defining an axis substantially parallel to the central axis, which is for example a rod that is internal/not visible (from the outside of the container) in the closed position. The hole, formed in the peripheral edge and traversed by the rod, may be:</p>
<p id="p-0032" num="0030">offset, upward or possibly downward, relative to an annular sealed contact area (lid&#x2014;peripheral edge) established by the sealing system;</p>
<p id="p-0033" num="0031">and/or radially interposed between a first sloping portion, in the upper surface of the peripheral edge, which is adjacent to an internal annular edge defining the upper opening, and a second sloping portion, formed in the upper surface of the peripheral edge, extending to an annular end of the upper surface of the peripheral edge which constitutes an outer circumference of the peripheral edge (and typically an outer circumference of the insert).</p>
<p id="p-0034" num="0032">According to one feature, the rod is configured for:</p>
<p id="p-0035" num="0033">pulling (traction from below) and adjusting the height of a closure portion which is part of the lid and which completely covers the upper opening in the closed position, the closure portion fitting into the base by being housed within the inside volume when the rod is in the proximal position; and</p>
<p id="p-0036" num="0034">protruding axially above the peripheral edge when the rod is in the distal position, while enabling the rear of the lid to be movable above the peripheral wall.</p>
<p id="p-0037" num="0035">Typically, the base may be an outer decorative casing. In some options, only the base and a top portion of the lid are visible (forming the outer decorative portion), in the closed position/configuration of the container. The insert can then be completely hidden.</p>
<p id="p-0038" num="0036">In the peripheral edge defining the upper opening of the container, the incline or slope of the upper surface may be provided on each side of a plane of symmetry parallel to the rod, and is directed from the front towards the back of the lid. A return force permitted by the restraint system can be exerted to facilitate the return and/or the retention in the closed position. Thus, a user who actuates the lid, for example in a rotation, to move the front of the lid to the right or to the left until reaching or passing (axially) beyond the top of the peripheral wall of the base while sliding up the slope of the upper surface, overcomes a force (typically a return force) exerted by the restraint system but benefits from a sliding effect due to the incline. This actuation may further be facilitated by occurring at the front, therefore at a distance from the axis of the rod which is located at the rear of the lid.</p>
<p id="p-0039" num="0037">It is understood that the lid which slides to one side (to the left from the front for example) in order to ascend the slope will also be lifted at the rear (and towards the left) because of the guidance by the slope. Typically, if a return force is exerted at the rod, the return effect ceases to be felt/is no longer maintained once the lid has crossed a displacement threshold corresponding to passing beyond a slope: the closure portion of the lid in fact abuts axially against the top of the peripheral wall. Conversely, the return effect facilitates the positioning (in the manner of fine tuning after a first approximate angular displacement) of the lid in its final closed position once the lid has come close enough to its final position (combined return effects by the restraint system and by the downward slope to slide the lid towards the hermetically sealed position).</p>
<p id="p-0040" num="0038">In some options, the return effect is eliminated and a simple locking of the closed position of the lid by an axial retention effect (peripheral edge&#x2014;closure portion of the lid) is provided, for example obtained by an elastically deformable member, which allows easy unlocking by pushing on an accessible portion of the lid.</p>
<p id="p-0041" num="0039">Optionally, one or more of the following arrangements is provided:</p>
<p id="p-0042" num="0040">in the closed position (with the lid at least partially inserted into the inside volume of the base), an inner surface of a peripheral end of the lid rests on the upper surface of the peripheral edge.</p>
<p id="p-0043" num="0041">the inner surface of the peripheral end of the lid and the upper surface of the peripheral edge have a substantially identical incline.</p>
<p id="p-0044" num="0042">the lid has a closure portion configured to move, in response to the driving force exerted on the outer portion of the lid in the closed position, in a translational movement induced by a sliding between said respective inclines of the inner surface of the peripheral end of the lid and of the upper surface of the peripheral edge, until reaching a raised position resulting in a movement of the rod causing the rod to transition from the proximal position to the distal position.</p>
<p id="p-0045" num="0043">the movement of the rod corresponds to a movement parallel to the general direction of insertion or of embedding of the lid within the inside volume of the base, and/or to a transverse movement relative to the lower surface of the base, and thus causing the lid to transition between the open position and the closed position.</p>
<p id="p-0046" num="0044">the insert has a side wall defining the receiving space (which is made accessible only when the lid leaves its closed position).</p>
<p id="p-0047" num="0045">the side wall extends annularly around a central axis, joining the peripheral edge at an annular upper axial end which is opposite to the lower surface.</p>
<p id="p-0048" num="0046">the annular upper axial end of the side wall (possibly cylindrical wall, optionally annular and continuously rounded/curved) defines the upper opening.</p>
<p id="p-0049" num="0047">the upper opening extends entirely within the inside volume.</p>
<p id="p-0050" num="0048">the peripheral edge, which is annular, may have a shape that is generally frustoconical or is a sphere portion bounded by two of its parallels, rising radially outwards from the annular upper axial end towards a top of the peripheral wall.</p>
<p id="p-0051" num="0049">the peripheral edge, which is annular, may be formed as one piece with the peripheral wall (in this case, the base may possibly be open on the lower side and closed off by an added piece forming a bottom of the container). The added piece may be fixed, removable, or optionally movable.</p>
<p id="p-0052" num="0050">According to one feature, the lid includes the rod which defines an axis of rotation of the lid. To transition from the closed position to the open position and vice versa, the closure portion of the lid and the rod (and typically the entire lid) are further able to be rotated about the axis of rotation of the lid by the driving force, exerted at the front of the lid and in a direction transverse to the axis of rotation and which is perpendicular to a straight line (along the plane of the lid) connecting the rear of the lid to the front of the lid. Such a direction can be referred to as a generally tangential (not radial) direction, with the front of the lid typically being a point or region diametrically opposite to the rod. By means of this type of rotational actuation, a rotation is created which induces the sliding of the lid on the inclined upper surface of the peripheral edge.</p>
<p id="p-0053" num="0051">The incline of the upper surface of the peripheral edge does not block this actuation; rather it guides the upward-downward component of the movement, with the knowledge that the lowest position of the lid corresponds to the closed position. The upward sliding on the upper surface may also make it possible to overcome the return force which may be being exerted on the rod (return force for the effect of retention in the closed position), however without exerting axial traction directly opposite to/in the direction opposed to the return force.</p>
<p id="p-0054" num="0052">According to some embodiments, the opening/closing system further comprises a guide region, fixed, formed by a guide (for example included in the insert) having a substantially cylindrical structure which surrounds the rod, the guide region cooperating with an anchoring portion included in or made integral with the rod. Typically, the anchor portion is provided at a lower end of the rod. By means of this coupling/guiding, a controlled axial displacement of the lid is permitted during rotation about the axis of rotation, this axial displacement depending on the movement of the anchoring portion relative to the guide region, preferably the movement of at least one lug (of this anchoring portion or of the guide) within a helical track or groove constituting the complementary portion for the guiding effect.</p>
<p id="p-0055" num="0053">In a sub-option, the helical guiding is made possible by using one or more lugs in an anchoring portion, for example made integral with the rod, the helical track which receives this or these lugs constituting the fixed guide region in the guide. In another sub-option, it is the rod which has a helical track on its outer side face, as a recess or protruding relief, to cooperate with a fixed relief provided in the guide. In the latter case, a lug may be provided, for example located in the fixed guide region formed by the cylindrical structure (structure which may extend under the peripheral edge and within the inside volume of the base, surrounding the rod). The helical track is formed along the rod and, here too, the force or thrust on the lid makes it possible to cause the relative displacement of the helical track (of the rod) with respect to the fixed lug, thus causing said lid to transition between the closed position and the open position with a helical guiding effect.</p>
<p id="p-0056" num="0054">The opening/closing system, with or without helical guiding, may also comprise a spring or other return member, mounted axially between a bottom wall (forming the lower surface) of the base and the rod. The rod may carry a radial portion, which may be the anchoring portion in the case of helical guiding, against which a movable end of the return member comes to rest. The other end of the return member remains fixed and for example directly engaged against the bottom wall of the base.</p>
<p id="p-0057" num="0055">When a spring is provided, it may be compressed in the closed position of the lid, so that the transition from the closed position to the open position is able to cause relaxation of the spring, thus causing the transition from the closed position to the open position automatically.</p>
<p id="p-0058" num="0056">In a typical embodiment, the opening/closing system further comprises a fixed guide region formed by a guide having a substantially cylindrical structure which surrounds the rod. Optionally, the guide region cooperates with an anchoring portion included in or made integral with the rod, at a lower end of the rod, whereby an axial displacement of the lid during rotation about the axis of rotation is dependent on the movement of the anchoring portion relative to the fixed guide region, preferably by using a lug engaged in a helical track.</p>
<p id="p-0059" num="0057">In one option, the rod and the lid are connected by a hinge or similar means enabling the lid <b>5</b> to be tilted, typically without modifying the general direction of extension of the rod mounted through the hole in the peripheral edge. The hinge may be selected among a pin hinge or a ball joint.</p>
<p id="p-0060" num="0058">Additionally or alternatively, the opening/closing system may further comprise a track which is part of the lid and able to cooperate with an upper portion of the rod. Typically, this upper portion and the lower end of the rod are distributed (axially) one on either side of the hole of the peripheral edge. Preferably, the lid is able to transition between the closed position and the open position by means of the driving force, exerted in a radial direction from the front of the lid towards the rear of the lid, thus causing a relative movement, preferably rectilinear, of the track carried by the lid and of the upper portion (which is mounted in or on the track). This upper, external portion may be provided with a lug or rigid male member intended to slide within a groove of the track.</p>
<p id="p-0061" num="0059">In some options, the opening/closing system comprises a return member, formed in/carried by the rod (for example at its lower end) or interposed between the rod and a bottom wall (forming said lower surface) of the base, the return member being configured to urge the lid towards the open position, typically by urging the upper end of the rod into its distal position relative to the bottom wall of the base. Preferably, a locking device is further provided to lock the closed position of the lid, axially blocking this lid (which prevents any raising of the rod). Thus, the action or driving force can simply correspond to an unlocking, and the opening of the lid is immediately facilitated by the effect of the return force which raises or deploys the rod (higher), for example under the effect of the release of a spring. During a rotational movement exerted for example at the front of the lid, the rod is no longer immobilized/retracted by the action of the locking device, so that the return member causes the lid to rise and thus automatically causes the transition from the closed position to the open position.</p>
<p id="p-0062" num="0060">In one embodiment, the locking device may include:</p>
<p id="p-0063" num="0061">a retainer, preferably in the form of a clip or insertion tab, formed in the lid, in or adjacent to a contact portion for contact of the lid against the peripheral edge; and</p>
<p id="p-0064" num="0062">a complementary attachment member, preferably in the form of a gripping edge, under which the retainer is removably engaged in the closed position.</p>
<p id="p-0065" num="0063">In some embodiments of the container, one or more of the following arrangements are provided:</p>
<p id="p-0066" num="0064">the lid forms a push button integral in rotation with the rod, the rod defining an axis of rotation of the lid (for a movement of the lid around the rod).</p>
<p id="p-0067" num="0065">the opening/closing system comprises a guide, preferably cylindrical, surrounding and guiding the rod, as well as two return members able to exert an axial driving force in the same direction and orientation.</p>
<p id="p-0068" num="0066">a first return member is provided, mounted in a recess of the guide to urge a raising of the lid via the rod, and a second return member is provided, mounted in a cavity of the base.</p>
<p id="p-0069" num="0067">the second return member has a contracted (or flattened/compressed) configuration to allow downward axial movement of the insert in response to an inward driving force on the lid exerted axially on the lid from above, and a deployed configuration to raise the insert to a default axial position when said inward driving force ceases.</p>
<p id="p-0070" num="0068">the lid has an annular contact portion for contact of the lid against the peripheral edge, an incline being provided in the contact portion at least at the side where the rotated lid moves away from the upper opening.</p>
<p id="p-0071" num="0069">sliding of the contact portion on the inclined upper surface of the peripheral edge can be induced at said side by a rotation of the lid.</p>
<p id="p-0072" num="0070">the rotation path of the lid is dependent on a substantially helical guiding of the rod, made possible by the coupling of the rod with the guide.</p>
<p id="p-0073" num="0071">the rod has a track (for example gouged into the thickness of the rod) which is formed along the rod, preferably in the form of a groove which extends between an upper end and a lower end (which possibly opens onto the bottom of the rod), supplemented where appropriate by a lug housing in an area adjacent to the upper end.</p>
<p id="p-0074" num="0072">the track is provided with a helical portion in which is engaged a lug formed in a generally cylindrical inner face of the guide, during rotation of the lid.</p>
<p id="p-0075" num="0073">the first return member and the guide cooperate with the rod, when the lug is positioned at an upper end of the helical portion, such that the force exerted by the first return member is exerted at least when the return force of the second return member ceases, to allow the rod to rotate (via the helical guidance) and rise along the guide, thereby rotating the lid.</p>
<p id="p-0076" num="0074">the restraint system comprises the lug which is part of the guide, as well as a housing provided in the continuity of the upper end of the helical portion of the track and forming an elbow bend with said upper end of the helical portion.</p>
<p id="p-0077" num="0075">the lug is received in the housing in the closed position, with the knowledge that under the effect of the driving force compressing the first and second springs constituting the first and second return members, the lug is able to be removed (moved) from the housing and positioned in the helical portion of the track, in particular in its upper portion.</p>
<p id="p-0078" num="0076">the driving force of the rod against the lug(s) can cause rotation (slight rotation) of the guide relative to the base and to the peripheral edge (this edge typically being included in the insert or formed with the peripheral wall of the base).</p>
<p id="p-0079" num="0077">the guide extends under the peripheral edge, between the peripheral edge/insert and the bottom wall of the base.</p>
<p id="p-0080" num="0078">the first spring or return member is located between a lower end of the rod and the bottom wall of the base.</p>
<p id="p-0081" num="0079">the second spring or return member is located axially between the receiving space for cosmetic product and the bottom wall of the base.</p>
<p id="p-0082" num="0080">the lid can transition from the closed position to the open position after the driving force (inward driving force) is exerted downwards on the lid then released, the driving force being able to compress the first spring and the second spring.</p>
<p id="p-0083" num="0081">the lid and the rod are also able to be rotated, automatically, by a relaxation of the first and second springs causing a relative displacement of the track of the rod (in particular the helical portion of this track) with respect to the lug received in path/guide region of the track.</p>
<p id="p-0084" num="0082">Optionally, the restraint system comprises two complementary members, one distributed in the lid and the other in the insert, the two complementary members being configured in the closed position so that they face each other and/or cooperate mechanically, enabling the locking of the closed position. The complementary members are mechanical and/or magnetic attachment members. These complementary members which ensure this locking are preferably hidden under a visible outer face of the lid.</p>
<p id="p-0085" num="0083">It is possible that the two complementary members comprise at least one protuberance formed on the peripheral end of the lid or on the peripheral edge of the insert, optionally on the front side, the protuberance coupling respectively with a corresponding cavity, possibly complementary in shape, on the peripheral edge or on the peripheral end of the lid.</p>
<p id="p-0086" num="0084">In one option, the restraint system comprises magnetic members having an attraction effect which keeps the lid closed. These magnetic members comprise at least one magnet and a complementary ferrous material. Typically, the container can include one magnet in the peripheral end of the lid and another magnet in the peripheral edge. The two magnets can be positioned so that their opposite magnetic faces are facing each other in the closed position.</p>
<p id="p-0087" num="0085">The features set forth in the following paragraphs may optionally be implemented. They may be implemented independently of one another or in combination with one another:</p>
<p id="p-0088" num="0086">the restraint system includes an elastic return member, preferably in the form of a spring which is compressed when the rod is in the distal position.</p>
<p id="p-0089" num="0087">the elastic return member has a first fixed end in axial abutment under the peripheral edge and a second movable end that is integral with the rod, optionally attached or engaged in abutment against a ring or annular retaining portion, this annular part being fixedly attached to the rod or incorporated in the rod.</p>
<p id="p-0090" num="0088">the insert is created as one piece.</p>
<p id="p-0091" num="0089">the peripheral edge constitutes a flange of the insert.</p>
<p id="p-0092" num="0090">the insert is rigidly fixed to the base, preferably by elastic interlocking, for example by using axial retaining tabs formed to project from a bottom wall including the lower surface of the base.</p>
<p id="p-0093" num="0091">the base is created as one piece.</p>
<p id="p-0094" num="0092">the opening/closing system comprises a guide region formed in a guide, for example of cylindrical structure, interposed and/or extending between the insert and the base and surrounding the rod. Such a guide may be interposed between the insert and the base.</p>
<p id="p-0095" num="0093">a lower end of the rod comprises a flat ring or similar retaining portion (for example a ring of diameter substantially equal to an inside diameter of the cylindrical structure of the guide), so that when transitioning between the open position and the closed position, the lid is able to remain substantially parallel to the lower surface of the base.</p>
<p id="p-0096" num="0094">the cylindrical structure is divided into two guide regions: a first guide region of cylindrical structure extending (downwards) from the peripheral edge of the insert, and a second guide region of cylindrical structure extending (upwards/in the opposite direction) from the bottom portion forming the lower surface of the base.</p>
<p id="p-0097" num="0095">the first and second guide regions surround the rod by fitting one region into the other with at least one radial contact between them.</p>
<p id="p-0098" num="0096">In some embodiments the lid may be hermetically sealed by a sealing system having one or more of the following arrangements:</p>
<p id="p-0099" num="0097">in the closed position, the sealing system is formed by the peripheral edge of the lid bearing down on a rigid retaining ring of the insert, the bearing or contact force being exerted by/from the restraint system: a/at the end (low end) near the base; b/at the end (high end near the space/compartment for product).</p>
<p id="p-0100" num="0098">in the closed position, the sealing system includes or is formed by the peripheral edge of the lid bearing down on a rigid retaining ring of the insert, a tensile force being for example exerted by the restraint system at the end near the base, or alternatively a restraining force is exerted at the end near the space/compartment for product.</p>
<p id="p-0101" num="0099">maintaining the lid in the closed position is made possible by the restraint system.</p>
<p id="p-0102" num="0100">in the closed position, the sealing system includes or is formed by the peripheral end of the lid bearing down on the peripheral edge of the insert.</p>
<p id="p-0103" num="0101">in the closed position, the sealing system includes or is formed by the peripheral end of the lid bearing down on a retaining ring of a pan comprising the cosmetic product and housed in the space of the insert.</p>
<p id="p-0104" num="0102">in the closed position, the sealing system includes or is formed by the peripheral end of the lid bearing down on an elastomer retaining ring molded over the insert.</p>
<p id="p-0105" num="0103">in the closed position, the sealing system includes or is formed by the peripheral end of the lid bearing down on an elastomer retaining ring attached to the insert.</p>
<p id="p-0106" num="0104">in the closed position, the sealing system includes or is formed by the peripheral end of the lid bearing down on an elastomer cone (or truncated cone) formed on the peripheral edge of the insert.</p>
<p id="p-0107" num="0105">According to one feature, a cone or truncated cone of elastomer is provided, formed on the peripheral edge of the insert, for example in the form of an added piece.</p>
<p id="p-0108" num="0106">According to another aspect, it is proposed to use the container within a more voluminous packaging assembly, the container being detachable from the rest of the packaging assembly. The container can thus be separated for use on the go, as it takes up less space (easier to fit in a handbag for example).</p>
<p id="p-0109" num="0107">To this end, it is proposed that the container, which is preferably of generally cylindrical shape and typically wider than high, be used as an integral part of a cap closing off an opening of a receptacle for cosmetic product. The container can form the entire cap.</p>

<heading id="h-0005" level="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION</heading>
<p id="p-0156" num="0154">Several examples of non-limiting embodiments are set forth in detail below. In the various figures, identical references indicate identical or similar elements. Certain references shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>1</b>A through <b>1</b>D</figref> have been omitted in subsequent figures for ease of illustration.</p>
<p id="p-0157" num="0155">As illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>1</b>A to <b>9</b>F</figref>, container <b>1</b> for cosmetic product <b>41</b> comprises a base <b>2</b> provided with a lower surface <b>21</b>, for example created in a bottom wall P<b>2</b>, and a peripheral wall <b>22</b> extending upwards from the lower surface <b>21</b> or at least from the bottom wall. Base <b>2</b> thus defines an inside volume V and may correspond to decorative packaging, here a single part.</p>
<p id="p-0158" num="0156">Container <b>1</b> further comprises an insert <b>3</b>, mounted within peripheral wall <b>22</b> of base <b>2</b>, i.e. typically being surrounded by peripheral wall <b>22</b>. Insert <b>3</b> may be mounted from above, i.e. opposite to lower surface <b>21</b>. In certain variants, container <b>1</b> may have no insert that is mounted opposite to lower surface <b>21</b>. In this latter case, peripheral wall <b>22</b> may be extended by a peripheral edge <b>32</b> forming an annular upper surface.</p>
<p id="p-0159" num="0157">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>1</b>A and <b>1</b>B</figref>, insert <b>3</b> may have a side wall <b>3</b><i>a </i>defining a receiving space <b>31</b>. Side wall <b>3</b><i>a </i>here extends annularly around a central axis Z<b>1</b>, typically while joining a peripheral edge <b>32</b> of insert <b>3</b>. Side wall <b>3</b><i>a </i>may be tubular, presenting an annular upper axial end <b>3</b><i>b </i>which connects with peripheral edge <b>32</b> (angled connection as seen in profile/in any axial section view parallel to central axis Z<b>1</b>). This type of arrangement of insert <b>3</b> can be adopted independently of the method for mounting or moving lid <b>5</b> which will be described further below.</p>
<p id="p-0160" num="0158">Annular upper axial end <b>3</b><i>b</i>, formed opposite to lower surface <b>21</b>, defines upper opening O, preferably such that upper opening O extends entirely within the inside volume V (below the level of the top of peripheral wall <b>22</b>). As will be described in connection with various embodiments of container <b>1</b>, an incline may be provided in an upper surface S<b>32</b> of peripheral edge <b>32</b>, which contributes to allowing an embedding (complete or partial) of a lid <b>5</b> coupled/associated with insert <b>3</b>, preferably undetachably or at least without the possibility of losing lid <b>5</b>. More broadly, a lid <b>5</b> may be coupled/associated with peripheral edge <b>32</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0161" num="0159">Here, as can be seen for example in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>1</b>A to <b>1</b>D</figref> and also in most of the other figures showing insert <b>3</b>, annular peripheral edge <b>32</b> has a shape in the radially outward direction that is generally frustoconical or a sphere portion bounded by two of its parallels. In some options, it is only the top of peripheral edge <b>32</b>, namely the portion forming upper surface S<b>32</b>, which has this type of geometry. This geometry of a generally frustoconical shape may also be adopted in variants where edge <b>32</b> is part of the base, by extending the top of peripheral wall <b>22</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0162" num="0160">With this arrangement of the top of peripheral edge <b>32</b>, upper surface S<b>32</b> rises radially outwards, from annular upper axial end <b>3</b><i>b</i>, towards the top of peripheral wall <b>22</b>. In insert <b>3</b> or more generally in any suitable receiving portion, a receiving space <b>31</b> or at least one compartment is provided, in which cosmetic product <b>41</b> can be placed. Insert <b>3</b> thus typically provides a cavity defining the receiving space <b>31</b>, accessible by an upper opening O. In this non-limiting example, insert <b>3</b> comprises one or more parts separate from base <b>2</b> and extends internally within the inside volume V: it is not part of the decorative packaging (external covering) of container <b>1</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0163" num="0161">Upper opening O is surrounded and here defined by peripheral edge <b>32</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0164" num="0162">Cosmetic product <b>41</b> may be comprised in a pan <b>4</b> received in receiving space <b>31</b>, possibly by being fixed/removably mounted therein, so as to be able to exit receiving space <b>31</b> via upper opening O.</p>
<p id="p-0165" num="0163">Parts <b>3</b><i>a </i>and <b>32</b>, contiguous at end <b>3</b><i>b </i>which here forms their annular connection, may belong to a same part or may form a peripheral wall which surrounds receiving space <b>31</b> and which comes into contact with peripheral wall <b>22</b> of the base. Here peripheral edge <b>32</b> is engaged radially, via an outer lateral surface, against the inner face of peripheral wall <b>22</b>. Peripheral edge <b>32</b> can block off the space/annular access from above between annular end <b>3</b><i>b </i>and the top of peripheral wall <b>22</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0166" num="0164">Container <b>1</b> also comprises the lid <b>5</b>, which is movable relative to base <b>2</b> and to peripheral edge <b>32</b>, between a closed position in which the lid <b>5</b> prevents access to cosmetic product <b>41</b>, and an open position in which the cosmetic product <b>41</b> is accessible. When insert <b>3</b> is provided, the lid <b>5</b> is movable relative to the insert <b>3</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0167" num="0165">In the non-limiting embodiments illustrated in the figures, container <b>1</b> is, in the closed position, of generally tubular shape, for example cylindrical. Optionally, lower surface <b>21</b> of base <b>2</b> as well as lid <b>5</b> may be of circular shape.</p>
<p id="p-0168" num="0166">The figures are purely illustrative and other shapes may be provided. In particular, lower surface <b>21</b> of base <b>2</b> as well as lid <b>5</b> could be square in shape, so that container <b>1</b> in the closed position would have the general shape of a cube. In another embodiment, lower surface <b>21</b> of base <b>2</b> as well as lid <b>5</b> could be of triangular shape, so that container <b>1</b> in the closed position would have the general shape of a triangular prism. Rounded forms and/or elongations (oblong, elliptical cross-section) may also be provided.</p>
<p id="p-0169" num="0167">When container <b>1</b> is in the closed position as in the case of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>1</b>A, <b>2</b>A, <b>3</b>A, <b>4</b>A, <b>5</b>A, <b>5</b>C, <b>6</b>A, <b>7</b>A, <b>7</b>C, <b>8</b>A, <b>9</b>A, <b>10</b> to <b>13</b>, and <b>19</b></figref>, peripheral end <b>51</b> of the lid <b>5</b> rests on upper surface S<b>32</b> of the peripheral edge <b>32</b> of insert <b>3</b>. Here, an inner surface (not visible in the closed position of lid <b>5</b>) of peripheral end <b>51</b> can engage against insert <b>3</b>, for example by forming an annular axial contact against upper surface S<b>32</b>. In this configuration, the lid <b>5</b> may be substantially flush with peripheral edge <b>32</b> of base <b>2</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0170" num="0168">The lid <b>5</b> of the container <b>1</b> covers opening O, here hermetically, and is kept closed when an associated perpendicular rod <b>61</b>, traversing (axially) the peripheral edge <b>32</b>, is in the position of maximum insertion, therefore proximal relative to bottom wall P<b>2</b> of the container. As will be described further below, a driving force on the outside of lid <b>5</b> allows overcoming a load or lock, moving lid <b>5</b> typically along/against inclined upper surface S<b>32</b> of the edge (at least at the beginning of the movement), the incline of surface S<b>32</b> being compatible with/facilitating the return of the rod which guides the movement of the lid, this movement then possibly being generally parallel to the plane of opening O.</p>
<p id="p-0171" num="0169">Contact portion PC of lid <b>5</b>, for contact against surface S<b>32</b>, may have the general shape of an annular projection, protruding relative to a more central region of lid <b>5</b> traversed by central axis Z<b>1</b> in the closed position. Lid <b>5</b> may optionally have the maximum thickness, measured parallel to central axis Z<b>1</b> in the closed position, at such a projection, the rest of lid <b>5</b> being comparatively thinner. This projection of contact portion PC may surround an interior depression of lid <b>5</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0172" num="0170">As can be seen in particular in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>1</b>A to <b>9</b>F</figref>, peripheral edge <b>32</b> of insert <b>3</b> and peripheral end <b>51</b> of the lid have an incline on their opposing surfaces, which may each be of annular shape.</p>
<p id="p-0173" num="0171">In the examples illustrated, the incline is planar/regular. However, in other options, the incline may be curved.</p>
<p id="p-0174" num="0172">According to one embodiment, upper surface S<b>32</b> of peripheral edge <b>32</b> of insert <b>3</b> and the corresponding counter-surface (inner surface) of peripheral end <b>51</b> of the lid <b>5</b> are inclined relative to peripheral wall <b>22</b> of base <b>2</b>, preferably at an acute angle.</p>
<p id="p-0175" num="0173">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>1</b>A and <b>1</b>B</figref> for example, it can be seen that base <b>2</b> has a horizontal bottom wall P<b>2</b>, perpendicular to central axis Z<b>1</b>, while surface S<b>32</b> of edge <b>32</b> rises outwards with a slope corresponding to an angle &#x3b4; (theta) which may be less than 60&#xb0;, for example between 4 or 5&#xb0; and 50&#xb0;, more preferably between 9 or 10&#xb0; and approximately 45&#xb0;. Here, this angle &#x3b4; is measured relative to the plane of upper opening O, which can be a plane that is typically horizontal when container <b>1</b> rests on base <b>2</b> in a stable manner.</p>
<p id="p-0176" num="0174">Optionally, lid <b>5</b> may extend generally parallel to a plane, and furthermore may taper as one approaches its outer circumferential edge or similar outer lateral periphery, thus forming an angle in the inner surface of lid <b>5</b>. This angle may be the same as angle &#x3b4; defining the slope of upper surface S<b>32</b>. This thus results in a complementarity compatible with an embedding of contact portion PC of lid <b>5</b> within inside volume V, and facilitating the establishing of an annular axial sealed contact between lid <b>5</b> and upper surface S<b>32</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0177" num="0175">According to one embodiment, in the closed position, the incline of upper surface S<b>32</b> of peripheral edge <b>32</b> and that of the inner surface of peripheral end <b>51</b> of lid <b>5</b> are provided such that the slope angle is substantially the same.</p>
<p id="p-0178" num="0176">According to one example, peripheral end <b>51</b> of lid <b>5</b> has a wider cross-section than the cross-section of upper opening O delimited by upper end <b>3</b><i>b</i>. This wider cross-section allows peripheral end <b>51</b> of lid <b>5</b> to come into contact (annular) against upper surface S<b>32</b> (of rising incline) of peripheral edge <b>32</b>, in the closed position of lid <b>5</b>. Conversely, portion PC of lid <b>5</b> which has a downward incline may be dimensioned so as to have an external cross-section which does not project radially beyond the top of peripheral wall <b>22</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0179" num="0177">Optionally, lid <b>5</b> may be thickened at its periphery, optionally only at its periphery to form the projection constituting contact portion PC. This example is not limiting, and other configurations are possible. For example, the cross-section of lid <b>5</b> at peripheral end <b>51</b> could be finer/thinner than the rest of lid <b>5</b>, which offers the advantage of using less material.</p>
<p id="p-0180" num="0178">Similarly, angle &#x3b4; for the incline of upper surface S<b>32</b> and/or the angle at the intersection of peripheral edge <b>32</b> with the top of peripheral wall <b>22</b>, as can be seen in the figures, are illustrative, and adaptations to the angle or to the manner of fitting lid <b>5</b> on upper surface S<b>32</b> are possible without fundamentally modifying the manner of obtaining the closing and opening.</p>
<p id="p-0181" num="0179">Container <b>1</b> may also comprise a sealing system preventing cosmetic product <b>41</b> from coming into contact with an external environment when lid <b>5</b> is in the closed position. In the illustrated embodiments, container <b>1</b> includes a system for opening/closing lid <b>5</b>, as well as a restraint system which holds lid <b>5</b> in the closed position. Here, a pan <b>4</b> gripping system is provided for removing pan <b>4</b> from insert <b>3</b> in order to allow container <b>1</b> to be refilled with cosmetic product <b>41</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0182" num="0180">In general, the opening/closing system is capable of causing lid <b>5</b> to transition between the open position and the closed position. This expression is understood to mean the transition of lid <b>5</b> from the closed position to the open position and/or the transition of lid <b>5</b> from the open position to the closed position. The expression &#x201c;between the closed position and the open position&#x201d; may also be used with the same meaning.</p>
<p id="p-0183" num="0181">The opening/closing system comprises a rod <b>61</b>, placed at a rear of lid <b>5</b> and typically extending parallel to central axis Z<b>1</b>. In the various figures, central axis Z<b>1</b> is a vertical axis corresponding to a heightwise direction of longitudinal extension (Z). The cross-section of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>1</b>A and <b>1</b>B</figref> for example is made along the main or central plane (XZ) passing through rod <b>61</b>. In non-limiting cases, the position of the rod makes it possible to define two halves, possibly identical, distributed one on either side of main plane (XZ).</p>
<p id="p-0184" num="0182">Lid <b>5</b> may be flat, extending parallel to plane (XY) as can be seen in particular in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b>C</figref>. Rod <b>61</b>, connected to lid <b>5</b>, may extend along axis Z<b>1</b>, parallel to direction (Z), therefore perpendicular to plane (XY). Furthermore, the aforementioned angle &#x3b4; can be measured at the top of peripheral wall <b>22</b>, here with reference to direction X<b>1</b> (along the direction of radial extension (X)) which is a direction of plane (XZ) at which the top or outside face of lid <b>5</b> is typically flush with the top of peripheral wall <b>22</b>. External portion PE of lid <b>5</b> may be substantially flat or parallel to direction X<b>1</b> and perpendicular to the direction of extension or axis Z<b>2</b> of rod <b>61</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0185" num="0183">In some options, the incline in surface S<b>32</b> of peripheral edge <b>32</b> is distributed in two opposite angular sectors which are traversed by the axis of direction X<b>1</b>. The other complementary portions of upper surface S<b>32</b> may not be inclined in some options.</p>
<p id="p-0186" num="0184">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b>B or <b>3</b>B</figref> in particular, rod <b>61</b> is mounted on insert <b>3</b> by traversing peripheral edge <b>32</b> via a hole <b>69</b>. Rod <b>61</b> can thus be housed and arranged within a radial spacing between peripheral wall <b>22</b> of base <b>2</b> and side wall <b>3</b><i>a </i>of insert <b>3</b>. It thus does not interfere with inside space <b>31</b> and can be completely hidden, at least in the closed position of lid <b>5</b>. Rod <b>61</b> thus mounted in hole <b>69</b> of peripheral edge <b>32</b> has an upper portion or rod head which protrudes axially beyond the peripheral edge to enable the rod-lid connection. The connection may be fixed/rigid. More generally, rod <b>61</b> is capable of cooperating with lid <b>5</b> and guiding the movement of the lid when it is opened and when it is closed. Advantageously, rod <b>61</b> extends from lid <b>5</b>, here contact portion PC, by traversing peripheral edge <b>32</b>. Rod <b>61</b> occupies hole <b>69</b> of insert <b>3</b> and extends towards lower surface <b>21</b> of base <b>2</b>. In one configuration, rod <b>61</b> may extend from lid <b>5</b> all the way to or adjacent to lower surface <b>21</b> of base <b>2</b>, when container <b>1</b> is in the closed position.</p>
<p id="p-0187" num="0185">The opening/closing system is capable of being actuated by a driving force from lid <b>5</b>. Advantageously, the driving force is exerted by a finger on lid <b>5</b>. In one configuration, the driving force of the finger is exerted at the front of the lid, i.e. opposite to rod <b>61</b> whose connection to lid <b>5</b> is at the rear of said lid.</p>
<p id="p-0188" num="0186">Advantageously, lid <b>5</b> may have a slightly domed profile, may have a depression (or a geometry with relief(s), with at least one gripping edge), enabling the finger to obtain a grip in order to exert the driving force on lid <b>5</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0189" num="0187">When the driving force is exerted on lid <b>5</b>, the lid <b>5</b> executes a translational movement induced by the sliding of peripheral end <b>51</b> of lid <b>5</b> on upper surface S<b>32</b> of peripheral edge <b>32</b>, due to the angle of incline of upper surface S<b>32</b> and to the similar or identical incline of the inner surface (counter-surface) at peripheral end <b>51</b> of lid <b>5</b> which constitutes contact portion PC. This translational movement also causes a transverse movement of rod <b>61</b> relative to lower surface <b>21</b> of base <b>2</b>, and possibly of insert <b>3</b>, which causes lid <b>5</b> to transition between the open position and the closed position.</p>
<p id="p-0190" num="0188">The driving force overcomes the restraint system, which can then facilitate the movement of rod <b>61</b> which will typically raise lid <b>5</b> possibly with the assistance of a return member and/or with a simple guide coupled to the rod, in preferred embodiments.</p>
<p id="p-0191" num="0189">Various embodiments of container <b>1</b> are more particularly described below. The same reference numbers are used to designate identical elements. Identical elements are not described again.</p>
<p id="p-0192" num="0190">Reference is now made more particularly to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>1</b>A to <b>1</b>D</figref>, illustrating a container <b>1</b> for cosmetic product <b>41</b> according to a first example.</p>
<p id="p-0193" num="0191">In this embodiment, lid <b>5</b> comprises rod <b>61</b> as the axis of rotation, rod <b>61</b> extending linearly along axis Z<b>2</b> parallel to central axis Z<b>1</b>. Thus, when the driving force is exerted, lid <b>5</b>, in addition to the translational movement, performs a rotational movement around rod <b>61</b>. Preferably, the driving force is to be exerted at the front of lid <b>5</b> and in a direction perpendicular to the straight line (X<b>1</b>) connecting the front to the back of lid <b>5</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0194" num="0192">The sliding of peripheral end <b>51</b> of lid <b>5</b> on upper surface S<b>32</b> of peripheral edge <b>32</b>, due to the angle &#x3b4; or common incline between insert <b>3</b> and lid <b>5</b> in this interface zone, can be induced by rotation of lid <b>5</b> around rod <b>61</b>. The user may have a natural rotational movement to accompany lid <b>5</b> in its ascent of the slope formed by upper surface S<b>32</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0195" num="0193">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>1</b>A to <b>6</b>C</figref>, in this type of configuration, rod <b>61</b> and lid <b>5</b> are/belong to one and the same part, so that when transitioning between the closed position and the open position, rod <b>61</b> also rotates about its axis (Z<b>2</b>), in addition to its transverse ascending movement.</p>
<p id="p-0196" num="0194">Furthermore, the opening/closing means may further comprise a guide region, more visible in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b>C</figref>. The guide region is preferably of generally cylindrical or tubular structure and allows defining all or part of a housing for rod <b>61</b> and for a return member such as a spring <b>71</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0197" num="0195">In one configuration, the guide region may be obtained by using a cylindrical structure <b>62</b>, tubular, or a semi-cylindrical/semi-tubular structure such as one comprising two arcuate walls facing each other and defining the contours of a cylinder. Insert <b>3</b> and base <b>2</b> may be connected with a rotation-preventing effect by a coupling providing a guiding effect, with no rotation permitted between these two components <b>2</b>, <b>3</b> around axis Z<b>1</b>, due to a nesting established off-center.</p>
<p id="p-0198" num="0196">Cylindrical structure <b>62</b> forming part of the connector is for example located between insert <b>3</b> (or any suitable partitioning wall for housing the pan) and peripheral wall <b>22</b> of base <b>2</b>, and surrounds the rod <b>61</b>. A portion <b>66</b> of insert <b>3</b> may engage&#x2014;for instance with axial insertion&#x2014;in structure <b>62</b>, which allows rotational indexing. This can also allow ensuring the correct assembly of the insert <b>3</b> or similar upper part forming the upper peripheral edge <b>32</b>, with no unwanted angular discrepancy.</p>
<p id="p-0199" num="0197">In the example illustrated, and as can be seen in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>1</b>C and <b>1</b>D</figref>, such a connector is distributed into two areas, comprising a first guide region in the form of cylindrical structure <b>62</b>, which here is fixed and integral with base <b>22</b>, and a second guide region in the form of portion/guide <b>66</b> running along the first guide region. The first guide region forms a female part for receiving, by interlocking or similar insertion, portion <b>66</b> shaped as tabs or an anchoring projection, integrally formed with peripheral edge <b>32</b> of insert <b>3</b> (on the side opposite to upper surface S<b>32</b>).</p>
<p id="p-0200" num="0198">This example is not limiting and the two guide regions <b>62</b>, <b>66</b> may be made differently. Any positioning means comparable to portion <b>66</b> with a rotation-preventing effect for the insert and able to surround rod <b>61</b> in order to guide said rod, preferably provided in insert <b>3</b>, may be used. In some variants, the rotation-preventing engagement of insert <b>3</b> may be established elsewhere for the fixed assembly within inside volume V of base <b>2</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0201" num="0199">Here, a structure or first guide region <b>62</b> has been shown which is part of insert <b>3</b> and is formed by a structure with a substantially circular cross-section or with circular segments, extending down from peripheral edge <b>32</b> of insert <b>3</b>. The second guide region is implemented in portion <b>66</b> which projects upwards at the bottom wall of base <b>2</b> (and which may be formed by a substantially circular structure). In one configuration, at least one centering contact is obtained for example at the lower end of portions <b>66</b>. Advantageously, guide regions <b>62</b>, <b>66</b> surround rod <b>61</b> while leaving space for a return member (here a spring <b>71</b>) which is placed between one of portions <b>62</b>, <b>66</b> and rod <b>61</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0202" num="0200">Guide regions <b>62</b>, <b>66</b> may be added pieces that are respectively fixed by any suitable means to insert <b>3</b> and to base <b>2</b>. Alternatively, guide regions <b>62</b>, <b>66</b> are obtained which may be integral with insert <b>3</b> and base <b>2</b> respectively.</p>
<p id="p-0203" num="0201">In addition, guide regions <b>62</b>, <b>66</b> may cooperate with a part <b>64</b> that is a flat ring or similar part attached/made integral with rod <b>61</b> at its lower end.</p>
<p id="p-0204" num="0202">Flat ring <b>64</b>, an external shoulder, or some other change of cross-section with analogous widening may be arranged at a lower end of rod <b>61</b>. Here, flat ring <b>64</b> has an outer circumference of substantially the same diameter as the inside diameters of guide regions <b>62</b>, <b>66</b>, so that, when lid <b>5</b> transitions between the open position and the closed position, flat ring <b>64</b> guides rod <b>61</b> in its movements of transverse displacement and rotation. This guidance restricts, for example, any possibility of incline for rod <b>61</b>, which implies that axis Z<b>2</b> remains substantially parallel to central axis Z<b>1</b>. The result here is that, in the open position, lid <b>5</b> can remain substantially parallel to lower surface <b>21</b> of base <b>2</b> or at least retain its general orientation parallel to plane (XY).</p>
<p id="p-0205" num="0203">The term flat ring <b>64</b> is used to designate this part, although any other part capable of carrying out the functions described below may be used in place of a flat ring. Similarly, rod <b>61</b> and flat ring <b>64</b> may form one and the same piece.</p>
<p id="p-0206" num="0204">As can be seen in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>1</b>A and <b>1</b>B</figref>, the opening/closing system allows obtaining a minimal bulk for container <b>1</b>: the elements enabling the transition between the open and closed position are received between base <b>2</b> and insert <b>3</b> and are therefore invisible from outside container <b>1</b>. This also adds an aesthetic dimension to the whole. In addition, the opening/closing system allows the transition between the open and closed position by exerting a single driving force, preferably with a finger, which makes the use of the container very pleasant and intuitive for a user.</p>
<p id="p-0207" num="0205">In order to prevent container <b>1</b> from being opened inadvertently, a restraint system is also provided. This restraint system may comprise a spring <b>71</b> positioned around rod <b>61</b> between insert <b>3</b> and flat ring <b>64</b>. In the closed position, spring <b>71</b> is here in the released position so that it exerts pressure on flat ring <b>64</b>, which prevents rod <b>61</b> from moving transversely relative to lower surface <b>21</b> of base <b>2</b> without a driving force being exerted.</p>
<p id="p-0208" num="0206">More generally, container <b>1</b> may integrate a restraint system, arranged internally in container <b>1</b>, and making it possible to urge/force lid <b>5</b> towards the closed position by keeping rod <b>61</b> in a position referred to as proximal relative to bottom wall P<b>2</b> (including lower surface <b>21</b>) of base <b>2</b> which is a wall axially opposite to the opening or similar access(es) closed off by lid <b>5</b>. A return member, whether in the form of a spring <b>71</b> or other return mechanism, can assist with the return to the closed position in some options.</p>
<p id="p-0209" num="0207">In most figures, an elastic return member such as spring <b>71</b>, for example a coil spring, is included in the restraint system. Of course, any other return member coupled to rod <b>61</b> may be suitable for driving or biasing rod <b>61</b> towards the proximal position.</p>
<p id="p-0210" num="0208">As can be seen in particular in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b>A</figref>, the lid <b>5</b> comprises a contact portion PC resting on an upper surface S<b>32</b> of peripheral edge <b>32</b>. Contact portion PC may have, at the rear of lid <b>5</b>, a inclined sub-portion which is offset radially inwards relative to rod <b>61</b>, i.e. located closer to central axis Z<b>1</b>. Such a sub-portion can slide in an annular region of upper surface S<b>32</b> surrounding rod <b>61</b> and/or make it possible to contribute to establishing an annular seal around upper opening O.</p>
<p id="p-0211" num="0209">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b>D</figref>, an open position of lid <b>5</b> is illustrated with a closure portion <b>50</b> shifted to behind upper opening O, for example after a driving force was exerted on lid <b>5</b> to achieve a rotation greater than or equal to 100&#xb0; and typically close to 180&#xb0;, as in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b>D</figref>. This force has allowed energy to accumulate in the return member; this energy can be at least partly restored when lid <b>5</b> is closed.</p>
<p id="p-0212" num="0210">Shown here is the open position of lid <b>5</b> with a fully accessible upper opening O (100% shift of lid <b>5</b>). More generally, lid <b>5</b> can occupy any open position sufficient to allow access to receiving space <b>31</b>. As in other options described further below, rod <b>61</b> may protrude by an axial distance H, measured parallel to axis Z<b>2</b> of rod <b>61</b>, which exceeds for example 2 or 3 millimeters, when lid <b>5</b> is brought to an open position. Rod <b>61</b> thus extends with an axial spacing above peripheral edge <b>32</b>, up to the intersection with closure portion <b>50</b>. Axial distance H may be greater than or equal to the height of outer surface S<b>32</b> of peripheral edge <b>32</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0213" num="0211">Another embodiment of a container <b>1</b> is now described, with reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>2</b>A and <b>2</b>B</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0214" num="0212">The only difference between the first embodiment illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>1</b>A to <b>1</b>D</figref> and this second embodiment is that the opening/closing system does not comprise a guide, meaning it comprises nothing equivalent to the two guide regions <b>62</b>, <b>66</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0215" num="0213">Thus, when container <b>1</b> transitions from the closed position to the open position, rod <b>61</b> is not guided in its transverse movement relative to lower surface <b>21</b> of base <b>2</b>. As a result, in its open position, lid <b>5</b> can be tilted relative to lower surface <b>21</b> of base <b>2</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0216" num="0214">One advantage of this embodiment is that the number of parts is reduced if guide regions <b>62</b>, <b>66</b> are added pieces or the manufacture of base <b>2</b> and insert <b>3</b> is facilitated since it does not require guide regions <b>62</b>, <b>66</b>. In addition, the tilting of lid <b>5</b> into the open position provides an aesthetic and original effect for the user of container <b>1</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0217" num="0215">In some options, a rotation-preventing effect between insert <b>3</b> and base <b>2</b> is obtained by reliefs located in base-insert attachment regions (bottom and/or top).</p>
<p id="p-0218" num="0216"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>3</b>A to <b>3</b>C</figref> illustrate a container <b>1</b> according to a third embodiment.</p>
<p id="p-0219" num="0217">In this embodiment, the opening/closing system comprises:</p>
<p id="p-0220" num="0218">a guided portion <b>65</b> enabling an anchoring of rod <b>61</b>; and</p>
<p id="p-0221" num="0219">a guide region or guide <b>66</b>, which predetermines the path of portion <b>65</b> during the movement of lid <b>5</b> with its rod <b>61</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0222" num="0220">More generally, rod <b>61</b>, which is integral in rotation with the rest of lid <b>5</b>, may support an anchoring portion <b>65</b> which is guided axially and also in rotation by a guide <b>66</b>. Guide <b>66</b> may be implemented in the form of a helical relief, for example a groove or a rib, formed in a fixed portion of base <b>2</b> and/or of insert <b>3</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0223" num="0221">Guide <b>66</b> defines a guide region, here formed by a tubular structure&#x2014;typically of substantially circular cross-section, extending from peripheral edge <b>32</b> of insert <b>3</b> towards lower surface <b>21</b> of base <b>2</b>. Advantageously, the relief corresponding to the guide region surrounds rod <b>61</b>. The guide region has for example at least one helical track or groove provided on the inner surface of guide <b>66</b> which here is of cylindrical structure and arranged under the region of edge <b>32</b> which includes hole <b>69</b>, as can be seen for example in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b>C</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0224" num="0222">Guide <b>66</b> may be an added piece, fixed to insert <b>3</b> by any suitable means.</p>
<p id="p-0225" num="0223">Alternatively, guide <b>66</b> forming the guide region may be formed integrally with insert <b>3</b>, as a single piece for example.</p>
<p id="p-0226" num="0224">Anchoring portion <b>65</b> also has a generally cylindrical shape, with an outside diameter substantially equal to the inside diameter of guide <b>66</b>. With reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b>C</figref>, a base wall is provided in cylindrical anchoring portion <b>65</b> or a similar portion having a narrowing cross-section which allows forming an internal shoulder or similar internal gripping edge. The anchoring portion may extend parallel to central axis Z<b>1</b> while extending around axis Z<b>2</b>, from the base wall to a high/distal end of the bottom wall of base <b>2</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0227" num="0225">Here, for example, provision is made for a base wall which is solid and pierced with a hole, so as to be traversed via this hole by a lower end of rod <b>61</b> (end of the rod provided opposite to where rod <b>61</b>&#x2014;closure portion <b>50</b> join). This base wall faces bottom wall P<b>2</b> (forming lower surface <b>21</b>) of base <b>2</b>, while the upper end of anchoring portion <b>65</b> axially faces an underside of peripheral edge <b>32</b> of insert <b>3</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0228" num="0226">Anchoring portion <b>65</b> is mounted in guide <b>66</b> and is movable according to the associated guide region. Guidance is for example made possible by the presence of one or more lug(s) <b>67</b> cooperating with the helical track or groove (or along a helical rib). The lug projects radially outwards relative to the rest of the tube wall constituting anchoring portion <b>65</b>. In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>3</b>A and <b>3</b>B</figref>, it can be seen that anchoring portion <b>65</b> is located at a lower end of rod <b>61</b>, being axially integral with this lower end. The anchoring portion may be an intermediate part which enables the anchoring of rod <b>61</b>, here in insert <b>3</b>. In alternatives, anchoring portion <b>65</b> may be included in the part that constitutes rod <b>61</b>, and ensures anchoring directly into insert <b>3</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0229" num="0227">Given this anchoring of rod <b>61</b>, when the driving force is exerted on an external/accessible portion of lid <b>5</b> in order to exit the closed position or conversely to return to the closed position, the rotation and the transverse displacement of rod <b>61</b> cause movement of lug(s) <b>67</b> in the helical track. This makes it possible to prevent too rapid of an ascent which could impact the proper functioning of the opening/closing mechanism after repeated uses, or an insufficient ascent of lid <b>5</b>, with the possibility of reducing undesirable friction of contact portion PC against upper surface S<b>32</b> of peripheral edge <b>32</b> during rotation of lid <b>5</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0230" num="0228">In this embodiment, the lower end of rod <b>61</b> is retained in anchoring portion <b>65</b>. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>3</b>A to <b>3</b>C</figref>, anchoring portion <b>65</b> has a hole into which the (lower) end of rod <b>61</b> is inserted. Optionally, the lower end of rod <b>61</b> has a larger diameter than the hole, such that rod <b>61</b> cannot be removed from anchoring portion or part <b>65</b>. Rod <b>61</b> may also have two protuberances engaging in spaces or notches, typically of complementary shapes, of portion <b>65</b> which prevent the rotation of rod <b>61</b> alone (rotation-preventing effect). Thus, for example, the protuberances of rod <b>61</b>, formed as external radial projections coincident with the level of the base wall of portion <b>65</b>, are engaged in the spaces of portion <b>65</b>, possibly with a generally square shape/cross-section for these protuberances (cross-section made in a plane parallel to reference plane (XY)).</p>
<p id="p-0231" num="0229">When container <b>1</b> transitions between the closed position and the open position, rod <b>61</b> executes the movements of translation and transverse displacement described above. The engagement of portion <b>65</b> by the protuberances or similar reliefs of rod <b>61</b> then causes the movement of anchoring portion <b>65</b>, and more particularly of lugs <b>67</b> of portion <b>65</b>, in the helical track.</p>
<p id="p-0232" num="0230">Regarding spring <b>71</b> or an equivalent return member of the restraint system, this may be interposed axially between insert <b>3</b> and anchoring portion <b>65</b>, for example resting axially from above on the base wall of anchoring portion <b>65</b>. It is understood that spring <b>71</b> may be placed between the region of edge <b>32</b> defining hole <b>69</b>, and the base wall defining the hole of anchoring portion <b>65</b> (this latter hole here being in vertical alignment with hole <b>69</b>, axis Z<b>3</b> being able to traverse these two holes). When container <b>1</b> is in the closed position with the restraint system which urges the lower end of rod <b>61</b> into the position proximal to the bottom of base <b>2</b> (here with spring <b>71</b> in its relaxed position, driving anchoring portion <b>65</b> downwards), this prevents any movement of rod <b>61</b> and therefore the transition from the closed position to the open position without a driving force being exerted (no accidental opening, even in the event of a sudden impact during transport, for example).</p>
<p id="p-0233" num="0231">The configuration of this third embodiment, regardless of the design specifically chosen for the restraint system, reinforces the guidance of rod <b>61</b> during the transition between the open position and the closed position.</p>
<p id="p-0234" num="0232">In this embodiment, in the open position, lid <b>5</b> can be kept parallel to lower surface <b>21</b> or bottom wall P<b>2</b> of base <b>2</b>. More generally, a helical guide implemented at a rod portion inserted under edge <b>32</b> can accompany the desired movement for lid <b>5</b>, which is typically a movement which remains substantially parallel to plane (XY), i.e. transverse relative to central axis Z<b>2</b> which passes through upper opening O.</p>
<p id="p-0235" num="0233"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>4</b>A to <b>4</b>C</figref> illustrate a fourth embodiment.</p>
<p id="p-0236" num="0234">In this embodiment, the guide region of the opening system does not comprise a helical track but at least one lug <b>67</b> is provided in guide <b>66</b> which may be designed as a sub-portion of insert <b>3</b>, in the same piece for example. In this embodiment, guide <b>66</b> is also of cylindrical structure and prevents rod <b>61</b> from tilting/changing direction relative to axis Z<b>2</b> around which lid <b>5</b> can rotate. Although the guide region here is implemented entirely with insert <b>3</b>, a design by assembling different parts may also be suitable.</p>
<p id="p-0237" num="0235">Rod <b>61</b> has a helical track cooperating with lug <b>67</b> of guide <b>66</b>. The track may correspond to a groove which extends at least 180&#xb0; around axis Z<b>2</b>. The rotation of lid <b>5</b> to 180&#xb0; is clearly visible in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b>B</figref>, with contact portion PC entirely raised above peripheral wall <b>22</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0238" num="0236">Thus, when driving force is exerted and container <b>1</b> transitions between the open position and the closed position, the rotation and the transverse displacement of rod <b>61</b> follow the shape of the helical track, due to lug <b>67</b> of guide <b>66</b> which engages with the helical track (here by fitting into the groove). The groove shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b>C</figref> may have an axially downward outlet, to allow mounting lug <b>67</b> with insertion, when rod <b>61</b> of lid <b>5</b> is fitted into guide <b>66</b> by passing through hole <b>69</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0239" num="0237">In this embodiment, the restraint system comprises lug <b>67</b> of guide <b>66</b> as well as rod <b>61</b>. More particularly, the restraint is obtained by tightening rod <b>61</b> and lug <b>67</b>. In addition, an indexing of the closed position, preferably with a locking effect, may be made possible by providing a recess or a relief with a gripping edge <b>39</b> on peripheral edge <b>32</b>, here on upper surface S<b>32</b>. Contact portion PC of lid <b>5</b> may have a projection or a complementary relief which engages, for example in an elastically deformable manner, into/against relief <b>39</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0240" num="0238">This embodiment has the advantage of a reduced number of elements forming the opening/closing and restraint systems. This therefore facilitates the manufacture of container <b>1</b>, while offering minimal dimensions.</p>
<p id="p-0241" num="0239"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>5</b>A to <b>5</b>D</figref> illustrate examples in accordance with a fifth embodiment of a container <b>1</b> according to the invention.</p>
<p id="p-0242" num="0240">The fifth embodiment differs from the first embodiment in that a material of rod <b>61</b> is flexible. Rod <b>61</b> may for example deform and/or be provided with a hinge. Thus, with reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>5</b>A and <b>5</b>B</figref>, when container <b>1</b> transitions between the open position and the closed position, rod <b>61</b> bends due to the angle formed between the plane of lid <b>5</b> (the lid being raised at an angle along upper surface S<b>32</b> of peripheral edge <b>32</b>) and peripheral edge <b>32</b>. The slope or incline provided at the rear of contact portion PC, once swiveled&#x2014;for example by 180&#xb0; as in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b>B</figref>&#x2014;no longer matches the incline of upper surface S<b>32</b> enabling lid <b>5</b> to remain perpendicular to axes Z<b>1</b> and Z<b>2</b>. This is why lid <b>5</b> tends to rise obliquely on the rear side relative to insert <b>3</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0243" num="0241">A variation of this embodiment is illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>5</b>C and <b>5</b>D</figref>. Here, the cross-section of rod <b>61</b> at its point of junction with lid <b>5</b> is thinner/finer than the rest of rod <b>61</b>. A portion of rod <b>61</b>, possibly with a rigid portion or ring <b>64</b> attached, here remains guided axially, so that rod <b>61</b> remains aligned with hole <b>69</b>, as in the case of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>5</b>A and <b>5</b>B</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0244" num="0242">Advantageously, the top of rod <b>61</b> with its thinning allows greater flexibility of rod <b>61</b>, in order to obtain a hinge effect. Thus, the appearance of stress potentially applied to the point of junction between rod <b>61</b> and closure portion <b>50</b> of lid <b>5</b> during the transition of container <b>1</b> between the open position and the closed position is avoided. Instead, closure portion <b>50</b> rises as lid <b>5</b> and rod <b>61</b> slide and rise, overcoming the stress exerted by the return member, here in the form of spring <b>71</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0245" num="0243">In other variants, this flexible arrangement of the top of rod <b>61</b> may be adopted with other guide structures, where appropriate with a helical track. Where appropriate, upper surface S<b>32</b> or the top of wall <b>22</b> may have a projection or a specific geometry at the rear of container <b>1</b>, allowing the rising effect of closure portion <b>50</b> only in the event of an overlap between lid <b>5</b> and the back of the rest of container <b>1</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0246" num="0244">The sixth embodiment of container <b>1</b> is illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>6</b>A to <b>6</b>C</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0247" num="0245">In this embodiment, the opening/closing system comprises anchoring portion <b>65</b> and guide <b>66</b> which forms a guide region, here helical.</p>
<p id="p-0248" num="0246">As in the third embodiment, the guide region is formed by a guide that is rigid (or fixed with respect to insert <b>3</b>) with a substantially circular structure, extending from peripheral edge <b>32</b> of insert <b>3</b> towards lower surface <b>21</b> of base <b>2</b>. Advantageously, the guide region produced by guide <b>66</b> surrounds rod <b>61</b>. Guide <b>66</b> has at least one helical track, here a groove, on its inner surface.</p>
<p id="p-0249" num="0247">Guide <b>66</b> may be or may include an added piece fixed to insert <b>3</b> by any suitable means. Alternatively, guide <b>66</b> may be entirely included in a component part of insert <b>3</b>, without any assembly of various parts.</p>
<p id="p-0250" num="0248">Anchoring portion <b>65</b> may also have a generally cylindrical shape or a shape suitable for maintaining an axial orientation of rod <b>61</b>, parallel to axis Z<b>2</b>. Here, portion <b>65</b> has an outside diameter substantially equal to the inside diameter of guide <b>66</b>. A radial wall of portion <b>65</b> is provided with an axial hole in vertical alignment with hole <b>69</b>, here in the top of anchoring portion <b>65</b>. Anchoring portion <b>65</b> is hollow in order to accommodate all or part of a return member such as a spring</p>
<p id="p-0251" num="0249">Unlike the embodiment of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>3</b>A to <b>3</b>C</figref>, the cavity of guide <b>66</b> opens towards the bottom, with an axial opening which faces bottom wall P<b>2</b> of base <b>2</b>, while the solid radial portion of the anchoring portion can face peripheral edge <b>32</b> of insert <b>3</b>. One may note that anchoring portion <b>65</b> may be of a similar or identical design to that shown in the third embodiment, but arranged upside down along another direction of axis Z<b>2</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0252" num="0250">Anchoring portion <b>65</b> is mounted in the guide region of guide <b>66</b> and may comprise a lug <b>67</b> projecting radially outwards cooperating with the helical track (typically mounted via a lower axial outlet of a helical groove constituting this track). Thus, when driving force is exerted and container <b>1</b> transitions between the open position and the closed position, the rotation and transverse displacement of rod <b>61</b> cause the movement of lug <b>67</b> in the helical track.</p>
<p id="p-0253" num="0251">In this embodiment, the lower end of rod <b>61</b> carries the anchoring portion and, once anchoring portion <b>65</b> is mounted in guide <b>66</b>, the lid <b>5</b> cannot be detached from the insert <b>3</b>. The assembly may vary. Attachment at the hole of anchoring portion <b>65</b> may be provided, as in the case described for the third embodiment.</p>
<p id="p-0254" num="0252">As can be seen in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>6</b>A to <b>6</b>C</figref>, the segment of rod <b>61</b> formed from closure portion <b>50</b> may be shorter than in the third embodiment. Indeed, here anchoring portion <b>65</b> may extend rod <b>61</b> axially (downwards).</p>
<p id="p-0255" num="0253">This makes it possible to have space in the cylinder or guide <b>66</b> in order to place a spring <b>68</b> or other return device therein, possibly of the magnetic type. More precisely here, a spring <b>68</b>, for example helical, is received in the guide by being housed (at least in part) in a tubular/cylindrical section of anchoring portion <b>65</b>. Spring <b>68</b> extends from the bottom wall of base <b>2</b> to the lower end of rod <b>61</b>, received in the hole of guide <b>65</b>, the spring having a movable end resting on the radial portion of anchoring portion <b>65</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0256" num="0254">In the closed position and as can be seen in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>6</b>A</figref>, spring <b>68</b> is in a state of compression, so that it urges rod <b>61</b> and guide <b>65</b> upwards. This biasing cannot be exerted in the closed position, due to the presence of a locking device which is part of the restraint system.</p>
<p id="p-0257" num="0255">The restraint system here comprises interlocking or locking means (<b>76</b>, <b>77</b>) placed for example at the front in this non-limiting case. Such means will be further described with reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>12</b></figref>. These interlocking means make it possible to lock lid <b>5</b> relative to insert <b>3</b>, in order to maintain the closed position despite the return effect which tends to cause lid <b>5</b> to rise. These interlocking means can be unlocked by the driving force exerted on lid <b>5</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0258" num="0256">When the interlocking means are unlocked by the driving force exerted on lid <b>5</b>, spring <b>68</b> transitions to its rest position which causes the automatic opening of the lid. When transitioning from the closed position to the open position, rod <b>61</b> executes the movements of translation and transverse displacement described above. The protuberances of rod <b>61</b> then cause the movement of guide <b>65</b>, and more particularly of lugs <b>67</b> in the helical track. More generally, the rod <b>61</b> with its anchoring portion <b>65</b> forms a slide assembly which is by default in the high position in guide <b>66</b>, in the absence of an action retaining/locking the closed position.</p>
<p id="p-0259" num="0257">A seventh embodiment will now be described with reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>7</b>A-<b>7</b>D</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0260" num="0258">The difference between this seventh embodiment and the first embodiment is that rod <b>61</b> and closure portion <b>50</b> of lid <b>5</b> are not integral. In other words, rod <b>61</b> may be created as a separate part before assembly. Here, assembly allows closure portion <b>50</b> to be made integral with rod <b>61</b>, in particular at least integral in axial translation along axis Z<b>2</b> so that the rising of rod <b>61</b> allows lid <b>5</b> as a whole to rise.</p>
<p id="p-0261" num="0259">In the option illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>7</b>A and <b>7</b>B</figref>, rod <b>61</b> and lid <b>5</b> are fixed to each other by a hinge connection <b>52</b>, for example a pin hinge.</p>
<p id="p-0262" num="0260">In the variant illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>7</b>C and <b>7</b>D</figref>, rod <b>61</b> and lid <b>5</b> are fixed to each other by a ball joint <b>53</b>. These connections <b>52</b>, <b>53</b> allow lid <b>5</b> to move back and forth (rod <b>61</b> being at the rear) via the rotation of the rod <b>61</b> which is typically guided in its housing. These connections <b>52</b>, <b>53</b> are compatible with a movement path of lid <b>5</b> which remains transverse relative to axis Z<b>2</b>, as well as enabling movement once lid <b>5</b> is located at the rear of container <b>1</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0263" num="0261">Thus, during the transition of container <b>1</b> from the closed position to the open position, hinge <b>52</b>, <b>53</b> also allows pivoting lid <b>5</b> to move it relative to rod <b>61</b>. Typically, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b>B</figref>, when container <b>1</b> is in the open position, lid <b>5</b> can be inclined relative to lower surface <b>21</b> of base <b>2</b>, thus exiting an arrangement perpendicular to axes Z<b>1</b> and Z<b>2</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0264" num="0262">These options make it possible in particular to reduce the stress potentially applied to the area where rod <b>61</b> and lid <b>5</b> are joined, when container <b>1</b> transitions between the open position and the closed position.</p>
<p id="p-0265" num="0263">A return effect has been illustrated here which urges rod <b>61</b> towards its low position/proximal to bottom wall P<b>2</b>, to facilitate obtaining the closed position. Of course, it is also possible to provide a default of returning to the open position and, in this case, an axial locking of the closed/lowered position of lid <b>5</b> may possibly be achieved by a suitable locking device.</p>
<p id="p-0266" num="0264">An eighth embodiment is illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>8</b>A and <b>8</b>B</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0267" num="0265">In this embodiment, the opening/closing system also comprises a lid <b>5</b> supported by a rod <b>61</b>, but also with a track <b>109</b> provided on the (internal) face of lid <b>5</b>, facing insert <b>3</b>. Advantageously, track <b>109</b> may be substantially straight, running between two diametrically opposite ends. For example, track <b>109</b> may extend from the front to the back of lid <b>5</b>. It may typically be an integral part of the part which constitutes the lid <b>5</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0268" num="0266">Rod <b>61</b> and lid <b>5</b> are two separate elements in this embodiment. A portion of rod <b>61</b> is received in insert <b>3</b>, axially through hole <b>69</b>. Rod <b>61</b> extends towards and for example all the way to (in the closed position) the bottom wall forming lower surface <b>21</b> of base <b>2</b>. Rod <b>61</b> comprises a portion <b>61</b>A extending beyond hole <b>69</b> of the insert, called the outer portion. Portion <b>61</b>A of rod <b>61</b>, here in the form of a bent outer portion as can be seen in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>8</b>B</figref>, includes a male member engaged in an elongated cavity, from front to rear, defined between two parallel sides of track <b>109</b>. This male member of portion <b>61</b>A is slidably mounted in the elongated cavity, parallel to closure portion <b>50</b> of lid <b>5</b>, and advantageously may form a right angle with the rest of rod <b>61</b> which extends along the direction of axis Z<b>2</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0269" num="0267">The end of portion <b>61</b>A of rod <b>61</b> may form a lug or comparable male member engaged in track <b>109</b>, track <b>109</b> here being arranged in the form of a runner or rail which defines a rectilinear groove. In some variants, the track is formed in the thickness of lid <b>5</b> without forming any interior relief. Folded edges <b>109</b>&#x2032; of track <b>109</b> are optionally provided for axial retention of the lug or male member, so that the latter can engage/slide in track <b>109</b> for the transition between the closed position and the open position.</p>
<p id="p-0270" num="0268">According to this embodiment, to transition container <b>1</b> from the closed position to the open position, driving force is to be exerted at the front of lid <b>5</b>, but in a radial direction (directed towards the rear), as illustrated for example by arrow F<b>8</b> in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>8</b>A</figref>. In particular, the driving force is typically to be exerted from the front of lid <b>5</b> towards the center of lid <b>5</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0271" num="0269">The driving force causes lid <b>5</b> to move relative to rod <b>61</b>, due to the movement of track <b>109</b> guided by the lug or comparable male member in portion <b>61</b>A. This movement also causes the transverse displacement of rod <b>61</b> relative to lower surface <b>21</b> of base <b>2</b>, due to the sliding (with lifting effect) of a portion of peripheral end <b>51</b> of lid <b>5</b> on peripheral edge <b>32</b> of insert <b>3</b>, analogously to what has been described above.</p>
<p id="p-0272" num="0270">Furthermore, in order to avoid an inadvertent transition from the open position to the closed position, a locking effect may be obtained by a clamping and/or retaining means associated with track <b>109</b>. For example, track <b>109</b> has a reduction in cross-section/width, therefore a passage for the lug that is locally smaller and slightly less than the width of lug <b>110</b>, at its end in contact with lug <b>110</b> in the open position (as can be seen in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>8</b>B</figref> for example), which makes it possible to obtain end-of-travel clamping. Lid <b>5</b> can be tilted significantly, following the incline of upper surface S<b>32</b> in the region adjacent to hole <b>69</b>. In this option, the rod may be rigid <b>61</b>, with no bent/flexed area. A rotation-preventing effect of rod <b>61</b> may be provided, or at least the rotation of the rod may be limited to a small angle, for example less than 5 or 10&#xb0;. The bottom of rod <b>61</b> (in the rod or in an added piece) may, if necessary, have a flat surface or a relief providing a rotation-preventing effect.</p>
<p id="p-0273" num="0271">Optionally, inside space <b>31</b> delimited by insert <b>3</b> may be offset relative to wall <b>22</b>, for example so that the front end of lid <b>5</b> in the open and locked position does not interfere with access to product <b>41</b> via upper opening O. In this case, an upper surface <b>32</b> has been illustrated which borders only part of upper opening O or may have variable spacing away from upper opening O. Such an option is applicable in most of the other options illustrated elsewhere.</p>
<p id="p-0274" num="0272">In this embodiment, the restraint system also comprises a return member, for example with spring <b>71</b> and a retaining means (here flat ring <b>64</b>) for the movable end of the return member, such as described above with reference to the other embodiments.</p>
<p id="p-0275" num="0273"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>9</b>A to <b>9</b>C</figref> illustrate a ninth embodiment of a container <b>1</b> according to the invention.</p>
<p id="p-0276" num="0274">In this embodiment, the opening/closing system comprises rod <b>61</b> and lid <b>5</b>. It further comprises a guide region, here in a rigid guide <b>66</b>, which is separate from insert <b>3</b> and for example adjacent to the insert. Optionally, guide <b>66</b> has a cylindrical shape surrounding rod <b>61</b>. In one exemplary embodiment, the inside diameter of guide <b>66</b> forming the guide region is substantially equal to the outside diameter of rod <b>61</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0277" num="0275">Guide <b>66</b> may have at least one lug <b>67</b>, cooperating with a track <b>111</b> provided on rod <b>61</b>, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>9</b>D to <b>9</b>F</figref>. Two diametrically opposed lugs <b>77</b> may be provided. Guide <b>66</b> is axially blocked between base <b>2</b> (from below) and an edge portion or relief of insert <b>3</b>, for example directly by peripheral edge <b>32</b> of insert <b>3</b> in a portion adjacent to hole <b>69</b> and typically offset radially inward relative to hole <b>69</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0278" num="0276">Typically, a depression in peripheral edge <b>32</b>, forming a downward-opening recess, receives the top of guide <b>66</b> by:</p>
<p id="p-0279" num="0277">forming a zone for axial abutment from above by cooperating with an edge portion <b>66</b>B of guide <b>66</b>, edge portion <b>66</b>B optionally extending from the interior side relative to rod <b>61</b> (radially between axis Z<b>1</b> and axis Z<b>2</b>) and which has two extreme edges defining an upper notch <b>66</b><i>e </i>of guide <b>66</b>; and</p>
<p id="p-0280" num="0278">blocking rotation of guide <b>66</b> beyond a certain threshold, for example to limit rotation to approximately 20&#xb0; or slightly less, by forming stops against which the extreme edges rest.</p>
<p id="p-0281" num="0000">Axial spacing E can then be obtained only at notch <b>66</b><i>e</i>, further back than rod <b>61</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0282" num="0279">Additionally or alternatively, base <b>2</b> opposes any axial rising of guide <b>66</b>, for example by coming to engage against a complementary relief located at a distance from the top of guide <b>66</b>. As described below, an axial spacing E between peripheral edge <b>32</b> and the top of guide <b>66</b> is provided in the closed position (visible in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>9</b>A</figref>), to allow the combined depression of lid <b>5</b> and insert <b>3</b> towards bottom wall P<b>2</b> of base <b>2</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0283" num="0280">The opening/closing system here may comprise a first return member, for example a first spring <b>112</b>, located between the lower end of rod <b>61</b> and the lower surface <b>21</b> of base <b>2</b>. Other arrangements of such a return member are allowed for urging the rod towards an extension configuration in which the rod is distal from bottom wall P<b>2</b> of base <b>2</b>. For example, the rod may incorporate a repulsion magnet and/or a compressible member in its lower end. The opening/closing system also comprises a second return member, for example a second spring <b>113</b> located between lower surface <b>21</b> of base <b>2</b> and insert <b>3</b>, under receiving space <b>31</b> for cosmetic product <b>41</b>. In this embodiment, insert <b>3</b> is thus movable relative to base <b>2</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0284" num="0281">In the closed position, first spring <b>112</b> is in a state of compression, so that it exerts an upward pressure on rod <b>61</b>. Second spring <b>113</b> is in a state of relaxation. The axial retention of rod <b>61</b> can be implemented under peripheral edge <b>32</b>, for example by an abutment element provided in guide <b>66</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0285" num="0282">To move container <b>1</b> from the closed position to the open position, the driving force is to be exerted (by the user) downwards on the outer face of lid <b>5</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>9</b>B</figref>, see arrow F<b>9</b> indicating the force's direction). The driving force then forces first spring <b>112</b> into an even more compressed state and also compresses second spring <b>113</b>. The driving force also makes it possible to unlock the restraint system, described in more detail below, which then no longer retains container <b>1</b> in the closed position.</p>
<p id="p-0286" num="0283">Then, as can be seen in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>9</b>C</figref>, first spring <b>112</b> which enters its released state automatically causes opening with access to product <b>41</b>, driving rod <b>61</b> in a transverse movement relative to lower surface <b>21</b> of the base. Lug <b>67</b> of guide <b>66</b> is engaged in a helical portion <b>61</b><i>h </i>of track <b>111</b> (here a groove) of rod <b>61</b>, guiding the rod in a rotational movement which also drives lid <b>5</b> to rotate about its axis of rotation (therefore around axis Z<b>2</b> which is also a central axis for guide <b>66</b>). In the open position, second spring <b>113</b> returns to its relaxed position. Second spring <b>113</b> therefore enables the automatic movement and repositioning of insert <b>3</b> relative to base <b>2</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0287" num="0284">Furthermore, cleats or axial abutment reliefs R<b>2</b>, R<b>3</b> may be provided on base <b>2</b> and/or insert <b>3</b>. For example, base <b>2</b> has at least one fixed relief R<b>2</b>, optionally projecting radially inwards from the inner face of an internal wall defining a cavity C<b>2</b> for receiving the member forming second spring <b>113</b>. Fixed relief R<b>2</b> may form an axial abutment which is engaged from below by a complementary portion or suitable relief R<b>3</b> of insert <b>3</b>, provided in an anchoring bottom of the insert which penetrates cavity C<b>2</b>. Relief R<b>3</b> is thus suitable for placement in an outer groove <b>115</b> provided on base <b>2</b>, under relief R<b>2</b>. More generally, any coupling suitable for a limited sliding of insert <b>3</b> in base <b>2</b> may be provided, with lid <b>5</b> embedded within inside volume V. The displacement of insert <b>3</b> relative to base <b>2</b> is thus controlled, with no risk of detachment of insert <b>3</b>, preferably with axial guidance of insert <b>3</b> by means of peripheral edge <b>32</b> which runs along the inner face of peripheral wall <b>22</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0288" num="0285">In this embodiment, the restraint system is distributed in guide <b>66</b>, which includes for example one or two lugs <b>67</b>, and in rod <b>61</b>, at a portion of track <b>111</b>. The restraint system is more particularly illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>9</b>D to <b>9</b>F</figref> which are enlarged views of track <b>111</b> with its helical portion, and of lug <b>67</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0289" num="0286"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>9</b>D</figref> illustrates the restraint system when container <b>1</b> is in the closed position. A housing <b>111</b>A is provided in continuity with an upper end of the helical portion of track <b>111</b> and forms an elbow bend with this upper end of the helical guide region. Lug <b>67</b> of guide <b>66</b> is received in the bottom of housing <b>111</b>A, the top of housing <b>111</b>A corresponding to a point in a path segment in the shape of an inverted &#x201c;V&#x201d;. By thus occupying the bottom of housing <b>111</b>A (under the tip/upper end of the guide region), lug <b>67</b> is not engaged in helical portion <b>61</b><i>h </i>of track <b>111</b>. The inverted V shape implies that in case of rod <b>61</b> descending, a relative rotation is necessary between rod <b>61</b> and guide <b>66</b>, the latter being rotatably mounted in base <b>2</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0290" num="0287">During the driving force from above (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>9</b>E</figref>) which lowers lid <b>5</b> with rod <b>61</b>, the cylindrical structure forming guide <b>66</b> is forced to rotate, due to lug(s) <b>67</b> received in housing <b>111</b>A of rod <b>61</b>. This rotation is advantageously quite small, for example the cylindrical structure forming guide <b>66</b> rotates between 10 and 20&#xb0;, for example more than 12 or 15&#xb0;. This rotation allows each lug <b>67</b> to be placed as high as possible in corresponding track <b>111</b>, facing the upper end of helical portion <b>61</b><i>h </i>and thus be engaged there.</p>
<p id="p-0291" num="0288">Then, when the driving force is released, lug(s) <b>67</b> no longer occupy the same (short) branch of corresponding track <b>111</b>, which allows the action of the first return member, here spring <b>112</b>. Container <b>1</b> can transition to the open position (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>9</b>F</figref>), due to the movements of rotation and transverse displacement of rod <b>61</b>, the movement of rod <b>61</b> being guided by the coupling(s) between helical portion <b>61</b><i>h </i>and corresponding lug <b>67</b> engaged therein. Helical portion <b>61</b><i>h </i>may be configured to restrict the rotation to approximately 180&#xb0; about axis Z<b>2</b>. The return to the closed position may require a simple rotation of the lid <b>5</b>, here also with a helical guiding effect but overcoming the return force exerted at the bottom of rod <b>61</b>. Inclined upper surface S<b>32</b> may optionally facilitate the engagement of lug <b>67</b> in the branch arm of track <b>111</b> forming housing <b>111</b>A, for example by participating at the end of the guiding.</p>

<p id="p-0293" num="0290">In the examples illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>10</b> to <b>11</b></figref>, the visible restraint system is the system comprising flat ring <b>64</b> and spring <b>71</b>. This is not limiting and only represents one example implementation.</p>
<p id="p-0294" num="0291">In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>10</b></figref>, the restraint system may further comprise locking means for locking lid <b>5</b> to insert <b>3</b>. The locking means comprise a protrusion <b>73</b> on peripheral end <b>51</b> of lid <b>5</b> or on peripheral edge <b>32</b> of insert <b>3</b>, respectively coupling with a cavity <b>74</b> in peripheral edge <b>32</b> of insert <b>3</b> or in peripheral end <b>51</b> of lid <b>5</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0295" num="0292">These locking means allow, in addition to locking lid <b>5</b> on insert <b>3</b>, indicating the end of travel to the user.</p>
<p id="p-0296" num="0293">In the example of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>11</b></figref>, the restraint system comprises other locking means for locking lid <b>5</b> to insert <b>3</b>, comprising magnets (here a pair of magnets <b>75</b>) or similar complementary magnetic elements. One magnet <b>75</b> is provided in peripheral end <b>51</b> of lid <b>5</b> and the other magnet is provided in peripheral edge <b>32</b> of insert <b>3</b>, so that they are invisible from the outside, at least in the closed position.</p>
<p id="p-0297" num="0294">The opposing faces of the two magnets <b>75</b> face each other, so as to be attracted to each other in the closed position.

<p id="p-0298" num="0295">In the example of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>12</b></figref>, the restraint system comprises locking or interlocking means, for locking or interlocking lid <b>5</b> and insert <b>3</b>. More specifically, the locking or interlocking means may be provided at the front of lid <b>5</b>. These means comprise for example a clip <b>77</b> or other retainer, in peripheral end <b>51</b> of lid <b>5</b>, capable of fitting in the closed position into a complementary attachment element <b>76</b>, here into a complementary engagement edge (for snap-fitting) provided in peripheral edge <b>32</b> of insert <b>3</b>.</p>

A radial tab of lid <b>5</b> projects radially outwards in order to interlock with or fit into a groove provided in upper surface S<b>32</b>, here provided for example further back than rod <b>61</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0300" num="0297"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>14</b> to <b>21</b></figref> illustrate different embodiments of a sealing system for container <b>1</b>, which allow defining an annular sealed contact in an area that is hidden in the closed position.

These options may also be used in combination with the embodiments of the containers and restraint systems described above with reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>1</b>A to <b>13</b></figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0301" num="0298">Advantageously, the options/variants of a sealing system can operate in conjunction with a restraint system. Indeed, the restraint systems make it possible to exert a force on lid <b>5</b> in the closed position, this force typically being directed downwards and therefore keeping lid <b>5</b> pressed and relatively under pressure on insert <b>3</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0302" num="0299">In the examples illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>13</b> to <b>21</b></figref>, the visible restraint system is the system comprising flat ring <b>64</b> and spring <b>71</b> or any similar return member arranged to urge the rod into the position proximal to the bottom of base <b>2</b>. This is not limiting and only represents one example implementation.</p>
<p id="p-0303" num="0300">According to the embodiment in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>14</b></figref>, sealing is achieved by a cone bearing down on a rigid retaining ring. More precisely, the peripheral end of lid <b>5</b> is similar to a cone, for example forming a frustoconical projection, and the rigid retaining ring is created by/in the angle formed between side wall <b>3</b><i>a </i>of the insert defining receiving space <b>31</b> and peripheral edge <b>32</b>. The bearing surface is increased by the force applied by the restraint system on lid <b>5</b>. It is understood that the sealing is made possible by an annular contact which is exerted axially, while also being able to include a radial component due to the radial pressure towards the inside of the rod, against contact portion PC which here is sloping/inclined.</p>
<p id="p-0304" num="0301">According to the embodiment of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>15</b></figref>, sealing is achieved by a cone bearing down on a cone. More specifically, peripheral end <b>51</b> of lid <b>5</b> is similar to a first cone (in contact portion PC, also shown in other drawings such as <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b>A</figref> for example) and a second cone is formed by peripheral edge <b>32</b> of insert <b>3</b>. The bearing surface is increased by the force applied by the restraint system on lid <b>5</b>. In this example, the restraint system further comprises locking means <b>73</b>, <b>74</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0305" num="0302">According to the embodiment in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>16</b></figref>, sealing is achieved by a cone bearing down on a retaining ring.

<p id="p-0307" num="0304">According to the embodiment of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>19</b></figref>, sealing is achieved by a cone seated bearing down on an attached elastomer cone <b>32</b><i>b</i>. More precisely, the peripheral end of lid <b>5</b> is similar to a cone, and elastomer cone <b>32</b><i>b </i>is attached in the form of an intermediate part between insert <b>3</b> and lid <b>5</b>. Elastomer cone <b>32</b><i>b </i>is for example attached to a rigid portion <b>32</b><i>a </i>of peripheral edge <b>32</b>, here over an entire annular portion <b>32</b><i>a </i>forming a portion of insert <b>3</b> which supports cone <b>32</b><i>b</i>. Elements <b>32</b><i>a </i>and <b>32</b><i>b </i>together form peripheral edge <b>32</b>. The bearing surface is increased by the force applied by the restraint system on lid <b>5</b>. In this example, upper surface S<b>32</b> is only formed by the material of the frustoconical element referred to as &#x201c;elastomer cone&#x201d; <b>32</b><i>b</i>. As an alternative, it is understood that just an annular portion of upper surface S<b>32</b> may be formed by the attached or overmolded annular portion.</p>
<p id="p-0308" num="0305">According to the embodiment of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>20</b></figref>, sealing is achieved by a cone bearing down on a retaining ring <b>84</b> of upper surface S<b>32</b>. Here, the peripheral end of lid <b>5</b> is thus similar to a cone and retaining ring <b>84</b> may be formed by a bead provided on peripheral edge <b>32</b> of insert <b>3</b>. The bearing surface is increased by the force applied by the restraint system on lid <b>5</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0309" num="0306">According to the example of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>21</b></figref>, the sealing is offset further outwards, achieved by a cone bearing down on a retaining ring <b>85</b>. More specifically, the peripheral end of lid <b>5</b> is similar to a cone and an overmolding <b>85</b> or analogous outer overlayer of base <b>2</b> may be provided. Thus, overmolding <b>85</b> of the base at the upper end of peripheral wall <b>22</b> of base <b>2</b> forms the bead. Lid <b>5</b> comes into abutment, radially from the inside, against the top of this overlayer, so that the outermost edge does not protrude beyond the top of the base thus overmolded, the effect being flush with lid <b>5</b>. The bearing surface is increased by the force applied by the restraint system on lid <b>5</b>.</p>

An oblong or non-circular shape of cap <b>8</b> may be adopted in certain embodiments.</p>
<p id="p-0315" num="0312">Lid <b>5</b> may optionally be offset radially inwards by a certain distance, for example greater than 3 mm, relative to a grippable side portion of the cap, which may make it possible to avoid interference between the connection/disconnection of cap <b>8</b> on its receptacle and the force or thrust to be exerted on lid <b>5</b> in order to obtain the opening of container <b>1</b>. Optionally, cap <b>8</b> has a closure portion and a gripping portion which are part of a sub-assembly of cap <b>8</b> which is detachable from container <b>1</b>, for example forming a recess or insertion slot L for container <b>1</b>.
