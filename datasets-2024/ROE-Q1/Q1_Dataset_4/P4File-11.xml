<heading id="h-0005" level="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION</heading>
<p id="p-0038" num="0037">Various non-limiting embodiments of the present disclosure will now be described to provide an overall understanding of the principles of the structure, function, and use of head guards having onboard sensors and componentry for data collection and transmission disclosed herein. One or more examples of these non-limiting embodiments are illustrated in the accompanying drawings. Those of ordinary skill in the art will understand that systems and methods specifically described herein and illustrated in the accompanying drawings are non-limiting embodiments. The features illustrated or described in connection with one non-limiting embodiment may be combined with the features of other non-limiting embodiments. Such modifications and variations are intended to be included within the scope of the present disclosure.</p>
<p id="p-0039" num="0038">The presently disclosed embodiments are generally directed to head guard, head guard systems, methods of using a head guard, and methods of manufacturing head guards. Head guards in accordance with the present disclosure can have one or more onboard data collection devices (referred to herein as sensors) that can collect, sense, record, or otherwise gather various information, events, environmental data, and/or operational data. Such systems and methods may be implemented in a wide variety of contexts and applications. In one example embodiment, the head guard is compressive so that it can be retained on a user's head without the use of a securing strap, such as a chinstrap. The head guards can be constructed with one or more layers, sections, or pockets of impact absorbing or impact dissipating materials, referred to generally herein as padding. The particular type of padding can vary based on a variety of factors, such as style of head guard, sporting or athletic application, type of user, size of head guard, and so forth. As described in more detail below, in some embodiments, the head guard can have three layers, including an inner layer, a middle layer, and an outer layer. The middle layer can comprise the padding. Other embodiments of head guards can have more than three layers or less than three layers. The head guard can comprise, for example, one or more thermal layers or at least portions of thermal protection (e.g., around the ears). Such embodiments can be useful for wearers participating in cold-weather endeavors. In some example embodiments, the head guard can be washable without necessarily removing the padding layer from the head guard. The head guard can also have breathable characteristics, water repellent characteristics, sweat wicking characteristics, or other comfort related characteristics, such as vents. The head guard can have water resistant or water repellant qualities. In some embodiments, the head guard can include an anti-bacterial agent, anti-microbial agent, anti-odor agent, or other deodorizing or sanitizing compounds. In some embodiments, the head guard is configured to provide protection against ultraviolet rays using any suitable techniques, such as chemical treatments, construction techniques, materials, and so forth. As described in more detail below, the head guard can be sized for a child wearer or an adult wearer. One or more sensors can be integrated into the head guard. In some embodiments, various sensors can be permanently affixed or otherwise embedded to a head guard. In other embodiments, various sensors (or portions thereof) are removable. In some embodiments, various sensors are interchangeable or swappable. The one or more sensors of a head guard can communicate with an onboard microcontroller through any suitable communications network onboard the head guard.</p>
<p id="p-0040" num="0039">In some embodiments, textile integrated sensors, sometimes referred to as bio sensing fabrics, can be utilized. Generally, textile integrated sensors can measure a large variety of variables, e.g. physical dimensions like pressure, stress and strain applied to the textile or biomedical dimensions such as heart rate, electrocardiogram (ECG), sweat rate and sweat composition (salts, pH), respiration rate of a wearer of the head guard. In some embodiments, sensor(s), electrode(s) and connections can be fully integrated in the fabric of the head guard and produced by combining conductive and non-conductive yarns.</p>
<p id="p-0041" num="0040">In some embodiments, a head guard can include various types of communication capabilities, such as wireless communication abilities. In some embodiments, a head guard can communicate on a personal area network (PAN) such as using a BLUETOOTH protocol, or other suitable near field communication (NFC) protocols, to a linked electronic device. Using this communication functionally, a head guard can provide information gathered by one or more of the sensors to a linked electronic device. Such information can be provided in real-time, substantially real-time, in batch format, or other suitable periods or timetables. Various types of electronic devices can be linked, such as mobile phones, tablets, laptop computers, desktop computers, wearables, and the like. In some embodiments, as described in more detail below, the linked electronic device can executed a specialized application that is configured to collect data and provide various visualizations, alerts, information, data, and/or other analytics to a user based on data received from an associated head guard. In some embodiments, one or more of the linked electronic devices can also be in communication with a centralized activity monitoring computing system (such as a cloud-based service) that can collect and aggregate data from a plurality of head guards.</p>
<p id="p-0042" num="0041">In some embodiments, as described in more detail below, the head guard may be worn underneath a wide variety of helmets, such as football helmets, batting helmets, bicycle helmets, and so forth. In some embodiments, the head guard may be incorporated into, formed with, or otherwise coupled to various head coverings, such as a baseball hat, a winter hat, a hood on a sweatshirt or jacket, or other styles of hat. In some embodiments, the head guard can be incorporated into apparel (hats, hoods, and so forth) in a discrete fashion, such that it is not necessarily apparent from an observer that the apparel includes the head guard. In some embodiments, a head guard can be the only piece of protective gear on the wearer's head. As described in more detail below, the head guard can be configured to cover various parts of the wearer's head, such as the crown, or be of a headband configuration that surrounds the wearer's head.</p>
<p id="p-0043" num="0042">In some embodiments, as described in more detail below, the head guard may be worn over top of a wide variety of helmets, such as football helmets, batting helmets, skateboarding helmets, snowboarding helmets, and so forth.</p>
<p id="p-0044" num="0043">As is to be appreciated, the head guard described herein can be sized to accommodate different ages of users. In one example embodiment, a child's &#x201c;one size fits all&#x201d; head guard is sized to fit children and an adult's &#x201c;one size fits all&#x201d; head guard is sized to fit adults. As described in more detail below, elastic components incorporated into the head guard can aid in maintaining the head guard on a user's head while also allowing the head guard to accommodate different sized heads. In some embodiments, head guards can be manufactured in different sizes (small, medium, large, x-large, and so forth). In some embodiments, the head guard may be selectively adjustable to accommodate different head sizes.</p>
<p id="p-0045" num="0044">Reference throughout the specification to &#x201c;various embodiments,&#x201d; &#x201c;some embodiments,&#x201d; &#x201c;one embodiment,&#x201d; &#x201c;some example embodiments,&#x201d; &#x201c;one example embodiment,&#x201d; or &#x201c;an embodiment&#x201d; means that a particular feature, structure, or characteristic described in connection with the embodiment is included in at least one embodiment.

The head guard <b>100</b> can be relatively thin as compared to the helmet <b>104</b> such that the head guard <b>100</b> does not interfere with the usability and comfort offered by the helmet <b>104</b>. As illustrated, helmet <b>104</b> is a football helmet. It is noted that the present disclosure is not limited to football helmets. Instead, a wide array of different helmets can be used in in combination with the head guard <b>100</b>, such as helmets worn by pilots, firemen, construction workers, or by any other person wearing any type of helmet or head protection. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref>, for example, illustrates a motocross helmet <b>124</b> for a head <b>122</b> of a user. A head guard <b>120</b> can be positioned over the head <b>122</b> and under the motocross helmet <b>124</b>. In the illustrated embodiment, the head guard <b>120</b> comprises a neck panel <b>126</b>. As is to be appreciated, any suitable configuration of head guard can be used with any suitable helmet. Similar to the head guard <b>100</b>, the head guard <b>120</b> also comprises an elastic member <b>126</b> which generally aids in retaining the head guard <b>120</b> on the head <b>122</b> of the user. In some embodiments, drawstrings, buckles, or other tightening features may be used.</p>
<p id="p-0049" num="0048">As is to be appreciated, the particular configuration of the head guard can be based on, for example, the type of helmet to be worn with the head guard and/or the type of activity to be performed while wearing the head guard. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref>, for example, illustrates an example head guard <b>130</b> for use with a bicycle helmet <b>134</b>. The head guard <b>130</b> can be placed on a head <b>132</b> of the user prior to securing the bicycle helmet <b>134</b> to the head <b>132</b>. In the illustrated embodiment, the compressive nature of the head guard <b>130</b> generally maintains the placement of the head guard <b>130</b> on the head <b>132</b> without the use of an additional elastic feature. While a football helmet, motocross helmet, and bicycle helmet are illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>1</b>-<b>3</b></figref>, the present disclosure is not limited to these particular application types. Instead, the head guards described herein can be used in combination with any suitable helmet type or form of head protection.</p>
<p id="p-0050" num="0049"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>4</b>-<b>16</b></figref> illustrate non-limiting examples of head guard configurations. As is to be appreciated, features of head guards of some embodiments can be incorporated into the head guards of other embodiments without departing from the scope of this disclosure. Each of the head guards in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>4</b>-<b>16</b></figref> is schematically shown to include a sensory input and communications system <b>298</b>. Head guard <b>200</b> in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b></figref>, for example, is comprised of a circumferential panel <b>202</b>, sometimes referred to as a sidewall, and a plurality of top panels <b>204</b>. The top panels <b>204</b> can be generally triangular such that, when they are coupled to each other, they generally form a disc. As described in more detail below, various types of padding can be incorporated into one or more of circumferential panel <b>202</b> and one, more than one, or none of the top panels <b>204</b>. While <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b></figref> shows an elastic member <b>206</b> coupled to the circumferential panel <b>202</b>, other embodiments may use other types of retention features. For example, elastic characteristics of the circumferential panel <b>202</b> may be used to maintain the head guard <b>200</b> on the head of a user. As with other head guards described herein, the size of the head guard <b>200</b> can be designed such that it is appropriate for the particular type of user (child, teenage, adult, and so forth).</p>
<p id="p-0051" num="0050">Head guard <b>220</b> illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b></figref> shows an embodiment that does not cover the top of a user's head. Instead, the top of the head guard <b>220</b> is open (e.g., a band-like configuration). The head guard <b>220</b> can be used, for example, for non-contacting sports. For instance, it can be worn by a soccer player who may frequently use the top of their head to contact the soccer ball. Other examples of non-contacting sports can include, without limitation, basketball, running, volleyball, or any other sport or endeavor that does not necessarily utilize a rigid helmet. While the head guard <b>220</b> is shown constructed of a plurality of panels <b>224</b>, other constructions techniques may be utilized without departing from the scope of the present disclosure. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>6</b></figref> shows yet another embodiment of a head guard <b>240</b> in accordance with the present disclosure.

<p id="p-0063" num="0060">The padding layer utilized by head guards in accordance with the present disclosure can be comprised of any suitable material that provides the desirable characteristics and response to impact. For example, the padding layer can comprise one or more of the following materials: thermoplastic polyurethane (available, for example, from Skydex Technologies), military-grade materials, impact absorbing silicone, D30&#xae; impact absorbing material, impact gel, wovens, non-wovens, cotton, elastomers, IMPAXX&#xae; energy-absorbing foam (available from Dow Automotive), DEFLEXION shock absorbing material (available from Dow Corning), styrofoam, polymer gels, general shock absorbing elastometers, visco-elastic polymers, PORON&#xae; XRD impact protection (available from Rogers Corporation), Sorbothane&#xae; (available from Sorbothane Inc.), Neoprene (available from DuPont), Ethyl Vinyl Acetate, impact-dispersing gels, foams, rubbers, and so forth. The padding layer can be breathable and/or generally porous to provide ventilation. In some embodiments, the padding layer is a mesh material that aids in the breathability of the associated head guard. The padding layer can be attached to one or more layers (such as the outer layer <b>320</b> and the inner layer <b>360</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>17</b>C</figref>, for example). In some embodiments, the padding layer <b>340</b> can be generally disconnected and &#x201c;floating&#x201d; between the layers. In some embodiments, the padding layer is attached to an elastic member or other portions of the head guard.</p>
<p id="p-0064" num="0061">In some embodiments, padding layers in accordance with the present systems and methods can comprise a rate dependent material, such as a rate dependent low density foam material. Examples of suitable low density foams include polyester and polyether polyurethane foams. In some embodiments, such foams to have a density ranging from about 5 to about 35 pounds per cubic foot (pcf), more particularly from about 10 to about 30 pcf, and more particularly still from about 15 to about 25 pcf. PORON&#xae; and PORON XRD&#xae; are available from Rogers Corporation, which are open cell, microcellular polyurethane foams, is an example of one suitable rate dependent foam. However, in order to provide impact resistance, the padding layer can be any suitable energy absorbing or rate dependent materials. As such, other rate dependent foams or other types of materials can be used without departing from the scope of the present disclosure.</p>
<p id="p-0065" num="0062">The other layers of head guards in accordance with the present disclosure can either be the same material or different material. The material can be, for example, and without limitation, polyester, nylon, spandex, ELASTENE (available from Dow Chemical), cotton, materials that glow in the dark or are fluorescent, and so forth. Either of the inner or outer layers can also be of a mesh or otherwise porous material. In some embodiments, the inner and/or outer layers can be a blend of a variety of materials, such as a spandex/polyester blend. In some embodiments, the head guard is water proof, water resistant, or water repellant. Other durable materials can be used for the outer layer of any embodiment, including knit, woven and nonwoven fabrics, leather, vinyl or any other suitable material. In some instances, it can be desirable to use materials for the layer than are somewhat elastic; therefore, stretchable fabrics, such as spandex fabrics, can be desirable. Such materials can help provide compressive forces to maintain placement of head guard on a wearer's head without the need for a chin strap, for example.</p>
<p id="p-0066" num="0063">Various head guards in accordance with the systems and methods described herein can be manufactured with or otherwise include various coatings, agents, or treatments to provide anti-microbial or anti-bacterial properties. Some embodiments, for example, can utilize Microban&#xae; offered by Microban International, Ltd. for antibacterial protection. In some embodiments, the padding layer comprises antimicrobial agents and one or more other fabric layers of the head guard also treated with antimicrobial agents. Antimicrobial protection for the fabric layers can be in the form of a chemical coating applied to the fabric, for example. Generally, antimicrobial technologies combat odor by fighting bacteria resulting in fresher smell for longer and minimizing the frequency of laundering or washing. Any suitable technique can be used to provide head guards with antimicrobial properties. In one embodiment, for example, AEGIS Microbe Shield&#xae; offered by DOW Corning Corp. is utilized. Other examples of antimicrobial agents include SILVADUR&#xae; offered by The Dow Chemical Company is utilized, Smart Silver offered by NanoHorizons, Inc., and HealthGuard&#xae; Premium Protection offered by HealthGuard.</p>
<p id="p-0067" num="0064">In some embodiments, a head guard, or at least various components of a head guard are configured to provide moisture wicking properties. Generally, moisture wicking translates into sweat management, which works by removing perspiration from the skin in an attempt to cool the wearer. Any suitable moisture wicking can be used. In one embodiment, a topical application of a moisture wicking treatment to a fabric of the head guard is utilized. The topical treatment is applied to give the head guard the ability to absorb sweat. The hydrophilic (water-absorbing) finish or treatment generally allows the head guard to absorb residue, while the hydrophobic (water-repellent) fibers of the head guard help it to dry fast, keeping the wearer more comfortable. In one embodiment, the blend of fiber is used to deliver moisture wicking properties by combining a blend of both hydrophobic (such as polyester) with hydrophilic fibers. Certain blends of these fibers allow the hydrophilic fibers to absorb fluid, moving it over a large surface area, while the hydrophobic fibers speed drying time. One benefit of head guards utilizing these types of fiber blends is that moisture management properties are inherent in the fiber blend, meaning they will never wash or wear out.</p>

<p id="p-0070" num="0067"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>22</b></figref> illustrates a cross-sectional view of a head guard <b>600</b> in accordance with one non-limiting embodiment. The head guard <b>600</b> comprises an outer layer <b>602</b>, and inner layer <b>606</b>, and a padding layer <b>608</b>. Each of the layers can be manufactured from a wide variety of materials, as described above. The overall thickness (D1) of the head guard <b>600</b> can vary based on application. In some embodiments, for example, D1 can be in the range of about 0.1&#x2033; to about 0.5&#x2033;. In some embodiments, for example, D1 can be in the range of about 0.5&#x2033; to about 1.0&#x2033;. In some embodiments, for example, D1 can be larger than about 1.0&#x2033;. The thickness can be based on, for example, the type of helmet worn with the head guard (if any), the type of sport being played while wearing the head guard, or characteristics of the wearer. While <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>22</b></figref> shows three layers, this disclosure is not so limited. As is to be appreciated, in some embodiments, head guards can have more or less layers. For example, various head guards may not utilize an inner layer.

The multi-layered top panel <b>632</b> can be attached to the multi-layered sidewall <b>634</b> using suitable stitching techniques, for example. The multi-layered top panel <b>632</b> comprises a top fabric layer <b>612</b> and a bottom fabric layer <b>616</b>. The multi-layered top panel <b>632</b> can be generally flat-shaped with the head guard <b>610</b> is in a relaxed configuration. The multi-layered top panel <b>632</b> can be generally convex-shaped with the head guard <b>610</b> is in an expanded configuration. The top fabric layer <b>612</b> and the bottom fabric layer <b>616</b> can be manufactured from a stretchable material, as described in more detail below. A padding layer <b>614</b> is positioned between the top fabric layer <b>612</b> and the bottom fabric layer <b>616</b>.

<p id="p-0073" num="0070">In the illustrated embodiment, the multi-layered sidewall <b>634</b> comprises an inner fabric layer <b>618</b>, a padding layer <b>620</b>, an outer fabric layer <b>622</b>, and an elastic member <b>624</b>. The multi-layered sidewall <b>634</b> can be generally cylindrical-shaped with the head guard <b>610</b> is in a relaxed configuration. The multi-layered sidewall <b>634</b> can be generally frustoconically-shaped with the head guard <b>610</b> is in an expanded configuration. The inner fabric layer <b>618</b> and the outer fabric layer <b>622</b> can be manufactured from a stretchable material, as described in more detail below. The inner fabric layer <b>618</b> can define an aperture <b>619</b> having any suitable size, configuration, or arrangement. The outer fabric layer <b>622</b> can define an aperture <b>623</b> having any suitable size, configuration, or arrangement that generally aligns with the aperture <b>619</b> when the head guard <b>610</b> is an assembled configuration. Furthermore, stitching or other attachment techniques can be used to join the periphery of the aperture <b>619</b> with the periphery of the aperture <b>23</b> in the assembled configuration. The side padding layer <b>620</b> is positioned between the inner fabric layer <b>618</b> and the outer fabric layer <b>622</b>. In some embodiments, the surface area of the padding layer <b>620</b> is slightly smaller than the surface area of the outer fabric layer <b>622</b>. Furthermore, the side padding layer <b>620</b> can also be stretchable, though not necessarily as stretchable as the inner fabric layer <b>618</b> and the outer fabric layer <b>622</b>. The inner fabric layer <b>618</b> and the outer fabric layer <b>622</b> can cooperate to define a pocket, with the side padding layer <b>620</b> positioned in the pocket. In some embodiments, the inner fabric layer <b>618</b> and the outer fabric layer <b>622</b> are attached in an arrangement that forms a plurality of pockets and a padding layer is positioned within each pocket such that a collection of individual padding modules or pods generally forms the padding layer.</p>
<p id="p-0074" num="0071">The side padding layer <b>620</b> can be the same or different material as the padding layer <b>614</b>. Further, these two layers can have the same or different thicknesses. The side padding layer <b>620</b> can be any suitable shape or configuration. In the illustrated example, the side padding layer <b>620</b> has a top surface <b>621</b>, a first end surface <b>630</b>, a second end surface <b>628</b>, and a bottom surface (not shown). While the side padding layer <b>620</b> is illustrated as being generally rectangular and circumferentially extending about the head guard <b>610</b>, other embodiments can utilize side padding layers <b>620</b> having different shapes. In any event, in the assembled configuration, the top surface <b>621</b> is positioned proximate to the multi-layered top panel <b>632</b>. The first end surface <b>630</b> and the second end surface <b>628</b> can be opposed and circumferentially spaced to define a gap <b>638</b>. While the gap <b>638</b> is shown as being generally rectangular, the gap <b>638</b> can have any suitable shape or size. In some embodiments, the gap <b>638</b> is positioned such that it generally aligns with the aperture <b>619</b> defined by the inner layer <b>618</b> and the aperture <b>622</b> defined by the outer layer <b>622</b>. In other embodiments, the first end surface <b>630</b> and the second end surface <b>628</b> are joined together to form a contiguous ring of padding. Moreover, in some embodiments, the padding layer <b>620</b> can generally be a contiguous ring of padding that also defines an aperture therethrough. It is noted that as with other head guards illustrated herein, the head guard <b>610</b> shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>23</b></figref> is merely an illustrative example embodiment. Thus, while the lower periphery of the head guard <b>610</b> is illustrated being flat, other embodiments of head guards can have different shapes and configurations without departing from the scope of the present disclosure. For example, some embodiments of the head guard <b>610</b> can include a lower periphery having a wave-like configuration, such that the side and rear part of the multi-layered sidewall <b>634</b> extend further from the multi-layered top panel <b>632</b> to cover a user's ears and wrap around the back of their head, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>28</b>-<b>29</b></figref>, for example.</p>
<p id="p-0075" num="0072">Headband-style head guards in accordance with the present disclosure can also incorporate a sensory input and communications system <b>698</b>.

<p id="p-0080" num="0077">In some embodiments, head guards in accordance with the present disclosure can be integrated, incorporated, coupled to, formed with, or otherwise associated with various forms of headwear. For example, head guards can be built into baseball hats, softball hats, winter hats, cowboy hats, or other types of headwear. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>26</b>A, <b>26</b>B, <b>27</b>A, and <b>27</b>B</figref> illustrate baseball hats with built-in head guards in accordance with example embodiments, each of which also includes a sensory input and communications system <b>798</b>. Referring first to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>26</b>A and <b>26</b>B</figref>, the baseball hat <b>700</b> includes a padding layer <b>702</b> that is generally convex-shaped. While the baseball hat <b>700</b> depicted in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>26</b>B</figref> does not illustrate an interior fabric layer, some embodiments can include an interior fabric layer. For example, the baseball hat <b>700</b> may be constructed with three layers, as illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>22</b></figref>, for example.</p>
<p id="p-0081" num="0078">The baseball hat <b>720</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>27</b>A-<b>27</b>B</figref> comprises a plurality of panels <b>722</b> that are stitched together to form the hat.

While the baseball hat <b>720</b> depicted in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>27</b>B</figref> does not illustrate an interior fabric layer, some embodiments can include an interior fabric layer. In some embodiments, the padding layer is discretely incorporated into the baseball hat. In other words, the baseball hat can have the general appearance of a baseball hat that does not include a padding layer. The padding layers <b>702</b> and <b>724</b> can be any suitable type of material, such as, without limitation, one or more of the materials described above with reference to padding layer <b>340</b>. As is to be appreciated, a padding layer can be incorporated (discretely or otherwise) into other types of hats, such as, golf hats, visors, cowboy hats, police hats, fireman hats, military hats or head coverings, and so forth.</p>
<p id="p-0082" num="0079">As illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>28</b>-<b>29</b></figref>, in some embodiments, a head guard can comprise a non-stick exterior surface. The head guard <b>740</b> shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>28</b></figref> comprises a multi-layer top panel <b>743</b> that is attached to (or integral with) a multi-layer lower panel <b>742</b>. Each of the multi-layer top panel <b>743</b> and the multi-layer lower panel <b>742</b> can include a padding layer, as described above. Further, the multi-layer top panel <b>743</b> has an exterior surface <b>744</b> and the multi-layer lower panel <b>742</b> has an exterior surface <b>746</b>. These exterior surfaces <b>744</b>, <b>746</b> can come in direct contact with the interior surface of a helmet, or other type of head gear, when both pieces of gear are worn by the user at the same time. Referring now to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>29</b></figref>, a head guard <b>760</b> is shown that comprises a multi-layer top panel <b>765</b> and a multi-layer side panel <b>763</b> that is attached to a multi-layer lower panel <b>762</b>. Each of the multi-layer panels <b>762</b>, <b>763</b>, <b>765</b> can include a padding layer as described above. Further, the multi-layer top panel <b>765</b> has an exterior surface <b>767</b>, the multi-layer side panel <b>763</b> has an exterior surface <b>764</b> and the multi-layer lower panel <b>762</b> has an exterior surface <b>766</b>. These exterior surfaces <b>764</b>, <b>766</b>, <b>767</b> can come in direct contact with the interior surface of a rigid helmet when both pieces of gear are worn by the same user. The head guards illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>28</b></figref> and <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>29</b></figref> are schematically shown to include a sensory input and communications system <b>798</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0083" num="0080">The exterior surfaces <b>744</b>, <b>746</b>, <b>764</b>, <b>766</b>, <b>767</b> can have non-stick (or non-slipstick) properties that generally reduces a coefficient of friction of the exterior surface of the head guard. While a variety of friction-reducing treatments or coatings can be used to provide the non-stick properties, in one example embodiment a Polytetrafluoroethylene (PTFE) treatment is used. Example PTFE treatments include the Teflon polymer products from DuPont (Teflon&#xae; PTFE fluoropolymer) and Chemfab from Saint Gobain. Beneficially, PTFE also provides repellency against oil- and waterbased stains, dust and dry oil. In some embodiments a topical application of a coating or film is used. In other embodiments, a PTFE fiber, such as a Teflon&#xae; PTFE fiber from DePont) can be integrated into the fabric (such as polyester or nylon) material mix. It is noted that in addition to other benefits, the lower panels <b>742</b>, <b>762</b> can increase the amount of exterior surface area of the head guard that is treated with the non-stick coating.</p>
<p id="p-0084" num="0081">Providing an exterior non-stick surface can be beneficial when the user wears the head guard in combination with a helmet. For example, due to the low coefficient of friction, the helmet will easily slide over top of the head guard when the user is putting on their helmet. Additionally, when the helmet receives an impact, the helmet can rotate relative to the head guard, perhaps only slightly, but thus resulting in less rotational movement for the wearer's head due to the rotational force generated by the impact. It is noted that while head guards <b>740</b> and <b>760</b> are configured to cover the top of a wearer's head, it is to be appreciated that similar configurations can be used for band-like head guards. As such, a band-like head guard can have non-stick properties and can also include a lower panel similar to those illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>28</b>-<b>29</b></figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0085" num="0082"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>30</b>-<b>33</b></figref> illustrate winter headgear incorporating head guards in accordance with various embodiments. In some embodiments, the padding layer is discretely incorporated into the winter hat.

The winter hat <b>800</b> can include chin straps <b>804</b> to secure the winter hat <b>800</b> to a wearer. The winter hat <b>800</b> can include a plurality of layers, such as an inner fur-lined layer, a middle padding layer, and an outer fabric layer. Additional insulating layers can also be used. Winter hat <b>820</b> shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>31</b></figref> is another style of winter headgear that incorporates a head guard. The head guard comprises a first padding layer <b>822</b> and a second padding layer <b>824</b>. The particular material for the first padding layer <b>822</b> and the second padding layer <b>824</b> may differ. For example, a relatively thick padding can be used for first padding layer <b>822</b> while padding having high insulating properties can be used for second padding layer <b>824</b> due to its proximity to a wearer's ears. Winter hat <b>820</b> has chin straps <b>826</b> to allow a user to securely fasten the winter hat <b>820</b> to their head.</p>

<p id="p-0110" num="0107">In some embodiments, one or more temperature sensors, or other data sources can be utilized to monitor or otherwise receive information regarding the ambient temperature, precipitation, and/or other weather conditions in which the wearer of the head guard <b>1510</b> is experiencing. For instance, one or more sensors <b>1560</b> of the head guard <b>1510</b> can sense the ambient temperature information and provide such information to the mobile communications device <b>1520</b>, either for local processing or for delivery to the activity monitoring computing system <b>1530</b>. Additionally or alternatively, the mobile communications device <b>1520</b> can utilize a weather software application executing on the mobile communications device <b>1520</b>, or other technique for data retrieval (i.e., API calls to a weather data feed) to receive the current temperature and/or other atmospheric conditions (precipitation, visibility, wind, etc.). Furthermore, the activity monitoring computing system <b>1530</b> can ascertain the weather conditions associated with the head guard <b>1510</b>, such as through obtaining weather conditions for the geographic location in which the head guard <b>1510</b> is being used based on GPS coordinates, or otherwise. For instance, the head guard <b>1510</b> can be registered to a player in a particular geographic region so the activity monitoring computing system <b>1530</b> can poll a weather data source for weather-related data for that geographic region. The weather condition data can be used by the mobile communications device <b>1520</b> and/or the activity monitoring computing system <b>1530</b> for any suitable processing function. For instance, the weather condition data can be used as additional input for assessing effect of impacts or other types of monitored events, especially if certain types of injuries may be more prevalent in certain weather conditions. This data can be used, for example, to examine or determine potential correlations between monitored events and weather conditions, weather patterns, or other weather-related information that the wearer was experiencing at the time of the monitored event (i.e., heat exhaustion, injury, or otherwise).</p>
<p id="p-0111" num="0108">The sensory input and communications system <b>1598</b> can also include a power source <b>1562</b>, which can be, for example, a battery, a solar-energy source, any other suitable power supply. The power source <b>1562</b> can also leverage power harvesting techniques such as body heat, solar power, kinetic energy derived from sports activities, etc. to generate power to operate the sensory input and communications system <b>1598</b>. In some embodiments, the power source <b>1562</b> can be wirelessly rechargeable, with electromagnetic fields of a charging unit transferring power from the charging unit to the power source <b>1562</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0112" num="0109">The sensory input and communications system <b>1598</b> can also include a microcontroller <b>1564</b> for receiving outputs from the sensors <b>1560</b>A, <b>1560</b>B . . . <b>1560</b>B. The microcontroller <b>1564</b> can be in communication with a communication unit <b>1566</b>, which can be, for example, a BLUETOOTH communications module. The communication unit <b>1566</b> can include any type of transmitter, transceiver, and/or antenna to enable suitable communication. In some embodiments the communication unit <b>1566</b> can operate utilizing one or more communication protocols, such as LTE, Wi-Fi, radio frequency, and so forth. In some cases, signal strength and data traffic is considered to determine which communication to use during a particular sporting event. The antenna(s) of the communication unit <b>156</b> can be multi-band to support one or more of following frequencies: Bluetooth wireless technology: 400 MHZ: 400-450, 600 MHz: 608-614, 900 MHZ: 950-956, ZigBee 902-928 MHZ, ZigBee: 2400-2483.5 MHZ, UWB: 3168-10560 MHZ, NFC: 13.56 MHZ, Global Navigation Satellite Systems: GPS 1565-1585 MHZ, DVB-H: 1670-1675 MHz, WiMax: 2300-3800 MHZ, GSM/UMTS: 850-2170 MHZ single and multi-band, LTE: 700-3700 MHZ multi band, 4900-5875 MHZ. Furthermore, various components of the communication unit <b>1566</b>, such as an antenna, can be made through laser direct structuring, molded interconnected devices, and other technologies for 3D antenna. The antenna can also be an energy harvesting antenna that converts various electromagnetic fields to energy that can be utilized by the power source <b>1562</b>. In some embodiments, the sensors <b>1560</b>A, <b>1560</b>B . . . <b>1560</b>N themselves can communicate directly with the mobile communications device <b>1520</b>. Furthermore, a variety of communication techniques can be used, such as 900 MHz wireless transmissions.</p>
<p id="p-0113" num="0110">The sensory input and communications system <b>1598</b> can also include a local indicator <b>1580</b> that provides one or more indications when certain events are detected. For instance, local indicator <b>1580</b> can be a visual and/or audio device that is activated by the microcontroller <b>1564</b> when an impact event of a predefined magnitude is detected. Such local indicator <b>1580</b> can therefore provide the wearer, a referee, or other observer an indication that a certain type of event has been detected. In some embodiments, the output of the local indicator <b>1580</b> can vary depending on impact, or other factors. For instance, an impact at a first level may cause the local indicator <b>1580</b> to illuminate yellow and/or flash slowly while a much greater impact may cause the local indicator <b>1580</b> to illuminate red and/or quickly, and so forth. The output of the local indicator <b>1580</b> can be specific or customized to the athlete such that specific thresholds for impact, per sport, per age group, per gender can be implemented.</p>
<p id="p-0114" num="0111">Further, while the local indicator <b>1580</b> is depicted as being in communication with the microcontroller <b>1564</b>, this disclosure is not so limited. In some embodiments, alternative to a microcontroller-controlled local indicator or in addition to a microcontroller-controlled local indicator, the local indicator <b>1580</b> of the head guard <b>1510</b> can be a non-powered indicator that provides real-time impact visualization. For instance, the local indicator <b>1580</b> can be a color changing gel that changes color with impact (through heat); as heat is generated byproduct of an impact. The severity or level of impact can generate different colors to indicate impact severity (Green/Yellow/Red). Example gels include thermochromic gels, and other color changing gels that are impact activated. The gels can reset momentarily, returning to its original color and will activate again upon impact. This type of local indicator <b>1580</b> can be placed in front, side or back of the headgear and be viewable through a viewing port on the head guard <b>1510</b>, for example.</p>
<p id="p-0115" num="0112"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>46</b></figref> depicts an example user interface <b>1568</b> that can be provided on a display of the mobile communications device <b>1520</b> depicted in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>45</b></figref>. Referring now to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>45</b>-<b>46</b></figref>, an exemplary non-limiting operational example will now be described. The head guard <b>1510</b> can be placed on the head of an athlete. The head guard <b>1510</b> can be linked to the mobile communications device <b>1520</b> through any suitable communications protocol using the network <b>1550</b>A (such as a personal area network (PAN)). In some embodiments, a user of the mobile communications device <b>1520</b> can provide wearer data <b>1570</b>, such as weight, height, age, activity, and so forth. Such data can be used to determine various performance/monitoring metrics, such as impact thresholds or ranges. Such metrics can be stored locally on the mobile communications device <b>1520</b> or retrieved from the centralized activity monitoring computing system <b>1530</b>. In some embodiments, one or more algorithms can be used to determine the individual impact and temperature thresholds to determine risk levels for head trauma, and heat stroke, and other diagnostic based on captured or inputted athlete data (e.g., athlete's weight, age, height, and sport). The user interface <b>1568</b> can also indicate that the head guard is currently being monitored at status indicator <b>1572</b>. Additional information <b>1574</b> can also be tracked and/or provided through the user interface <b>1568</b>. The data can be information that was collected by one or more of the sensors <b>1560</b>A, <b>1560</b>B . . . <b>1560</b>N, provided to the microcontroller <b>1564</b>, and subsequently transmitted to the mobile communications device <b>1520</b>. The data can be visualized by the user interface <b>1568</b>, and in some cases, trends can be identified or determined. Such data can include, without limitation, duration of activity, distance traveled, temperature, brain activity, heart rate, respiration, impact events (location, magnitude), head rotation, sweat rate, images (still images, video), speed, and so forth. Visualization of the data can also include reconstruction of various impact events based on data collected from multiple sensors for one or more head guards involved with the event. For instance, 3-D modeling can be utilized to visually depict impact events for one or more head guards collecting data during the event. In some embodiments, if certain event thresholds are met, various alerts or notices can be provided to the user interface <b>1568</b> or sent to other recipient devices via other means (e.g., as email account, text messages, social media messages, instant messages). Such event thresholds can be based on, for example, impacts received, length of activity, temperature, distance traveled, and so forth. The alert or notice can be, for example, a graphical notice, an auditory notice, or combination of both.</p>
<p id="p-0116" num="0113"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>47</b></figref> depicts another system diagram of an example activity monitoring computing system <b>1630</b>. The activity monitoring computing system <b>1630</b> can be in direct or indirect communication with a plurality of head guards <b>1610</b>A, <b>1610</b>B . . . <b>1610</b>N through a communication network <b>1650</b>. Each of the head guards <b>1610</b>A, <b>1610</b>B . . . <b>1610</b>N can be electronically linked, such as through a personal area network (PAN), to a respectively linked portable electronic device <b>1620</b>A, <b>1620</b>B . . . <b>1620</b>N. In one embodiment, each of the linked portable electronic devices <b>1620</b>A, <b>1620</b>B . . . <b>1620</b>N is configured to provide various information to the activity monitoring computing system <b>1630</b> for data collection and subsequent processing by the activity monitoring computing system <b>1630</b>. Such data can be transmitted in real-time, substantially real time, periodically, or based on a request from the activity monitoring computing system <b>1630</b>. In some embodiments, all of the data collected by the sensor input and communications systems <b>1698</b>A, <b>1698</b>B . . . <b>1698</b>N of each of the head guards <b>1610</b>A, <b>1610</b>B . . . <b>1610</b>C can be provided to the activity monitoring computing system <b>1630</b>. In other embodiments, a subset of the collected data can be provided. The activity monitoring computing system <b>1630</b> can include, similar to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>45</b></figref>, a processor <b>1644</b>, an app server <b>1646</b>, a web server <b>1644</b>, and various databases <b>1626</b>, <b>1627</b>, <b>1628</b>. The activity monitoring computing system <b>1630</b> can also include a memory unit <b>1624</b> that can store instructions for various engines, such as a reporting engine <b>1670</b> and an analytics engine <b>1672</b>. The activity monitoring computing system <b>1630</b> can, for example, provide aggregate reporting based on data received from a plurality of head guards <b>1610</b>A, <b>1610</b>B . . . <b>1610</b>N. While the aggregate reporting can vary, example types of reports can include impacts levels per sport for a particular age group, activity levels per age group in a particular geographic area, and so forth. Additionally, the activity monitoring computing system <b>1630</b> and/or the linked portable electronic device <b>1620</b>A, <b>1620</b>B . . . <b>1620</b>N can track and store data for individual athletes or groups of athletes (e.g., teams).</p>
<p id="p-0117" num="0114"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>48</b></figref> schematically depicts a first head guard <b>1710</b>A and a second head guard <b>1710</b>B impacting during an athletic endeavor, with the impact being depicted as impact event <b>1700</b>. While two head guards are depicted in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>48</b></figref>, it is to be appreciated that various impact events <b>1700</b> can involve more than two head guards. As a result of the impact event <b>1700</b>, sensors associated with a sensory input and communication system <b>1798</b>A of the first head guard <b>1710</b>A and sensors associated with a sensory input and communication system <b>1798</b>B of the second head guard <b>1710</b>B will generate various types of data. The data can be provided to the linked portable electronic devices <b>1720</b>A and <b>1720</b>B, respectively. In some embodiments, various data can also be exchanged between the first head guard <b>1710</b>A and the second head guard <b>1710</b>B via a datalink <b>1702</b>. Using data received from each of the sensory input and communication systems <b>1798</b>A and <b>1798</b>B, an activity monitoring computing system <b>1730</b> can provide appropriate correlation of the hits in regards to other player. For example if two players collide head on, the impact to both players would be assessed from a variety of metrics including each of the players speed/acceleration before impact, based on the data collected by their respective head guards <b>1710</b>A and <b>1710</b>B. The profile of each player (i.e., height, weight, etc.) can also assist with creating a full picture of data collected during the impact event <b>1700</b>. Thus, the activity monitoring computing system <b>1730</b> can track the impact received to the first head guard <b>1710</b>A and detect that the athlete wearing the head guard <b>1710</b>B delivered the impact. The wearer data (i.e. wearer data <b>570</b> shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>46</b></figref>) of that athlete can be used by the activity monitoring computing system <b>1730</b> for processing.</p>
<p id="p-0118" num="0115">Example data that can be tracked, stored, or otherwise processed by head guards in accordance with the present disclosure includes, without limitation, active minutes, top speed, impacts received, location of impacts, severity of impacts, average temperature, etc. Such data can be collected, gathered or presented over certain time frames, such as over a season, over a career, over a school year, over a tournament, over a game, and so forth. In some embodiments, the data collected can be reviewed and processed in the aggregate (e.g., using &#x2018;big data&#x2019; approaches), and in other embodiments relatively small subsets of the data can be used for processing and review. In some embodiments, artificial intelligence, neural networks, or other types of learning networks can mine data collected from a plurality of head guards, as well as other sources, to extrapolate various information or datasets. In some embodiments, object tracking of the video data collected from the head guard (or from other source(s)) can be used in combination with data and metrics received from onboard sensors of one or more head guards. Using machine learning, or other computing platforms, various data regarding impact, acceleration/deceleration, mass, direction of individual and team players, and location of players can be correlated to various events (i.e., impact events) across a plurality of datasets.</p>
<p id="p-0119" num="0116">Head guards in accordance with the presently disclosed embodiments may be manufactured using a variety of manufacturing techniques, such as ultrasonic welding, stitching, gluing, and/or quilting, for example. Stitching can be used to couple an interior fabric layer to an external fabric layer to create a pocket to house the padding layer. In some embodiments, double needle stitching is utilized to attach various components of the head guard. With a double stitching technique, twin needles create parallel double stitching using two needles mounted in a plastic holder. A standard needle shank is added to the plastic holder so it can be inserted in the needle holder on the sewing machine. One needle can be shorter than the other so that a bobbin can catch both stitches. The head guards can be manufactured in different sizes so that they can accommodate both children head sizes and adult head sizes.</p>
<p id="p-0120" num="0117">The head guards disclosed herein can be used in a wide variety of endeavors, either as standalone units or in combination with existing protective gear, including both activities involving contact and non-contacting activities. Example applications include, without limitation, mixed martial arts, boxing, paintball, lacrosse, racquetball, water polo, ice skating, roller skating, water skiing, wind surfing, surfing, wrestling, rock climbing, ice hockey, roller hockey, basketball, soccer, wrestling masks, motocross, auto racing, cricket, BMX racing, parkour, and volleyball. Additional applications can include, without limitation, rodeo (for both riders and clowns), track &#x26; field events, cross-country running, hang gliding, bobsledding, and luge, for example. Other applications for the head guards described herein include, for example, skiing, snowboarding, skateboarding, rugby, polo, equestrian sports, martial arts, and base jumping. In some embodiments, the head guard may be worn as a component under the athlete's helmet. In some embodiments, the head guard may be incorporated into the athlete's apparel. In some embodiments, the head guard can be worn over top of a sporting helmet. In some embodiments, the head guard can be worn without a helmet.</p>
<p id="p-0121" num="0118">When a head guard is worn under a helmet (such as a football helmet, hockey helmet, bicycle helmet, and the like), an impact delivered to the wearer's head may be reduced as compared to receiving the impact when wearing the rigid helmet without a head guard. When tested in general accordance with to the National Operating Committee of Standards for Athletic Equipment (NOCSAE) Documner (ND) 002-11m12, a head guard worn in combination with various types of football helmets can dissipate an impact force applied to the helmet as measured by severity index. For example, a severity index of an impact to a helmet can be higher than the severity index of the same impact delivered to the rigid helmet worn in combination with a head guard. Such impact dissipation can also occur when worn in combination with other helmets, such as lacrosse helmets, hockey helmets, and batting helmets in accordance with ND 041-11m12, ND 030-11m12, and ND 022-10m12, respectively. Such impact dissipation can also occur when worn in combination with other types of helmets, such as ski helmets, for example. As described herein, head guards in accordance with the present disclosure do not necessarily have to be worn in combination with a helmet. For such uses, an impact delivered to the wearer's head while wearing a head guard may be reduced as compared to receiving the impact when not wearing a head guard. Moreover, head guards in accordance with the present disclosure do not necessarily have to be worn with rigid helmets but can be worn in connection with baseball hats or other types of non-rigid hats. For such uses, an impact delivered to the wearer's head may be reduced as compared to receiving the impact when wearing the non-rigid hat without a head guard.</p>
<p id="p-0122" num="0119">The particular combination of materials for the various layers of head guards manufactured in accordance with the systems and methods described herein can vary. Below are some non-limiting examples of material combinations. As is to be readily appreciated, other combinations are envisioned and are within the scope of the present disclosure. For some head guards, one or more layers can comprise about 80-90% polyester or Nylon and about 10-20% Spandex or Elastene. In one embodiment, one or more layers can comprise about 86% polyester and about 14% Spandex. One or more layers can also be a mesh-type material for increased breathability and ventilation. The layers of the head guard can have various fabric weights. In some embodiments, the fabric weight of an outer or inner lay can be in the range of about 5 to about 12 ounces, for example.</p>
<p id="p-0123" num="0120">In some embodiments, one or more of the fabric layers can comprise about 60% polyester and about 40% cotton. In one embodiment, one or more fabric layers can comprise about 100% cotton. In one embodiment, one or more fabric layers can comprise about 80% polyester and about 20% spandex. In one embodiment, one or more fabric layers can comprise about 90% polyester and about 10% Spandex. In one embodiment, one or more fabric layers can comprise about 86% polyester and about 14% Spandex. In some embodiments, one or more fabric layers can comprise about 100% acrylic. In one embodiment, one or more layers can comprise about 85% acrylic and about 15% nylon.</p>
<p id="p-0124" num="0121">In some embodiments, one or more fabric layers can comprise about 100% cotton. In one embodiment, one or more fabric layers can comprise about 80% cotton and about 20% polyester. Furthermore, various head guards can be manufactured from colored materials, dyed particular colors, or manufactured with glow in the dark and/or reflective materials.</p>
<p id="p-0125" num="0122">In various embodiments disclosed herein, a single component may be replaced by multiple components and multiple components may be replaced by a single component to perform a given function or functions. Except where such substitution would not be operative, such substitution is within the intended scope of the embodiments. While various embodiments have been described herein, it should be apparent that various modifications, alterations, and adaptations to those embodiments may occur to persons skilled in the art with attainment of at least some of the advantages. The disclosed embodiments are therefore intended to include all such modifications, alterations, and adaptations without departing from the scope of the embodiments as set forth herein.</p>
