<heading id="h-0001" level="1">FIELD OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0002" num="0001">The present description relates to improvements in systems, methods and devices for use in the aquaculture farming environment.</p>
<heading id="h-0002" level="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">Conventional devices exist for attaching a basket to a longline. Such devices are cumbersome to interact with, and involve a significant amount of manual resources during harvesting or maintenance operations. Occasionally, when one basket become defective for whatever reason, the needed replacement of the damaged basket becomes problematic since an entire section of baskets might need to be replaced just to replace the damaged basket. Not only is there significant manual labour involved, but added expense in replacement of basket(s), or parts of baskets, that might need replacement themselves. Accordingly, there exists a need to provide an improved system, device, and method less prone to the shortcomings of conventional systems and devices.</p>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">It will be clearly understood that, if a prior art publication is referred to herein, this reference does not constitute an admission that the publication forms part of the common general knowledge in the art in Australia or in any other country.</p>
<heading id="h-0003" level="1">SUMMARY</heading>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">The present disclosure generally relates to a system, device and method for attaching an aquatic basket to a longline or other structure in an aquatic farming environment. It will be understood that when the term &#x201c;longline&#x201d; is used herein, other structures such as a trestle or ladder are envisioned for use with embodiments described below. In one or more preferred embodiments, there is described a locking bar which interacts with the basket and an engagement mechanism that attaches to the longline. The locking bar and engagement mechanism may be configured for use with a variety of situations, such as, but not limited to, use with one or more basket floats and/or basket clips. The locking bar and engagement mechanism may be configured for a variety of orientations so that the length of the basket is generally parallel to the longline, or at another angle, for example, perpendicular to the longline as desired for the needed situation.</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">The present disclosure in one preferred aspect provides for a system for attaching an aquatic basket to a longline in an aquaculture farming environment. The system comprises an aquaculture basket configured to hold aquatic life therein, the basket having a first end, a second end opposite the first end, an upper surface, a lower surface, and a length from the first end to the second end, the upper surface including at least one aperture oriented along the length. The system further comprises a longline engagement means configured to hold the basket to the longline. The system also further comprises a locking bar configured for slidable engagement with at least one aperture of the upper surface of the basket and a portion of the longline engagement means to releasably secure the basket to the longline engagement means.</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">In another preferred aspect, the present disclosure provides for a quick release for engaging an aquaculture basket to a float and a longline. The quick release comprises an upper body portion including a through-aperture configured to receive at least a portion of the longline therethrough. The upper body portion comprises an engagement means configured to secure to the float a lower body portion configured to slidably receive a portion of a locking bar to secure the basket to the lower body portion.</p>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">In a further preferred aspect, the present disclosure provides for a quick release for engaging an aquaculture basket to a longline. The quick release comprises a locking bar, and a basket clip including a first end configured to clip onto the longline, and a second end opposite the first end, the second end including a bottom bar. The quick release also comprises a clip lock including a curvilinear upper surface, an inwardly oriented curvilinear recess configured to receive the bottom bar of the basket clip therein, and a lower surface including an engagement means configured to slidably receive the locking bar.</p>
<p id="p-0009" num="0008">In yet another preferred aspect, the present disclosure provides a method for attaching an aquatic basket to a longline in an aquaculture farming environment. The method comprises attaching an engagement means to the longline; positioning the basket proximate the engagement means; and sliding a locking bar through the engagement means to secure the basket to the engagement means.</p>
<p id="p-0010" num="0009">In another preferred aspect, the present disclosure provides for an apparatus for aquaculture farming. The apparatus comprises a piece of durable material which is deformable so as to substantially create an enclosure such as a basket for housing a farmed aquaculture species. The piece of durable material comprises engagement means so that a first part of the durable material can engage with a second part thereof and thereby retain the durable material in the desired deformed state, substantially as an enclosure. The shape of the durable material is such that once in the enclosure form, there are no gaps between engaged parts which are sufficiently large enough to allow an individual of the farmed aquaculture species from exiting the enclosure.</p>
<p id="p-0011" num="0010">In a further preferred aspect, the present disclosure provides for an assembly for attaching an aquaculture basket to a longline. The assembly comprises a plurality of pre-formed thermoplastic components which are together operable to facilitate rotation of the basket in at least two planes.</p>
<p id="p-0012" num="0011">In yet another preferred aspect, the present disclosure provides an elongate member for attachment to and along the axis of an aquaculture basket to provide rigidity and support to the basket.</p>
<p id="p-0013" num="0012">It is to be understood that both the foregoing general description and the following detailed description are exemplary and explanatory only and are not restrictive of the invention, as claimed. In the present specification and claims, the word &#x201c;comprising&#x201d; and its derivatives including &#x201c;comprises&#x201d; and &#x201c;comprise&#x201d; include each of the stated integers, but does not exclude the inclusion of one or more further integers. It will be appreciated that reference herein to &#x201c;preferred&#x201d; or &#x201c;preferably&#x201d; is intended as exemplary only. The claims as filed and attached with this specification are hereby incorporated by reference into the text of the present description.</p>
<p id="p-0014" num="0013">The accompanying drawings, which are incorporated in and constitute a part of this specification, illustrate several embodiments of the invention and together with the description, serve to explain the principles of the invention.</p>

In the present specification and claims, the word &#x201c;comprising&#x201d; and its derivatives including &#x201c;comprises&#x201d; and &#x201c;comprise&#x201d; include each of the stated integers, but does not exclude the inclusion of one or more further integers. It will be appreciated that reference herein to &#x201c;preferred&#x201d; or &#x201c;preferably&#x201d; is intended as exemplary only. The claims as filed and attached with this specification are hereby incorporated by reference into the text of the present description.</p>
<p id="p-0039" num="0038">The present disclosure in one preferred aspect provides for a system for attaching an aquatic basket to a longline in an aquaculture farming environment. The system comprises an aquaculture basket configured to hold aquatic life therein. The basket is suitable for a wide range of farmed aquatic life, for example sea urchins, scallops, oysters and other shellfish. In this aspect the basket has a first end, a second end opposite the first end, an upper surface, a lower surface, and a length from the first end to the second end, the upper surface including at least one aperture oriented along the length. The system further comprises a longline engagement means configured to hold the basket to the longline. The system also further comprises a locking bar configured for engagement with at least one aperture of the upper surface of the basket and a portion of the longline engagement means to releasably secure the basket to the longline engagement means. The locking bar may engage with the basket and the longline engagement means in any suitable way. In some embodiments, it slidably engages with both so as to releasably lock the basket to the longline engagement means. In some embodiments, it may comprise a latch mechanism which may for example comprise one or more deformable components which deform so as to enable latch together.</p>
<p id="p-0040" num="0039">In some embodiments the longline engagement means comprises: an upper body portion including a through-aperture configured to receive at least a portion of the longline therethrough; and a lower body portion configured to receive a portion of said locking bar (for example, slidably receive) to secure the basket to said lower body portion. The longline engagement means may also be configured to be engageable to a basket float.</p>
<p id="p-0041" num="0040">In some embodiments, the longline engagement means is configured to permit disengagement of the basket while remaining engaged to the float. It will be appreciated that in some embodiments, it is configured to permit disengagement of the float while remaining engaged to the basket. In some embodiments, the longline engagement means is configured to be located between the float and the basket when the basket and float are engaged to it.</p>
<p id="p-0042" num="0041">Some preferred embodiments comprise a plurality of longline engagement means configured for engagement with the locking bar to releasably secure the basket to the longline at a plurality of locations.</p>
<p id="p-0043" num="0042">In some preferred embodiments, the longline engagement means comprises a basket clip and separate clip lock engageable with one another. The clip lock may be configured to slidably receive a portion of said locking bar along a bottom surface of said clip lock to entrap said clip between said locking bar and said clip lock. The clip lock may also comprise a recess configured to receive a lower portion of the basket clip therein.</p>
<p id="p-0044" num="0043">In another preferred aspect, the present disclosure provides for a quick release for engaging an aquaculture basket to a float and a longline. The quick release comprises an upper body portion including a through-aperture configured to receive at least a portion of the longline therethrough. The upper body portion comprises an engagement means configured to secure to the float a lower body portion configured to slidably receive a portion of a locking bar to secure the basket to the lower body portion.</p>
<p id="p-0045" num="0044">In some embodiments, the lower body portion is oriented transverse to said upper body portion so that the basket is secured to the longline with its length perpendicular to the longline. In some embodiments, the lower body portion is oriented parallel to said upper body portion so that the basket is secured to the longline with its length parallel with the longline. The upper and lower body portions in some embodiments each have an overall length that is substantially equal. The through aperture of the upper body portion may in some embodiments have a complete perimeter so that the longline is strung through the quick release to engage the quick release to the longline. In other embodiments, the upper body portion may engage the longline in another suitable manner, provided that it is secure so that the basket does not become inadvertently detached from the longline.</p>
<p id="p-0046" num="0045">In a further preferred aspect, the present disclosure provides for a quick release for engaging an aquaculture basket to a longline. The quick release comprises a locking bar, and a basket clip including a first end configured to clip onto the longline, and a second end opposite the first end, the second end including a bottom bar. The quick release also comprises a clip lock including a curvilinear upper surface, an inwardly oriented curvilinear recess configured to receive the bottom bar of the basket clip therein, and a lower surface including an engagement means configured to slidably receive the locking bar. The dimensions of the components of the quick bar should be sufficient so as to be robust and reduce the effect of wear and tear up on them by floating material (such as sand) in the surrounding water. A further advantage of a robust quick release according to this aspect is that it is less subject to wear than traditional attachment means and is readily replaceable once wear eventually becomes an issue.</p>
<p id="p-0047" num="0046">In some embodiments the locking bar has a length approximately equal to a length of the basket. The first end of the basket clip may be hook-shaped, This enables ready engagement with and conformity with the shape of the long line whilst enabling free movement for the basket to swing back and forth on the longline to increase rumbling. In some embodiments the first and second ends of the basket clip each comprise a through hole having a central axis that are parallel to one another. In some embodiments, the lower surface of the clip lock comprises a plurality of feet configured to engage with a locking bar. The lower surface of the clip lock may be configured to slidably receive said locking bar in a transverse orientation relative to the longline. The lower surface of the clip lock may also be configured to slidably receive the locking bar in a parallel orientation relative to the longline. Other methods of attaching the clip lock to the basket are also within the scope of this disclosure.</p>
<p id="p-0048" num="0047">In yet another preferred aspect, the present disclosure provides a method for attaching an aquatic basket to a longline in an aquaculture farming environment. The method comprises attaching an engagement means to the longline; positioning the basket proximate the engagement means; and sliding a locking bar through the engagement means to secure the basket to the engagement means.</p>
<p id="p-0049" num="0048">In some embodiments, the step of sliding the locking bar through the engagement means comprises sliding the locking bar through a plurality of engagement means. The step of sliding the locking bar through the engagement means may also comprise sliding the locking bar through an engagement means that is secured to a float. In some embodiments, the method comprises disengaging the basket from the float while keeping the float engaged to the longline. In some embodiments, the method comprises flipping the basket about the longline. The method may comprise flipping the basket about the longline so that a length of the basket is flipped around the longline. It also may comprise flipping the basket about the longline while the float is engaged with the longline and cage.</p>
<p id="p-0050" num="0049">In another preferred aspect, the present disclosure provides for an apparatus for aquaculture farming. The apparatus comprises a piece of durable material which is foldable or deformable so as to substantially create an enclosure such as a basket for housing the farmed aquaculture species. The piece of durable material comprises engagement means so that a first part of the durable material can engage with a second part thereof and thereby retain the durable material in the desired deformed state, substantially as an enclosure. The shape of the durable material is such that once in the enclosure form, there are no gaps between engaged parts which are sufficiently large enough to allow an individual of the farmed aquaculture species from exiting the enclosure. Such gaps are present in prior art devices and form &#x2018;siphons&#x2019; through which farmed aquaculture species can escape or exit the basket along with water flow through the gaps.</p>
<p id="p-0051" num="0050">The piece of durable material may be of any suitable shape, but is preferably a sheet which is substantially rectangular in shape so as to enable it to be rolled into a substantially cylindrical form of enclosure. By providing the material as a flat sheet costs can be reduced in terms of production, transport and storage (for example by flat packing the product). The durable material may be of any suitable type and is preferably durable in a marine environment and so may for example comprise a plastic such as polypropylene. The engagement means of the piece of durable material may comprise any suitable components. In some simple yet preferred components it comprises male and female parts for interlocking, such as a tab and slot arrangement.</p>
<p id="p-0052" num="0051">The apparatus according to this aspect preferably comprises one or more caps to close any gaps left after deforming the durable material into the enclosure form. In a preferred embodiment, the enclosure is substantially cylindrical and preferably with a substantially ovoid cross section. In such an embodiment, the apparatus comprises two caps, one for each end of the enclosure. It will be appreciated that the attachment of the caps as described herein preferably also affords no gaps which are sufficiently large enough to allow an individual of the farmed aquaculture species from exiting the enclosure. Other configurations are also contemplated in the present disclosure, for example a piece of durable material that is deformable or foldable so as to form the entire enclosure or basket, so that no caps are required. Again, this may be in any suitable enclosure or basket shape, but a preferable shape would be a cylinder with an ovoid cross section. The piece of durable material before folding or deformation would comprise a rectangle shape with a substantially ovoid section at each of the shorter ends which will, once folded each comprise the end caps.</p>
<p id="p-0053" num="0052">In a further preferred aspect, the present disclosure provides for an assembly for attaching an aquaculture basket to a longline. The assembly comprises a plurality of pre-formed components which are together operable to facilitate rotation of the basket in at least two planes. By enabling rotational movement across multiple planes the assembly of this aspect of the disclosure enables enhanced movement of the aquaculture basket and therefore better rumbling. The assembly is preferably made from a durable material that is suitable for use in an environment of prolonged exposure to a marine environment. The at least two planes of rotation may be of any suitable orientation. In some preferred embodiments they are perpendicular to each other, though they do not have to be.</p>
<p id="p-0054" num="0053">In yet another preferred aspect, the present disclosure provides an elongate member for attachment to and along the axis of an aquaculture basket to provide rigidity and support to the basket. The elongate member may be attached to the aquaculture basket in any suitable way. In some embodiments, it may simply clip on to the basket. In other embodiments, it may comprise a locking bar described herein and for example may be threaded through locking apertures or other engagement means of the basket. It may for example additionally be used to releasably engage other components to the basket such as a quick release, a clip lock, a float, an assembly, or any other apparatus which may usefully be attached to the basket. The elongate member preferably is sufficiently wide so as to provide shade for the aquaculture species being farmed within the basket and is preferably sufficiently structurally rigid so as to provide additional rigidity to the basket. Some embodiments comprise an elongate member which attaches to the basket without use of a locking bar (for example with clips or some other means) and is engageable with a separate locking bar as herein described and preferably engages with the locking bar in the same way. An elongate member according to this aspect (whether or not it comprises or is a locking bar) may in some preferred embodiments comprise a plurality and preferably more than two locations for attachment of other components.</p>
<p id="p-0055" num="0054">Reference will now be made in detail to the present preferred embodiments of the invention, examples of which are illustrated in the accompanying drawings.</p>
<p id="p-0056" num="0055"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>1</b> to <b>5</b></figref> show a preferred embodiment of a system <b>100</b> for attaching an aquatic basket <b>102</b> to a longline in an aquaculture farming environment. System <b>100</b> includes a longline engagement means, in the embodiment illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>1</b>-<b>5</b></figref>, in the form of a clip assembly <b>104</b>, which is engaged with the basket <b>102</b> via a locking bar <b>106</b> that is slidably received in a plurality of loops <b>108</b>. Sliding locking bar <b>106</b> through loops <b>108</b> not only secures the basket in a rolled, substantially ovoid cross sectioned form (to be described further below), but also engages the clip to the basket to attach the basket to the longline. BY sliding locking bar <b>106</b> out of loops <b>108</b> a user can disengage basket <b>102</b> from clip assembly <b>104</b>, and therefore, detach it from the longline in an efficient and expeditious manner. The preferred elements of the system and their interrelationship are described below.</p>
<p id="p-0057" num="0056">Referring to now to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref>, basket <b>102</b> is preferably formed from a sheet <b>110</b> of mesh material <b>112</b> which can be of any suitable marine-durable material, but is preferably a plastic such as polypropylene. Sheet <b>110</b> includes a first end <b>114</b>, a second end <b>116</b>, a first side <b>118</b>, a second side <b>120</b>, and a centre portion <b>122</b>. At least one, more preferably, a plurality of loop apertures <b>124</b> are arrayed along first side <b>118</b>. Each loop aperture <b>124</b> is sized and configured to engage with a corresponding loop <b>108</b> when sheet <b>110</b> is deformed or rolled into the basket configuration. Second side <b>120</b> of sheet <b>110</b> includes at least one, more preferably, a plurality of loops <b>108</b> arrayed there along. Centre portion <b>122</b> is preferably configured so that when sheet <b>110</b> is rolled into the basket configuration, centre portion <b>122</b> is indented along its length, or in a generally concave shape from a side cross sectional perspective. The concave configuration adds strength to the basket and promotes rumbling off contained farmed aquaculture species, such as oysters. It will be appreciated that basket <b>102</b> may be formed in a variety of ways so that the bottom of the basket is flat or even convex if desired, and depending upon the intended use. In some preferred embodiments, the basked base is concave which provides for additional strength and assists to increase oyster movement and therefore better production. Preferably the basked has a substantially ovoid cross section which promotes rumble or movement. The basket can be of any suitable volume. For example only, it can be greater or less than 15 It, and preferably approximately 20 It-40 It which enables more stock to be produced per basket than traditional basket based systems. Some preferred embodiments comprise one or marked fill lines on the basket to assist users with knowing the extent to which to fill the basket during operation.</p>
<p id="p-0058" num="0057">Once sheet <b>110</b> is rolled into the basket configuration, male locator tabs <b>123</b> fit into corresponding female tab apertures <b>125</b> to secure the sheet into the basket configuration, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref> shows an endcap <b>126</b> preferably made of a mesh material <b>128</b>. Endcap <b>126</b> includes a hinge <b>130</b> and a latch <b>132</b> opposite thereof along the width of the end cap. Endcap <b>126</b> preferably functions as a swing door when engaged to the basket body which makes it easier to use. It will be appreciated that other forms of closures may be utilised, and that the endcap as shown is only exemplary. As described elsewhere herein, in some embodiments, an endcap may be integrally formed with and is part of sheet <b>110</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0059" num="0058"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b></figref> shows locking bar <b>106</b>. Locking bar <b>106</b> has a proximal end <b>134</b>, a distal end <b>136</b>, and a length from the proximal end to the distal end. Distal end <b>136</b> includes a latch <b>138</b> having two tabs <b>140</b> that are configured to engage the locking bar in place once locking bar <b>106</b> is slid through loops <b>108</b>. The engagement of locking bar <b>106</b> with loops <b>108</b> will be described in further detail below. Proximal end <b>134</b> includes an end stop <b>142</b> to limit the insertion depth of the locking bar into the array of loops. Locking bar <b>106</b> includes a plurality of attachment points <b>144</b> configured to engage with a clip lock <b>146</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b></figref>) to secure the basket to the clip lock. The engagement of locking bar <b>106</b> with clip lock <b>146</b> will also be further described below.</p>
<p id="p-0060" num="0059"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b></figref> shows clip lock <b>146</b> preferably generally in the cross-sectional form of an arch or truncated or flattened oval. Clip lock <b>146</b> includes a curvilinear upper surface <b>148</b>, an inner recess <b>150</b> generally having a curvilinear shape to match upper exterior surface <b>148</b>, and a lower surface. The lower surface includes a plurality of tabs or engagement feet <b>154</b> sized and configured or shaped to engage with locking bar <b>106</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0061" num="0060">Referring now to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>6</b></figref>, a basket clip <b>105</b> is shown. Clip <b>105</b> includes a first end <b>156</b> generally in the shape of a hook <b>158</b> forming a first through hole <b>160</b>, and a second end <b>162</b> having a bottom bar <b>164</b>. Hook <b>158</b> includes a biased tab <b>166</b> to allow clip <b>105</b> to clip onto a longline. Bottom bar <b>164</b> preferably forms a second through hole <b>168</b> with the rest of the body of clip <b>105</b>. Through holes <b>160</b> and <b>168</b> each have a central longitudinal axis that are parallel to one another. It will be appreciated that the through holes could be oriented to be perpendicular to one another if desired. Bottom bar <b>164</b> is preferably thickened, sized and shaped to accommodate engagement with clip lock <b>146</b>. Basket Clip <b>105</b> may be of any suitable shape provided that it securely but reversibly engages the longline and allows rotation of the clip (and therefore of the basket once attached) about the axis of the longline.</p>
<p id="p-0062" num="0061"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>7</b> to <b>11</b></figref> show the engagement of locking bar <b>106</b> with loops <b>108</b>. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>7</b></figref> shows locking bar <b>106</b> with latch <b>138</b> at distal end <b>136</b>. Latch <b>138</b> includes preferably two depressible tabs <b>140</b> that are configured to latch with a latch catch <b>139</b> within latch catch loop <b>109</b> shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>7</b>A</figref>. Latch catch <b>139</b> may be formed from two internal protrusions located on the interior surface of the end loop (latch catch loop <b>109</b>). It will be appreciated that other configurations are possible to latch the locking bar with the loop without departing from the scope of the present disclosure.</p>
<p id="p-0063" num="0062"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>8</b></figref> shows locking bar <b>106</b> being slid into the array of loops along the length of the top of basket <b>102</b>. Locking bar <b>106</b> is slid distally until distal end <b>136</b> protrudes from the last loop (latch catch loop <b>109</b>) along the array, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>9</b></figref>, exposing latch <b>138</b>. End stop <b>142</b> at proximal end <b>134</b> inhibits any further movement of the locking bar into the loops as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>10</b></figref>. When the locking bar is at its most forward position so that end stop <b>142</b> is against the proximal loop, attachment points <b>144</b> are exposed between each loop <b>108</b>. In this configuration, placement of the basket and locking bar combination against and into the lower surface of clip lock <b>146</b> permits the interdigitation of feet <b>154</b> with the attachment points so that a reverse direction sliding of locking bar <b>106</b> (shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>11</b></figref>) slides over feet <b>154</b> to lock feet <b>154</b> (and therefore clip lock <b>146</b>) to the basket. Prior to sliding locking bar <b>106</b> over feet <b>154</b>, bottom bar <b>164</b> of clip <b>105</b> is inserted into inner recess <b>150</b> so that clip <b>105</b> is able to rotate relative to clip lock <b>146</b>, with bottom bar <b>164</b> being limited by curvilinear inner recess <b>150</b>. Sliding locking bar <b>106</b> over feet <b>154</b> therefore entraps bottom bar <b>164</b> within inner recess <b>150</b>, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>. Withdrawing locking bar <b>106</b> in a rearward direction disengages the locking bar from the loops and clip lock, permitting basket <b>102</b> to easily detach from the longline while keeping the clip assembly engaged to the longline.</p>
