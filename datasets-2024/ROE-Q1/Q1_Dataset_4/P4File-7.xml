<p id="p-0002" num="0001">The present disclosure relates to an aquatic-plant protein combined restructured meat and a preparation method thereof, and belongs to the technical field of processing of foods.</p>
<heading id="h-0002" level="1">BACKGROUND</heading>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">With the increasing improvement of the economic level and the living standard, the demands of residents for nutrition and health of foods are increasingly getting strong, and thus balanced diet nutrition has also become the focus of attention. High-nutrition and high-quality foods have become the goal that consumers are looking for. However, due to the influence of traditional life concepts or bad living habits, the situation of overnutrition or undernutrition is still obvious. Besides, the consumers don't have the time, money or interest to prepare high-nutrition foods from food ingredients by themselves. Therefore, it is urgent for the food industry to develop a new generation of processed foods, so as to meet the urgent needs of the consumers for easy use, low cost, nutrition and health.</p>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">As indispensable nutrients and key structural components in most foods, exogenous food proteins can effectively provide amino acids required for the growth and development of the human body, which are also the basis of synthesis of proteins in the human body. Combinations of proteins from different food sources have good gelation, a film-forming property and other surface functional properties as well as nutritional properties during application in the food industry. In particular, mixing of animal and plant proteins can improve properties of individual proteins and help to solve an environmental problem and a resource scarcity problem. However, at present, few kinds of foods about an animal and plant protein combination system are sold on the market, while dairy products, milk drinks and baked foods are mainly sold. Existing types of animal and plant protein combined foods are far from meeting the needs of the consumers for novel nutritious and healthy foods, resulting in many research and development gaps and development potential.</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">Aquatic products are high-quality protein resources, but need to be further improved in texture and functional properties. The mixing of the animal and plant proteins can improve the functional properties of products, and a protein restructuring processing technology has an obvious effect of improving the texture. In conclusion, the development of a novel nutritious and healthy combined restructured meat by the protein combined restructuring processing technology is helpful to improve the product quality, the sensory quality and nutritional and economic values.</p>
<heading id="h-0003" level="1">SUMMARY</heading>
<heading id="h-0004" level="1">Technical Problems</heading>

An enzyme and a natural small-molecule substance used are easy to obtain. A product of the prepared aquatic-plant protein combined restructured meat is expected to be produced in a large scale. A good foundation is laid for high-value utilization of animal and plant protein resources.</p>
<p id="p-0040" num="0039">(2) According to a protein pretreatment method used in the present disclosure, a complex salt is added for pickling and rolling, so that partial dissolution of actomyosin is achieved, the meat becomes relatively compact, and the flavor is improved. Convenience is provided for solving the texture problems of poor chewability and poor viscoelasticity of aquatic meat products.</p>
<p id="p-0041" num="0040">(3) According to the combined restructuring processing technology used in the present disclosure, a biological enzyme and a natural small-molecule substance are used for combination, so that reagents are green, safe, and environmentally friendly. The protease changes structural properties by acting on a peptide bond in a protein, and the natural small-molecule substance improves functional properties by crosslinking with a protein molecule. Through the combination of the two substances, restructuring of a protein is achieved, and the texture of a final product is improved. The natural small-molecule substance has excellent oxidation resistance, and can effectively improve the oxidation stability of meat products and prolong the shelf life of the meat products, thus having a broad market prospect.</p>
<p id="p-0042" num="0041">(4) The protein combined restructured meat prepared by the present disclosure contains two proteins including an animal protein and a plant protein, and has a protein content of greater than 20%, so that resources are fully utilized. While the demands for nutritional dietary proteins are met, the chewability is greater than 1,500 g&#xb7;mm, and the viscoelasticity is excellent. The meat can be processed in various shapes according to needs, directly heated for eating, or processed into a prepared food, a semi-finished product and the like, so that the product has a large application space.</p>

<p id="p-0044" num="0043">The following examples are used to illustrate the present disclosure, rather than to limit the scope of the present disclosure. All modifications or substitutions of the method, steps or conditions of the present disclosure made without departing from the spirit and essence of the present disclosure shall fall within the scope of the present disclosure.</p>
<p id="p-0045" num="0044">Unless particularly specified, experimental materials, reagents, instruments and the like used in the examples of the present disclosure are commercially available. Unless specifically specified, technical means used in the examples are conventional means well known to persons skilled in the art.</p>
<p id="p-0046" num="0045">Test methods in the following examples:</p>
<p id="p-0047" num="0046">Protein content: The protein content is determined by an automatic Kjeldahl apparatus.</p>
<p id="p-0048" num="0047">1) 0.50-1.00 g of a sample was weighed and placed in a digestion flask, two tablets made of copper sulfate and potassium sulfate were added, and 10 ml of concentrated sulfuric acid was added. The digestion flask was placed in a digestion furnace, and then connected and sealed with a connection tube. An air pumping device was started, and a power supply of the digestion furnace was turned on. After a digestion solution was completely clarified and turned into bluish green, digestion was conducted for 30 min until the sample was completely digested.</p>
<p id="p-0049" num="0048">2) The digestion flask was taken out and transferred into an automatic Kjeldahl apparatus, and relevant procedures, such as alkali addition, water addition, and distillation time, were set.</p>
<p id="p-0050" num="0049">3) After a start key was pressed, distillation titration was automatically completed by the apparatus, and the results were displayed.</p>
<p id="p-0051" num="0050">4) A digestion tube was taken out and cleanly rinsed for use in the next time.</p>
<p id="p-0052" num="0051">Full-texture test: A P20 cylindrical probe with the cross-sectional area greater than the area of a sample was selected. The running track of the probe was as follows: the probe was started in the form of auto-20 g and compressed to the test sample at a pre-test rate of 2 mm/s from a starting position; after touching the surface of the sample, the probe was compressed to the sample at a test rate of 2 mm/s with a compression ratio of 30%; and after returning to a compression trigger point and waiting for an interval of 5 s, the probe was continuously compressed down for the same distance at a rate of 2 mm/s and then returned to the position before the test at a post-test rate of 5 mm/s.</p>
<p id="p-0053" num="0052">Elasticity is expressed by the height at which the sample recovers after first compression.</p>
<p id="p-0054" num="0053">Hardness is expressed by the force at which the maximum degree of compression is reached in a first compression process.</p>
<p id="p-0055" num="0054">Cohesiveness is expressed by the ratio of the peak area in a second compression process to the peak area in the first compression process.</p>
<p id="p-0056" num="0055">Adhesion is expressed by the negative peak area in a first ascending process.</p>
<p id="p-0057" num="0056">Recoverability is expressed by the ratio of the peak area in the first ascending process to the peak area in a descending process.</p>
<p id="p-0058" num="0057">Chewability is expressed by hardness*cohesiveness*elasticity.</p>
<heading id="h-0009" level="1">Example 1</heading>
<p id="p-0059" num="0058">(1) Preparation of an aquatic protein: 500 g of frozen basa fish slices were defrosted at low temperature, cut and chopped into evenly diced meats with a size of about 0.8 cm, and soaked and cleaned in 0.6% baking soda for 8 min to obtain a meat pulp. The meat pulp was treated with a dewatering machine to remove free water, and then a protein pulp was obtained.</p>
<p id="p-0060" num="0059">(2) Preparation of a plant protein: Soybeans were crushed and sifted, and n-hexane accounting for 4 times the volume of the soybeans was added for degreasing. A degreased soybean powder was resuspended in deionized water. Next, the pH of an obtained solution was adjusted to 9.0 with sodium hydroxide, stirring was conducted at a constant temperature of 30&#xb0; C. for 2 h, centrifugation was conducted to obtain a supernatant, and the pH was adjusted to 4.0 with hydrochloric acid. The above steps were repeated for 2 times. Then, centrifugation was conducted at 8,000 rpm for 15 min, and a protein precipitate was collected and washed with deionized water until the pH was neutral. Finally, freeze-drying was conducted to obtain a soybean protein isolate.</p>
<p id="p-0061" num="0060">(3) Uniform mixing and stirring: The aquatic protein pulp obtained in step (1) and a soybean protein powder obtained in step (2) were mixed and stirred at a mass ratio of 10:1 at 4&#xb0; C. for 25 min until a homogeneous state was reached, and then a protein homogenate was obtained.</p>
<p id="p-0062" num="0061">(4) Pretreatment of a protein: A complex salt (including NaCl and phosphate) was added to the protein homogenate obtained in step (3) for pickling and rolling for 50 min, where the added amount of the NaCl was controlled to be 0.8 wt % of the weight of the protein homogenate, and the added amount of the phosphate (consisting of sodium pyrophosphate, sodium tripolyphosphate and sodium hexametaphosphate at a mass ratio of 3:5:1) was 0.4 wt % of the weight of the protein homogenate. Then food-grade sodium lactate was added for adjusting the pH to 7.5 so as to form a meat paste, and a paste protein was obtained.</p>
<p id="p-0063" num="0062">(5) Combined restructuring: 1.0 wt % of glutamine transaminase and 0.10 wt % of epigallocatechin gallate (EGCG) were added to the paste protein obtained in step (4) for uniform mixing. Next, 0.35 wt &#x2030; of monascus red (which was purchased from a local supermarket in Wuxi, and has a CAS Number of 874807-57-5) was added for uniform stirring. Then, incubation was conducted in a water bath at 50&#xb0; C. for 120 min to obtain a protein combined restructured meat, where the glutamine transaminase had an enzyme activity of 10 units/mg.</p>
<p id="p-0064" num="0063">(6) High-temperature qualitative treatment: The protein combined restructured meat obtained in step (5) was subjected to inactivation and qualitative treatment in a high-temperature water bath at 90&#xb0; C. for 10 min, and then cooling was conducted rapidly to room temperature to obtain an aquatic-plant protein combined restructured meat sample.</p>
<p id="p-0065" num="0064">(7) Integrated forming: The aquatic-plant protein combined restructured meat sample obtained in step (6) was directly kneaded in the shape of a meat pie.</p>
<p id="p-0066" num="0065">The aquatic-plant protein combined restructured meat prepared in Example 1 has high protein content, good color and lustre, moderately soft and hard taste, good elasticity, good chewability, obvious fleshy taste, good flavor and no obvious fishy taste.</p>
<heading id="h-0010" level="1">Example 2</heading>
<p id="p-0067" num="0066">With reference to Example 1, the difference was only that the soybeans in step (2) were separately substituted with mung beans, peas, black beans, kidney beans, and chickpeas. Results of properties of obtained aquatic-plant protein combined restructured meats were as shown in Table 1.</p>

<p id="p-0086" num="0079">With reference to Example 1, the difference was only that the soybeans were not additionally added. Specific operation steps were as follows.</p>
<p id="p-0087" num="0080">(1) Preparation of an aquatic protein: 500 g of frozen basa fish slices were defrosted at low temperature, cut and chopped into evenly diced meats with a size of about 0.8 cm, and soaked and cleaned in 0.6% baking soda for 8 min to obtain a meat pulp. The meat pulp was treated with a centrifuge to remove free water, and then a protein pulp was obtained.</p>
<p id="p-0088" num="0081">(4) Pretreatment of a protein: A complex salt was added to the obtained protein pulp for pickling and rolling for 50 min, where the added amount of NaCl was controlled to be 0.8% of the weight of a protein homogenate, and the added amount of phosphate was 0.4% of the weight of a protein homogenate. Then food-grade sodium lactate was added for adjusting the pH to 7.5 so as to form a meat paste.</p>
<p id="p-0089" num="0082">(5) Forming and coloring: 1.3% of glutamine transaminase and 0.10% of epigallocatechin gallate (EGCG) were added to a paste protein obtained in the above step for uniform mixing. Next, 0.35&#x2030; of monascus red was added for uniform stirring. Then, incubation was conducted in a water bath at 50&#xb0; C. for 120 min.</p>
<p id="p-0090" num="0083">(6) High-temperature qualitative treatment: A protein combined restructured meat obtained was subjected to inactivation and qualitative treatment in a high-temperature water bath at 90&#xb0; C. for 10 min, and then cooling was conducted rapidly to room temperature in an ice bath.</p>

<p id="p-0109" num="0101">From the results in Table 7, it is seen that the untreated aquatic protein meat (in Comparative Example 1) has low texture properties such as protein content, elasticity, hardness and cohesiveness, and poor chewability. The restructured meat (in Comparative Example 2) obtained after treatment by a protein processing technology has increased protein content, and the texture properties are also improved to a certain extent. However, the protein combined restructured meat (in Example 1) obtained after a plant protein is added has higher protein content, the texture properties are significantly improved, and the chewability is good.</p>
<p id="p-0110" num="0102">Through comparison between Comparative Example 3 and Comparative Example 4, it is seen that both the EGCG and the glutamine transaminase are beneficial to the improvement of protein structures. When only the EGCG is added, the effect is poor (in Comparative Example 4). When only the glutamine transaminase is used, a certain effect is achieved (in Comparative Example 3). When the two substances are used for combination (in Example 1), properties of the restructured meat are greatly improved.</p>
