<abstract id="abstract">
<p id="p-0001" num="0000">Apparatuses, systems, and methods for brewing a desired portion of a beverage, such as a single-cup portion of coffee, are provided. The system can include one or more hopper assemblies configured to provide a controlled dose of beverage material to a brew chamber. The system can also include a water input system configured to wet the ground beverage material as the grinds enter the brew chamber and substantially prevent steam from reaching grinder components of the system. Further, the system can include an automatic cleaning mechanism such that a user does not need to manually clean components of a brewing machine between brew cycles.</p>

<heading level="1" id="h-0003">Field</heading>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">The present disclosure generally relates to automated apparatuses, systems, and methods for brewing a single-cup portion of a beverage, such as coffee.</p>
<heading level="1" id="h-0004">Description of the Related Art</heading>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">Many methods and systems for brewing beverages, such as coffee, are known. In conventional coffee brewing systems, a brewing machine typically brews a relatively large batch of coffee. In commercial settings, a barista may pour cup-sized portions of coffee from the batch when a customer places an order. Such beverage brewing systems are inefficient because coffee may be wasted when not all of the coffee in the batch is ordered or consumed. In addition, such systems may produce coffee having an inconsistent flavor and taste because the coffee is not necessarily brewed when a customer places an order and may not be fresh when consumed.</p>
<heading level="1" id="h-0005">SUMMARY</heading>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">Automated single-cup coffee brewing systems may be employed to address some of the disadvantages of conventional batch-type coffee brewing systems. Users of automated single-cup coffee brewing systems would benefit from several improvements to those systems, including, but not limited to, reducing the time it takes to brew a single-cup portion or traveler portion of coffee, reducing the labor and time involved in cleaning brewing equipment between brew cycles, reducing steam and condensation from entering the grinder and hopper areas of the system to improve the quality of the coffee and to reduce corrosion on grinder components, improving the accuracy and repeatability of providing a desired dose of a beverage material (e.g., coffee beans) to a grinder portion of the system, improving agitation of coffee grounds during a brew cycle, reducing the labor and time involved in maintaining the hoppers and refilling the hoppers with beverage material, and providing an experiential brewing experience for customers.</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">Certain aspects of this disclosure are directed toward a hopper assembly for providing a controlled dose of coffee beans to a grinder. The hopper assembly can include a hopper having an upper body portion and a lower body portion. The upper and lower body portions can define an interior volume for receiving the coffee beans. The hopper assembly can also include an auger disposed at least partially within the interior volume of the hopper. The auger can include a tapered inner core and a screw thread at least partially surrounding the inner core. The screw thread can have a substantially uniform outer diameter across a length of the screw thread. The components of the hopper assembly can be disassembled without any tools to facilitate cleaning.</p>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">In the above-mentioned hopper assembly aspect, the tapered inner core can include a first portion tapered in a first direction and a second portion tapered in a second direction opposite the first direction. In certain aspects, the first and second portions are both tapered toward a central portion of the auger.</p>
<p id="p-0009" num="0008">In any of the above-mentioned hopper assembly aspects, the screw thread can include a first threaded portion and a second threaded portion. The first threaded portion can be twisted in a first direction and the second threaded portion can be twisted in a second direction opposite the first direction.</p>

<p id="p-0012" num="0011">In any of the above-mentioned hopper assembly aspects, the auger can provide a precise volume of material to the grinder based on a desired amount of a brewed beverage.</p>
<p id="p-0013" num="0012">Certain aspects of this disclosure are directed toward an apparatus for brewing a beverage. The apparatus can include a grinder assembly that can provide a controlled grind size. The grinder assembly can have a grinder outlet through which ground material can be transferred from the grinder assembly to a brew chamber. The apparatus can also include a fan in communication with the grinder outlet. The fan can provide positive pressure across the grinder outlet and toward the brew chamber. The grinder outlet can be disposed between the fan and the brew chamber. The fan and baffle can prevent moisture and ground beverage material from re-entering the grinder assembly. If wet beverage material accumulates in the grinder assembly, the grinder assembly can shut down (e.g., seize).</p>
<p id="p-0014" num="0013">In the above-mentioned apparatus aspect, the fan can be positioned above the grinder outlet, and the brew chamber can be positioned below the grinder outlet.</p>
<p id="p-0015" num="0014">In any of the above-mentioned apparatus aspects, the apparatus can include a baffle positioned between the fan and the grinder outlet.</p>
<p id="p-0016" num="0015">In any of the above-mentioned apparatus aspects, the apparatus can include a grinder cap secured to the grinder outlet. The grinder cap can include the baffle and an outlet. The baffle can be positioned along an upper portion of the grinder cap. The grinder cap outlet can be positioned along a lower portion of the grinder cap, such that the grinder outlet is disposed between the baffle and the brew chamber.</p>
<p id="p-0017" num="0016">In any of the above-mentioned apparatus aspects, the grinder can continue to grind beverage material until there is no beverage material retained in the grinder.</p>
<p id="p-0018" num="0017">Certain aspects of this disclosure are directed toward a brewing assembly for brewing coffee. The brewing assembly can include a brew chamber for receiving ground coffee and a first fluid channel that can deliver water to the brew chamber. The brewing assembly can also include a mixing valve in fluid communication with the first fluid channel. The mixing valve can include an outlet through which ground coffee can be delivered to the brew chamber. Further, the mixing valve can include a number of passageways circumferentially disposed around the outlet, each passageway can be disposed at an angle greater than 0 degrees and less than 90 degrees relative to a longitudinal axis of the mixing valve such that the water mixes with the ground coffee as the ground coffee enters the brew chamber. In certain aspects, the angle is between 10 degrees and 50 degrees. The mixing valve can wet the ground coffee immediately, consistently, and efficiently. In doing so, the level of extraction from the beverage material can be consistent from cup to cup. Further, the mixing valve can maximize the level of extraction, which can lower the total amount of beverage material necessary.</p>
<p id="p-0019" num="0018">In the above-mentioned brewing assembly aspect, the brewing assembly can include a second fluid channel that can deliver water to the brew chamber and a fill nozzle in fluid communication with the second fluid channel. In certain aspects, water delivered from the mixing valve can have a first temperature and water delivered from the fill nozzle can have a second temperature greater than the first temperature.</p>
<p id="p-0020" num="0019">In any of the above-mentioned brewing assembly aspects, the mixing valve can include a recessed portion disposed between at least one of the number of channels and the outlet.</p>
<p id="p-0021" num="0020">In any of the above-mentioned brewing assembly aspects, the mixing valve can include a wall portion separating an outer recess and an inner recess. The inner recess can include the number of passageways.</p>
<p id="p-0022" num="0021">Certain aspects of the disclosure are directed toward a beverage brewing system having an interior space including a water intake assembly.

In general, the beverage apparatus <b>2</b> can include an upper portion <b>4</b> and a lower portion <b>6</b>. The upper and lower portions <b>4</b>, <b>6</b> house the interior components described herein. For serviceability, the lower portion <b>6</b> can be easily disassembled to provide access to the brewing assembly <b>400</b>, particularly the piston <b>426</b> (see <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b>N</figref>). Further, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b>G</figref>, the upper portion <b>4</b> can move to an opened position relative to the lower portion <b>6</b> to access the interior components. As described in further detail below, in some embodiments, for user safety, the beverage apparatus can include power interlocks to shut down the machine when the upper portion <b>4</b> is in the opened position or the interior components are not fully assembled.</p>
<p id="p-0126" num="0125">The beverage apparatus <b>2</b> can be designed, in part, to reduce the amount of counter space necessary to store the apparatus. For example, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b>B</figref>, the hopper assemblies <b>300</b>, the controls <b>60</b>, <b>80</b>, the waste bin <b>422</b>, the dispenser assembly <b>110</b>, and the base portion <b>16</b> can be generally longitudinally aligned to reduce the width of the beverage apparatus <b>2</b>. Further, each of the hopper assemblies <b>300</b> can have a narrow width, such that the beverage apparatus <b>2</b> can include a multiple number of hopper assemblies <b>300</b> without excessively increasing the width of the beverage apparatus <b>2</b>. The longitudinally aligned design also facilitates the general downward flow of beverage material and fluid to reduce the length of the brew cycle. Further, to improve the customer experience, the hoppers assemblies <b>300</b> can include one or more transparent walls so the user can observe the beverage material and the delivery of the beverage material to the grinder assembly <b>500</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0127" num="0126">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b>C</figref>, one or more power cables <b>22</b><i>a</i>, <b>22</b><i>b</i> can connect to the rear side of the beverage apparatus <b>2</b> to deliver electricity to the apparatus <b>2</b>. The rear side of the beverage apparatus <b>2</b> can also include a number of vents <b>24</b>, <b>26</b> for cooling the beverage apparatus <b>2</b>. The vents <b>24</b>, <b>26</b> can also allow the beverage aroma to escape to help improve the customer experience. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b>D</figref>, a side of the beverage apparatus <b>2</b> can include one or more additional vents <b>32</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0128" num="0127">The rear side of the beverage apparatus <b>2</b> can also include a number of Ethernet or USB ports <b>28</b> to transfer information to and from the beverage apparatus <b>2</b> (see <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b>C</figref>), for example, to form a daisy chain. As another example, information related to the usage of the beverage apparatus <b>2</b> can be transferred to a central database for mining data. In yet another example, software updates can be transferred to the beverage apparatus <b>2</b>. The beverage apparatus <b>2</b> can also communicate with other beverage apparatuses <b>2</b>, for example, to coordinate power usage. Further, the beverage apparatus <b>2</b> can include a circuit breaker <b>30</b> disposed on the rear side of the apparatus <b>2</b>. Additional information related to data communication can be found in the U.S. Provisional Application No. 61/906,872, titled &#x201c;COOKING SYSTEM POWER MANAGEMENT,&#x201d; filed Nov. 20, 2014, and United States Application No. 14/548,226, titled &#x201c;COOKING SYSTEM POWER MANAGEMENT,&#x201d; which is filed on the same day as the present application and is Attorney Reference No. SBUX1.344A, both of which are hereby incorporated by reference in their entirety.</p>
<p id="p-0129" num="0128">Referring back to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b>A</figref>, the beverage apparatus <b>2</b> can include a base portion <b>16</b> for receiving or supporting a container <b>20</b>. The base portion <b>16</b> can include a drip plate <b>18</b> to capture any spilled beverage. In some embodiments, the base portion <b>16</b> can be in the fluid communication with a drain.</p>
<p id="p-0130" num="0129">As described above, the beverage apparatus <b>2</b> allows a user to quickly and easily brew a variety of types of single-cup portions of a beverage. To select the type and size of beverage, the beverage apparatus can include a number of controls <b>60</b>, <b>80</b>. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b>A</figref>, all of the controls <b>60</b>, <b>80</b> can be on a proximal side of the beverage machine <b>2</b> so that the features are hidden from customers.</p>
<p id="p-0131" num="0130">In some embodiments, the beverage apparatus can include a hopper selector assembly <b>80</b> having a number of paddles <b>82</b><i>a</i>, <b>82</b><i>b</i>, <b>82</b><i>c</i> that can be used to select one or more beverage materials (e.g., types of coffee beans). The beverage material selection can be automatically or manually cancelable. Further, the paddles <b>82</b><i>a</i>, <b>82</b><i>b</i>, <b>82</b><i>c</i> can mechanically reset to indicate completion of a brew cycle. In some embodiments, each paddle <b>82</b><i>a</i>, <b>82</b><i>b</i>, <b>82</b><i>c</i> corresponds to a separate hopper. The paddles <b>82</b><i>a</i>, <b>82</b><i>b</i>, <b>82</b><i>c</i> can be aligned with the hoppers. Alignment of the paddles <b>82</b><i>a</i>, <b>82</b><i>b</i>, <b>82</b><i>c</i> with the hoppers can provide visual confirmation of the correspondence between each paddle <b>82</b><i>a</i>, <b>82</b><i>b</i>, <b>82</b><i>c</i> and a selected hopper.</p>
<p id="p-0132" num="0131">In some embodiments, the beverage apparatus <b>2</b> can include a beverage size control assembly <b>60</b> that can be used to select the desired size of the beverage. The beverage size control assembly <b>60</b> can include a locking mechanism to prevent the size control assembly <b>60</b> from turning when pushed in. This locking mechanism ensures that the size control assembly <b>60</b> correctly indicates the size of the beverage being brewed.</p>
<p id="p-0133" num="0132">In some embodiments, the beverage apparatus <b>2</b> can include a display screen <b>10</b> that can display data or information relating to the beverage apparatus <b>2</b>, such as beverage parameters, settings, or maintenance reminders. The beverage apparatus <b>2</b> can also include a display control <b>12</b> to control the type of information being displayed or input specific parameters or settings.</p>
<p id="p-0134" num="0133">To accommodate different types of beverages, the beverage apparatus <b>2</b> can include three hopper assemblies <b>300</b>, each of which can hold a different type of beverage material (e.g., dark roast coffee, medium roast coffee, light roast coffee, and/or decaffeinated coffee). In other systems, the system may include more or less than three hopper assemblies <b>300</b>. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b>A</figref>, the hopper assemblies <b>300</b> are in a side-by-side configuration. The side-by-side configuration makes it easier to refill and maintain the hopper assemblies <b>300</b>. Further, the hopper assemblies <b>300</b> can be positioned such that a transverse axis of each hopper assembly <b>300</b> is substantially parallel with a base of the beverage apparatus <b>2</b>. The hopper assemblies <b>300</b> can deliver a controlled dose of beverage material without requiring an incline. However, in other embodiments, the hopper assemblies <b>300</b> can be positioned at an incline.</p>
<p id="p-0135" num="0134">The hopper assemblies <b>300</b> can be positioned above the upper portion <b>4</b> of the beverage apparatus <b>2</b>. For example, the beverage apparatus <b>2</b> can include a hopper retainer <b>8</b> for retaining the hopper assemblies <b>300</b>. Further, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b>C</figref>, each of the hopper assemblies <b>300</b> can include one or more hopper engagement features <b>360</b> disposed along a distal portion of the hopper assembly <b>300</b>. Each hopper engagement feature <b>360</b> can engage an adjacent hopper assembly <b>300</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0136" num="0135">As described in further detail below and shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>3</b>A-<b>3</b>J</figref>, each hopper assembly <b>300</b> can include a tapered auger <b>308</b> that can improve dose accuracy and increase the effective volume of the hopper. The hopper assemblies <b>300</b> can also retain the auger <b>308</b> in a manner for easy disassembly and easy cleaning. Further, each hopper assembly <b>300</b> can be directly or indirectly connected to a hopper motor <b>34</b> (see <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b>N</figref>). The hopper motor <b>34</b> can turn the auger <b>308</b> in a clockwise or counter-clockwise direction. As described in further detail below, the ability to reverse the auger 308 rotation can help reduce spillage and improve dose accuracy by providing a repeatable and known initial position.</p>
<p id="p-0137" num="0136">The beverage apparatus <b>2</b> may include at least one grinder assembly <b>500</b> for providing a controlled grind size (see <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>2</b>N and <b>5</b>A-<b>5</b>E</figref>). Each of the hopper assemblies <b>300</b> or a subset of the hopper assemblies <b>300</b> may be in communication with a single grinder assembly <b>500</b>. Use of a single grinder assembly <b>500</b> can reduce the cost of goods, reduce points of failure, and reduce the size of the beverage apparatus <b>2</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0138" num="0137">As described in further detail below, the grinder assembly <b>500</b> can include a grinder adjustment mechanism to automatically adjust the grind size based on the selected beverage. Further, the grinder assembly <b>500</b> can also include various safety features to undo jams or prevent operation when the grinder assembly <b>500</b> is not correctly positioned in the beverage apparatus <b>2</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0139" num="0138">In some embodiments, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>7</b>A</figref>, the beverage apparatus <b>2</b> can include a grinder outlet subassembly that can create positive pressure to displace steam and moisture from the grinder assembly <b>500</b>. The grinder outlet subassembly can include a baffle <b>712</b> positioned above the grinder assembly outlet <b>510</b> and a fan <b>702</b> that can provide airflow about the baffle device <b>712</b>. The baffle device <b>712</b> is positioned such that the grinder assembly outlet <b>510</b> is disposed between the fan <b>702</b>/baffle device <b>712</b> and the brew chamber <b>402</b>. In some embodiments, the baffle <b>712</b> can be disposed on an upper portion of a grinder cap <b>700</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0140" num="0139">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>6</b>A-<b>6</b>F</figref>, the beverage apparatus <b>2</b> can include an upper brewing assembly <b>600</b> with one or more fluid channels for delivering water to the brew chamber <b>402</b>. For example, a first fluid channel <b>604</b> can include a mixing valve <b>800</b> disposed at the outlet. As described in further detail below, the mixing valve <b>800</b> can produce a number of angled water jets. The angled water jets can immediately wet the ground material as the ground material enters the brew chamber <b>402</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0141" num="0140">Ground coffee can have a lot of static causing the coffee grinds to adhere to different components. If the ground coffee enters the grinder assembly <b>500</b>, the grinder assembly <b>500</b> can clog and shut down. Thus, immediately wetting the ground material can mitigate the amount of dry grounds that can adhere throughout the brew chamber <b>402</b>. Further, immediate wetting ensures that the ground material forms an evenly packed bed of grounds with a substantially uniform depth.</p>
<p id="p-0142" num="0141">The mixing valve <b>800</b> can also consistently and efficiently wet the ground material to advantageously maximize flavor extraction, and provide agitation. In doing so, the level of extraction from the beverage material can be consistent from cup to cup. Further, the mixing valve can maximize the level of extraction, which can lower the total amount of beverage material necessary.</p>
<p id="p-0143" num="0142">In some embodiments, the upper brewing assembly <b>600</b> can also include a second fluid channel <b>602</b> having a fill nozzle <b>806</b> through which water is delivered to the brew chamber. The temperature (e.g., net or at any time) of the water delivered from the fill nozzle <b>806</b> and the mixing valve <b>800</b> can be different. The difference in temperature can be actively controlled (e.g., using a heater) or passively controlled based on the geometry of the fill nozzle <b>806</b> and the mixing valve <b>800</b> (e.g., outlet diameter or surface area). Advantageously, the timing and amount of water delivered from the fill nozzle <b>806</b> and the mixing valve <b>800</b> can be controlled to produce different beverages.</p>
<p id="p-0144" num="0143">In certain aspects, the temperature difference can be actively controlled, for example, using a second heater and/or a separate water reservoir. In other aspects, the temperature difference is attributable to the difference between the diameter of the fill nozzle outlet and the diameter of the mixing valve outlet.</p>
<p id="p-0145" num="0144">In some embodiments, the upper brew assembly <b>600</b> is removable from the beverage apparatus <b>2</b> by opening the upper portion <b>4</b>. The upper brew assembly <b>600</b> can be easily disconnected for cleaning.</p>
<p id="p-0146" num="0145">In some embodiments, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>4</b>C-<b>4</b>E</figref>, a piston <b>426</b> can move through the brew chamber <b>402</b>. The brewing assembly <b>400</b> can include a relatively fine filter so that the dispensed beverage has an appropriate texture (e.g., clarity and/or level of particulates) and is not too murky. The filter can compensate for finer grinds and produce a cup of beverage with appropriate clarity. A relatively large piston <b>426</b> can also be advantageous because a large piston <b>426</b> allows the machine to provide a more aggressive and faster filtering process. The large piston <b>426</b> also allows the puck of ground material to be relatively thin to provide more efficient filtration. In some embodiments, the piston <b>426</b> has a diameter between about 3.0 inches and about 7.0 inches, such as about 5 inches, about 5.5 inches, or about 6.0 inches.</p>
<p id="p-0147" num="0146">In some embodiments, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>10</b>A-<b>10</b>F</figref>, the beverage apparatus <b>2</b> can include a rotary valve assembly <b>460</b> that includes a brew outlet valve <b>462</b>. The brew outlet valve <b>462</b> can transition between two or more valve positions. For example, the brew outlet valve <b>462</b> can transition between a first position wherein fluid communication is provided between the interior of the brew chamber <b>402</b> and the dispenser assembly <b>110</b>, and a second position wherein fluid communication is provided between the interior of the brew chamber <b>402</b> and a drain of the beverage apparatus <b>2</b>. The drain can comprise a fluid line (e.g. a flexible fluid line) between the rotary valve assembly <b>460</b> and a disposal system external to the brewing apparatus <b>2</b>. In some embodiments, the brew outlet valve <b>462</b> can transition to a third, closed position.</p>
<p id="p-0148" num="0147">In some embodiments, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>2</b>L-<b>2</b>M</figref>, the beverage apparatus <b>2</b> can include a hot water dispenser <b>118</b> independent from the beverage dispenser <b>116</b>. The dispenser assembly <b>110</b> can include a hot water valve system <b>130</b> to deliver water at different temperatures to the hot water dispenser <b>118</b>. This feature can be beneficial for producing multiple beverage products with different recipes, such as tea, hot chocolate, or oatmeal.</p>
<p id="p-0149" num="0148">In some embodiments, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>9</b>A-<b>9</b>B</figref>, the beverage apparatus <b>2</b> can include a plow assembly <b>432</b> that can clean interior components of the brewing assembly <b>400</b>. The plow assembly <b>432</b> can be automatic such that a user does not need to manually clean components of a brewing machine between brewing cycles. The plow assembly <b>432</b> can move grounds and residue to the waste bin <b>422</b>. The beverage apparatus <b>2</b> can also include a wiper <b>446</b> that can fully wipe the plow head <b>434</b> between cycles. Further, the plow assembly <b>432</b> can be configured for easy removal for serviceability.</p>
<p id="p-0150" num="0149">The beverage apparatus <b>2</b> can include various features to help cool the system. For example, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b>B</figref>, the beverage apparatus <b>2</b> can include a water intake assembly <b>40</b> that can dissipate heat within the apparatus <b>2</b>. The water intake <b>40</b> assembly can direct cool water through the heat sink <b>46</b> before entering the boiler <b>50</b>. As another example, the apparatus <b>2</b> can include an insulator ring <b>418</b> disposed between the brew chamber <b>402</b> and the upper brewing assembly <b>600</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0151" num="0150">Many of the features described herein, including, but not limited to, grind size adjustment, the brewing assembly, the water input system, the beverage dispensing features, and the plow assembly, are designed to brew beverages quickly. Existing brew processes for single-cup portions of a beverage often take more than 60 seconds. In contrast, the beverage apparatus <b>2</b> described herein can grind, brew, and dispense a single-cup portion of a beverage in about 60 seconds or less, such as less than 40 seconds, less than about 35 seconds, or less than about 30 seconds. In some embodiments, the beverage apparatus <b>2</b> can dispense the single-cup portion in less than about 10 seconds or less than about 5 seconds. Further, in some embodiments, the reset process, including cleaning the brewing assembly can also take about 30 seconds or less.</p>
<p id="p-0152" num="0151">Although the beverage apparatus <b>2</b> is described with certain features, one or more of the assemblies or components described above may be omitted, replaced, consolidated, or divided among multiple subassemblies. Additional features described below can also be included.</p>
<p id="p-0153" num="0152"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b>H</figref> is a block diagram of a beverage apparatus <b>1000</b> for brewing a beverage. Although the beverage apparatus <b>1000</b> may brew beverages (e.g., tea, cocoa) other than coffee, for purposes of explanation the structure and operation of the beverage apparatus <b>1000</b> are described in conjunction with the machine brewing coffee.</p>
<p id="p-0154" num="0153">The beverage apparatus <b>1000</b> can include a water intake assembly <b>1002</b>. In some embodiments, the water intake assembly <b>1002</b> can include a water filter to filter the water that is used to brew the beverage. However, the water filter may not be necessary if the beverage apparatus <b>2</b> is installed in an establishment that has a water-purification system separate from the machine. In some embodiments, the water intake assembly <b>1002</b> can include a heat sink through which water can flow. The heat sink can dissipate such conductive or radiant heat by transferring the heat to the water passing through the heat sink. Transfer of heat to the water can preheat the water before it enters the boiler. Preheating the water before it enters the boiler can reduce the power requirements for the boiler and/or other components within the beverage apparatus <b>2</b>. As described in further detail below, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b>B</figref> illustrates a possible water intake assembly <b>1002</b> configuration. In some embodiments, at least some water can flow directly to the boiler <b>1004</b> and bypass the water intake assembly <b>1002</b>, if present.</p>
<p id="p-0155" num="0154">The boiler <b>1004</b> can receive and store water from the water intake assembly <b>1002</b> and heat the stored water to a desired temperature, for example to a temperature in the range from 150&#xb0; F. to just below the boiling point of water, such as between about 190&#xb0; F. and about 200&#xb0; F. The heating element may be electric or any other type of conventional heating element.</p>
<p id="p-0156" num="0155">In some embodiments, the beverage apparatus <b>1000</b> can include one or more sensors to measure the water temperature in the boiler <b>1004</b> or flowing from the boiler <b>1004</b>. For example, the beverage apparatus <b>1000</b> can include a water temperature control assembly <b>1006</b> that can alter the temperature of the water from the boiler <b>1004</b> to provide different brew temperatures from cup to cup. The water temperature control assembly <b>1006</b> can receive water from the boiler <b>1004</b> during a brewing cycle, and, in response to the controller <b>1026</b>, can adjust the temperature of the water received from the boiler <b>1004</b>. In one implementation, the water temperature control assembly <b>1006</b> can mix the heated water from the boiler <b>1004</b> with colder water from the water intake assembly <b>1002</b> or water inlet to lower the temperature of the water used to brew the beverage. The water temperature control assembly <b>1006</b> may operate in an open-loop configuration by relying on a thermodynamic algorithm that, using the sensed temperatures of the heated and cold water, regulates the amount of cold water mixed with the heated water to provide water having a desired temperature. Alternatively, the water temperature control assembly <b>1006</b> may operate in a closed-loop configuration by sensing the temperature of the provided water and, in response to the sensed temperature, regulating the amount of cold water mixed with the heated water to provide water having the desired temperature. Moreover, instead of mixing water from the water intake assembly <b>1002</b> with the heated water, the water temperature control assembly <b>1006</b> may include a heat exchanger that allows the cold water to cool the heated water without actually mixing with the heated water. The water temperature control assembly <b>1006</b> may also be able to heat the water used to brew the beverage above the temperature of the water in the boiler <b>1004</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0157" num="0156">In some embodiments, the water temperature control assembly <b>1006</b> can sense the temperature of a fluid in the brew chamber. Based on the sensed temperature, the water temperature control assembly <b>1006</b> can control the temperature of water flowing into the brew chamber. For example, if the temperature of the fluid in the brew chamber is too high, cool water can be directed to the brewing assembly <b>1010</b>. If the temperature of the fluid in the brew chamber is too low, hot water can be directed to the brewing assembly <b>1010</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0158" num="0157">Alternatively, the beverage apparatus <b>1000</b> may not include a water temperature control assembly <b>1006</b> and depend on the boiler <b>1004</b> to heat the water to the desired temperature.</p>
<p id="p-0159" num="0158">The water measuring and transporting assembly <b>1008</b> transports a predetermined amount of water from the temperature control assembly <b>1006</b> to the brewing assembly <b>1010</b> during a brewing cycle. The brewing assembly <b>1010</b> can receive heated water from the water measuring and transporting assembly <b>1008</b>, receive ground material from the grinder assembly <b>1024</b>, brew a beverage, and then provide the brewed beverage to the dispensing assembly <b>1014</b> via the fluid transporting assembly <b>1012</b>. As described in further detail below, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>4</b>A-<b>4</b>F</figref> illustrate a possible embodiment of the brewing assembly. In some embodiments, the brewing assembly <b>1010</b> can include an upper brewing assembly (such as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>6</b>A-<b>6</b>F</figref>) to deliver water to the brew chamber. In some embodiments, the beverage apparatus <b>1000</b> can include a grinder outlet subassembly (as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>7</b>A</figref>) to prevent water from moving from the brewing assembly <b>1010</b> to the grinder assembly <b>1024</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0160" num="0159">In some embodiments, the water measuring and transporting assembly <b>1008</b> does not include a pump and relies on gravity and/or external fluid line pressure to move fluid to the brewing chamber <b>1010</b>. The controller <b>1026</b> can determine the amount of water provided to the brewing assembly <b>1010</b> based on a number of flow meters in the beverage apparatus <b>1000</b>. For example, a flow meter <b>46</b> can be included in the water intake assembly <b>40</b>. The flow meter <b>46</b> can measure the volume of water entering the beverage apparatus <b>2</b> via the water intake assembly <b>40</b>. In some embodiments, a second flow meter (not shown) is positioned in a fluid line to a hot water dispenser. The second flow meter can measure the water output to the hot water dispenser. For example, the second flow meter can detect when hot water is output from the boiler <b>50</b> via the hot water dispenser (e.g., for brewing tea, for filling a French press, or otherwise).</p>
<p id="p-0161" num="0160">In other embodiments, the water measuring and transporting assembly <b>1008</b> can include a pump for directing water to the brewing assembly <b>1010</b>. The controller <b>1026</b> can determine the amount of water that the provided to the brewing assembly <b>1010</b> based on the pump rate and the amount of time that the pump is active.</p>
<p id="p-0162" num="0161">In some embodiments, the water measuring and transporting assembly <b>1008</b> can also transport a predetermined amount of water to the brewing assembly <b>1010</b> during a cleaning cycle. The brewing assembly <b>1010</b> can also include a cleaning system, such as a plow assembly <b>432</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>9</b>A and <b>9</b>B</figref>), to move spent ground material and residue from the brewing assembly <b>1010</b> to the solid waste disposal <b>1020</b>. The solid waste disposal <b>1020</b> may include a receptacle that one periodically removes for emptying, or that is connected to an electronic garbage disposer or directly to the sewer line of the establishment in which the beverage apparatus <b>2</b> is installed. In addition, the solid waste disposal <b>1020</b> may be connected to receive tap water, and may use the tap water to flush &#x201c;ground-through&#x201d; and spent coffee from the disposal unit into the garbage disposer unit or directly into the sewer line. The solid waste disposal <b>1020</b> may periodically commence an automatic flushing sequence, e.g., after brewing each cup of coffee, or may commence the flushing sequence manually. In some embodiments, the solid waste disposal <b>1020</b> is the same as the liquid waste disposal <b>1016</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0163" num="0162">In some embodiments, the beverage apparatus <b>1000</b> can include a fluid transporting assembly <b>1012</b> to direct the beverage to the dispensing assembly <b>1014</b> and/or liquid waste to the liquid waste disposal <b>1016</b> (e.g., waste bin or drain). The fluid transporting assembly <b>1012</b> can include a valve or valve assembly that can transition between a first valve position wherein fluid communication is provided between the interior of the brewing assembly <b>1010</b> and the dispenser assembly <b>1014</b>, and a second valve position wherein fluid communication is provided between the brewing assembly <b>1010</b> and the liquid waste disposal <b>1016</b>. The fluid transporting assembly <b>1012</b> may respond to the controller <b>1026</b> to move between the first and second valve positions. For example, the fluid transporting assembly <b>1012</b> can include a rotary valve assembly <b>460</b> as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>10</b>A-<b>10</b>C</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0164" num="0163">The dispensing assembly <b>1014</b> can include one or more dispensers. For example, the dispensing assembly <b>1014</b> can include a beverage dispenser that can dispense a selected beverage. In some embodiments, the dispensing assembly <b>1014</b> can include a water dispenser. The water dispenser may include one or more fluid inlets connected to the boiler <b>1004</b> and/or a water source external to the apparatus <b>1000</b>. In some embodiments, the dispensing assembly <b>1014</b> can include one or more valve assemblies to control fluid inflow and outflow. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>2</b>L and <b>2</b>M</figref> illustrate possible embodiments of the dispensing assembly <b>1014</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0165" num="0164">In some embodiments, beverage apparatus <b>1000</b> can include one or more sensors to detect and monitor qualities of the finished beverage. Data obtained from the one or more sensors may be stored and logged in the memory <b>1038</b>. The one or more sensors may include sensors that can detect qualities such as temperature, opacity, total dissolved solids (or TDS), and Brix (e.g., sugar content of the beverage). The one or more sensors can conduct a final quality control check for the brewed beverage and indicate to the controller <b>1026</b> if certain data falls outside of predetermined tolerance ranges. For example, if the beverage temperature is low at the dispensing assembly <b>1014</b>, then a user may discover that a heating element of the apparatus <b>1000</b> has failed. In some embodiments, the one or more sensors are disposed at or near the dispensing assembly <b>1000</b>. In some embodiments, the one or more sensors may conduct initial and/or intermediate quality control checks in addition to, or in place of, a final quality control check.</p>
<p id="p-0166" num="0165">The base assembly <b>1018</b> can hold or receive a container while the dispenser assembly <b>1014</b> fills the container with the brewed beverage (or water as described below). In some embodiments, the base assembly <b>1018</b> can include a drain portion to absorb, e.g., spillage from the cup and drippings from the dispenser assembly <b>1014</b>. The drain portion may be removable for emptying, connected to the liquid waste disposal <b>1016</b>, or connected directly to the sewer line of the establishment in which the beverage apparatus <b>2</b> is installed. In some embodiments, the base assembly <b>1018</b> can include a container-sensing unit (not shown) to indicate to the controller <b>1026</b> whether a container is present in the base assembly <b>1018</b>. If the container is not present after the brewing assembly <b>1010</b> has brewed the beverage, then the controller <b>1026</b> may deactivate or close the fluid transporting assembly <b>1012</b> to prevent the dispense of the brewed beverage. As another example, if the container is present during a cleaning cycle, then the controller <b>1026</b> may deactivate or close the fluid transporting assembly <b>1012</b> to prevent rinse water from dispensing into the container. The cup-sensing unit may include any type of sensor, such as an optical, mechanical, or ultrasonic sensor.</p>
<p id="p-0167" num="0166">In some embodiments, the base portion <b>16</b> can include one or more sensors to detect and monitor qualities regarding the size and volume of a container for the brewed beverage. The one or more sensors can detect the size of the container <b>20</b> and provide information to the controller <b>1026</b> to ensure that the appropriate quantity of beverage is dispensed. An interlock feature can activate to dispense only an appropriate amount of brewed beverage based on the size of the container present. For example, the one or more sensors can ensure that the beverage apparatus <b>1000</b> does not dispense <b>20</b> ounces of beverage when an 8-ounce container is present. In some embodiments, the interlock feature may comprise a motion interlock feature and/or an ultrasonic interlock feature.</p>
<p id="p-0168" num="0167">The beverage apparatus <b>1000</b> may include one or more hopper assemblies <b>1022</b> for holding beverage material, which are fed to the grinding assembly <b>1024</b>. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>3</b>A-<b>3</b>J</figref> illustrate one such hopper assembly, which can include an auger system to deliver the beverage material to the grinder assembly <b>1024</b>. The controller <b>1026</b> may indicate the amount of beverage material to be delivered to the grinder assembly <b>1024</b>. Where the beverage apparatus <b>2</b> includes multiple hopper assemblies <b>1022</b>, then one can load different types of beverage material into each hopper assembly <b>1022</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0169" num="0168">In response to the controller <b>1026</b>, the grinder assembly <b>1024</b> can grind beverage material from the hopper assembly <b>1022</b>, and then provide to the brewing assembly <b>1010</b> a predetermined amount of ground material. The controller <b>1026</b> may indicate one of multiple grind sizes (e.g., coarse, normal, fine) to the grinder assembly <b>1024</b>, as the grind size may affect the taste and other characteristics of the brewed coffee. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>5</b>A-<b>5</b>E</figref> illustrate one possible embodiment for the grinder assembly <b>500</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0170" num="0169">In some embodiments, the grinder assembly <b>1024</b> can include a safety mechanism for when a foreign object is caught in the grinder assembly <b>1024</b>.

For example, steam from hot water and brewing the beverage may condense and damage or otherwise render inoperable the controller <b>1028</b>. Furthermore, condensation on the conduits that carry cold tap water may cause similar problems. Therefore, a moisture barrier <b>1028</b> helps keep the controller <b>1026</b> and associated circuitry dry.</p>
<p id="p-0172" num="0171">The controller <b>1026</b> controls the operation of some or all of the other components of the beverage apparatus <b>1000</b> as discussed above, and includes a processor <b>1032</b>, a memory <b>1038</b>, a control panel and display <b>1030</b>, and a communications port <b>1036</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0173" num="0172">The processor <b>1032</b> executes a software program stored in the memory <b>1038</b> or in another memory (not shown), and controls the operations of the components of the beverage apparatus <b>1000</b> as described above and as described below.</p>
<p id="p-0174" num="0173">In addition to storing one or more software programs, the memory <b>1038</b> may store sets of predetermined brew parameters or recipes as discussed in further detail below. The memory <b>1038</b> can also store data associated with machine activity (e.g., number of brewed beverages, types of brewed beverages or sizes of brewed beverages).</p>
<p id="p-0175" num="0174">The control panel and display <b>1030</b> allows an operator to enter brewing options (e.g., coffee type, cup size, and brewing parameters) or to select brewing options from a menu that the processor <b>1032</b> may generate on the display. For example, the operator may select via the control panel and display <b>1030</b> individual brewing parameters (e.g., grind size, water temperature, brewing time, and the coffee-ground-to-water ratio), or a set of predetermined brewing parameters stored in the memory <b>1038</b>. As an example of the latter, a coffee roaster may have determined preferred brewing parameters for its coffee. One may then store these preferred parameters in the memory <b>1038</b> as a set, and associate the set with an identifier, such as the name or type of the coffee. Therefore, instead of entering or selecting each brewing parameter individually, which may be tedious, the operator merely enters or selects from a menu the identifier, and the controller <b>1026</b> causes the beverage apparatus <b>1000</b> to brew coffee according to the set of parameters corresponding to the identifier.</p>
<p id="p-0176" num="0175">In some embodiments, instead of or in addition to the control panel and display, the beverage apparatus <b>1000</b> can include a number of other input controls <b>1034</b> for selecting brewing options. For example, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>2</b>C-<b>2</b>K</figref>, the beverage apparatus <b>1000</b> can include a hopper selector assembly <b>80</b> and/or a beverage size control assembly <b>60</b>.</p>

For example, the port <b>1038</b> may be connected to a computer (not shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b>H</figref>) so that one can program or run diagnostics from the computer. The port <b>1038</b> may also be connected to another beverage apparatus <b>1000</b> to communicate information (e.g., brewing parameters or power supply information). As another example, the port <b>1036</b> may be connected to the internet, so that one can download into the memory <b>1038</b> data such as sets of brewing parameters or upload usage statistics from the beverage apparatus <b>1000</b>. In addition, the port <b>1036</b> may receive data via a wireless channel, such as a set of brewing parameters from a RFID tag or a barcode on a container of coffee or on a coffee cup (the tag may hold the cup owner&#x2019;s preferred coffee type, cup size, or brew parameters). Furthermore, the port <b>1036</b> may allow the processor <b>1032</b> to download demographic information, such as coffee-drinker preferences and number of cups brewed, to a coffee roaster or supplier or to the manufacturer/supplier of the beverage apparatus <b>1000</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0178" num="0177">Alternate embodiments of the beverage apparatus <b>1000</b> are contemplated.

<heading level="1" id="h-0008">Water Intake Assembly</heading>
<p id="p-0179" num="0178">As described above, water can flow from the water inlet to the water intake assembly <b>40</b>. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b>B</figref> illustrates a water intake assembly <b>40</b> for the apparatus <b>2</b>. The water intake assembly <b>40</b> can include a water inlet <b>42</b>. The water inlet <b>42</b> can be positioned on the bottom of the apparatus <b>2</b>. In some embodiments, the water inlet <b>42</b> is positioned on a side (e.g., the front, back, left, or right side) of the apparatus <b>2</b>, or some other surface of the apparatus <b>2</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0180" num="0179">The water intake assembly <b>40</b> can include an inlet manifold <b>44</b>. The inlet manifold <b>44</b> can comprise one or more internal fluid channels <b>43</b>, <b>45</b>. For example, the water inlet <b>42</b> can lead into an inlet channel <b>43</b> of the inlet manifold <b>44</b>. Water in the inlet channel of the inlet manifold <b>44</b> can be directed to a first outlet of the inlet manifold <b>44</b>. The first outlet of the inlet manifold <b>44</b> can communicate with an internal passage <b>41</b> of a flow meter <b>46</b>. The flow meter <b>46</b> can be attached to the inlet manifold <b>44</b>. For example, mechanical fasteners or other attachment methods (e.g., adhesion, welding) can be used to attach the flow meter <b>46</b> to the inlet manifold <b>44</b>. The flow meter <b>46</b> can measure the volume of water flowing into the boiler <b>50</b> of the apparatus <b>2</b> from the water inlet <b>42</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0181" num="0180">Water can be passed through the internal passage <b>41</b> of the flow meter <b>46</b> and back into the inlet manifold <b>44</b> via a secondary inlet (not shown) of the inlet manifold <b>44</b>. Water can exit the inlet manifold <b>44</b> to the boiler <b>50</b> via a manifold outlet <b>48</b>. The manifold outlet <b>48</b> can be positioned on the top of the inlet manifold <b>44</b>, or on some other surface of the inlet manifold <b>44</b>. As illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b>BB</figref>, the manifold outlet <b>48</b> can be in fluid communication with an outlet channel <b>45</b> of the intake manifold <b>44</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0182" num="0181">The water intake assembly <b>40</b> can include one or more sensors. For example, a temperature probe <b>49</b> may be positioned on the inlet manifold <b>44</b>. The temperature probe <b>49</b> can measure a temperature of the water passing through one or more of the internal fluid channel of the inlet manifold <b>44</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0183" num="0182">In some embodiments, a solid state relay <b>47</b> is connected (e.g., via adhesives, welding, and/or mechanical fasteners) to the inlet manifold. The inlet manifold <b>44</b> can dissipate heat within the apparatus <b>2</b>. For example, the inlet manifold <b>44</b> can absorb radiant heat from within the apparatus <b>2</b> and/or conductive heat from one or more components of the apparatus <b>2</b> (e.g., the solid state relay <b>47</b>, the boiler, the auger, the brewing assembly, the grinder, or other components of the apparatus <b>2</b>). The inlet manifold <b>44</b> can dissipate such conductive or radiant heat by transferring the heat to the water passing through the inlet manifold <b>44</b>. In some embodiments, the water received by the inlet manifold <b>44</b> via the water inlet <b>42</b> is cold water (e.g., filtered and/or refrigerated water). The water that passes through the water intake assembly <b>40</b> can be directed to the boiler <b>50</b> via a fluid conduit (e.g., a hose or pipe). Dissipation of heat from the solid state relay <b>47</b> and/or from other system components can preheat the water entering the boiler. Preheating the water entering the boiler can reduce system power requirements.</p>
<p id="p-0184" num="0183">The boiler <b>50</b> can operate as a saturated boiler. For example, the boiler <b>50</b> can remain substantially full of liquid before, during, and after a brew cycle or hot water dispense. In some embodiments, as hot water is pulled from the boiler <b>50</b> to the mixing nozzle and/or to the hot water dispenser, cold water is pulled into the boiler <b>50</b> via the water intake assembly <b>40</b>. The boiler <b>50</b> can include an internal heater (e.g., a resistive heater) that heats cool water entering the boiler <b>50</b>.</p>

<p id="p-0185" num="0184">As illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>2</b>C-<b>2</b>H</figref>, the apparatus <b>2</b> can include a beverage size control assembly <b>60</b>. The beverage size control assembly <b>60</b> can include a size control member <b>62</b>. The size control member <b>62</b> can be, for example, a knob, a button, a dial, or some other user input. The control member <b>62</b> can include one or more visual indicators <b>64</b>. For example, the control member <b>62</b> can include a notch or other marking on an exterior surface of the control member <b>62</b>. Alignment of the visual indicator <b>64</b> with or without a visual indicator on a surface of the apparatus <b>2</b> can provide a visual confirmation of a setting of the control member <b>62</b> and of the size control assembly <b>60</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0186" num="0185">In some embodiments, the size control member <b>62</b> can be moved along its axis of rotation. For example, a user could push the control member toward the apparatus <b>2</b>. In some embodiments, the size control assembly <b>60</b> includes one or more rotational locking features. For example, the assembly <b>60</b> can include a rotation limiter <b>62</b><i>a</i>. The rotation limiter <b>62</b><i>a</i> can be, for example, a protrusion can fit within a limiter channel in the size control member <b>62</b>. The limiter channel can extend along a portion of the circumference of the size control member <b>62</b>. Interference between the limiter <b>62</b><i>a</i> and the ends of the limiter channel can limit the extent to which the size control member <b>62</b> is permitted to rotate.</p>
<p id="p-0187" num="0186">In some embodiments, the control member <b>62</b> includes one or more indentations into a surface of the control member <b>62</b>. The control assembly <b>60</b> can include one or more stops. For example, the control assembly <b>60</b> can include an anti-rotation pin <b>66</b> (see <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b>D</figref>). The anti- rotation pin <b>66</b> can couple with a slot <b>66</b><i>a</i> or other indentation in the control member to inhibit rotational movement of the control member <b>62</b> when the control member is pushed in. Limiting the rotational movement of the control member <b>62</b> when it is pushed in can inhibit a user of the apparatus <b>2</b> from inadvertently changing the size setting during a brew cycle. In some embodiments, inhibiting or preventing the control member <b>62</b> from rotating during a brewing cycle can provide visual confirmation of the size of the beverage being brewed. Visual confirmation of the size of the beverage being brewed can help reduce the likelihood that an incorrect (e.g., wrong-sized) container (e.g., a mug or cup) is used for a given beverage cycle.</p>
<p id="p-0188" num="0187">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>2</b>E-<b>2</b>H</figref>, the control member <b>62</b> can be attached to a size control shaft <b>61</b>.

In some embodiments, the control member <b>62</b> and size control shaft <b>61</b> are formed (e.g., molded, extruded) as a monolithic part. The size control shaft <b>61</b> can be rotationally locked to the control member <b>62</b>. For example, rotation of the control member <b>62</b> can cause the shaft <b>61</b> to rotate at a substantially equivalent rate and to a substantially equivalent angular extent.</p>
<p id="p-0189" num="0188">The shaft <b>61</b> can be inserted through size encoder assembly <b>63</b>. In some embodiments, the shaft <b>61</b>, or some portion thereof, is keyed to correspond with an aperture shape in the encoder assembly <b>63</b>. The shaft <b>61</b> can be rotational locked (e.g., via the keyed fit or otherwise) to the encoder assembly <b>63</b> such that rotation of the shaft <b>61</b> causes corresponding rotation of the encoder assembly <b>63</b>.

In some embodiments, one or more retention structures <b>73</b> (e.g., rings, collars, protrusions) are positioned on the shaft <b>61</b> (e.g., in a recess of the shaft <b>61</b>). The retention structure <b>73</b> can inhibit inadvertent movement of the shaft <b>61</b> in the proximal direction (e.g., toward the control member <b>62</b>) beyond a predetermined point. For example, the retention structure <b>73</b> can interfere with a portion of the apparatus <b>2</b> (e.g., a wall <b>74</b> through which the shaft <b>61</b> passes) when the control member <b>62</b> is pulled away from the apparatus <b>2</b> due to the biasing force of the biasing structure <b>69</b> or due to pulling on the control member <b>62</b> by a user. In some embodiments, the retention structure <b>73</b> of the size control assembly <b>60</b> is positioned distal of the wall <b>74</b>.

In the default position, the stop <b>66</b> is disengaged from the slot <b>66</b><i>a</i>. As such, a user may rotate the beverage size control member <b>62</b> about an axis of the size control shaft <b>61</b> to select a size for a beverage. The beverage size control member <b>62</b> can include a detent structure that can bias the beverage size control member <b>62</b> into discrete rotational positions. For example, the size control member <b>62</b> can include a hub portion having a finite number of slots or detentions sized and shaped to receive a ball or other detent member. The detent member can be housed in a radially-extending slot in a portion of the size control member <b>62</b> radially outward from the hub portion. In some embodiments, the detent member is biased toward the hub portion by a spring or other biasing structure. In some embodiments, the discrete rotational positions of the size control member <b>62</b>, the shaft <b>61</b>, and/or the encoder <b>63</b> correspond to discrete settings for the beverage size control assembly <b>60</b>.</p>

<p id="p-0197" num="0196">In some embodiments, the apparatus <b>2</b> can release the size control member <b>62</b> to the default position upon completion of a brewing cycle. For example, the apparatus <b>2</b> can signal the solenoid <b>67</b> to move the shaft retainer <b>65</b> to the disengaged position upon dispensing of the completed beverage from the apparatus <b>2</b>. Transition of the shaft retainer to the disengaged position can permit the biasing structure <b>69</b><i>a</i> to bias the size control member <b>62</b> to the default position. Transition of the size control member <b>62</b> to the default position upon completion of a brewing cycle can provide visual and/or audible confirmation of the completion of the brewing cycle.</p>
<heading level="1" id="h-0010">Hopper Selector Assembly</heading>
<p id="p-0198" num="0197">The apparatus <b>2</b> can include a hopper selector assembly <b>80</b>. In some embodiments, the hopper selector assembly <b>80</b> can include one or more user input structures <b>82</b>. For example, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>2</b>I and <b>2</b>J</figref>, the user input structure <b>82</b> can include one or more paddles <b>82</b><i>a</i>, <b>82</b><i>b</i>, <b>82</b><i>c</i>. As illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b>I</figref>, the hopper selector <b>80</b> includes a left paddle <b>82</b><i>a</i>, a center paddle <b>82</b><i>b</i> and a right paddle <b>82</b><i>c</i>. Each of the paddles <b>82</b><i>a</i>, <b>82</b><i>b</i>, <b>82</b><i>c</i> can be used to select one or more hopper assemblies <b>300</b>. The paddles <b>82</b><i>a</i>, <b>82</b><i>b</i>, <b>82</b><i>c</i> can rotate about a hinge point. In some embodiments, the paddles <b>82</b><i>a</i>, <b>82</b><i>b</i>, <b>82</b><i>c</i> are biased to a disengaged position (e.g., the position illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b>J</figref>). The paddles <b>82</b><i>a</i>, <b>82</b><i>b</i>, <b>82</b><i>c</i> may be biased by a spring (e.g., a torsion spring) or other biasing structure (not shown).</p>
<p id="p-0199" num="0198">In some embodiments, actuation (e.g., depression, switching, or turning) of first one of the paddles <b>82</b><i>a</i>, <b>82</b><i>b</i>, <b>82</b><i>c</i> selects one of the hopper assemblies <b>300</b> for the brewing cycle. In some embodiments, actuation of a second paddle <b>82</b><i>a</i>, <b>82</b><i>b</i>, <b>82</b><i>c</i> releases the first paddle and adjusts the hopper assembly selection to an alternative hopper assembly <b>300</b>. The hopper selector <b>80</b> can permit actuation of two or more paddles <b>82</b><i>a</i>, <b>82</b><i>b</i>, <b>82</b><i>c</i> to select two or more of the hopper assemblies <b>300</b> (e.g., to brew two or more types of beans together, such as caffeinated and decaffeinated coffees). For example, substantially simultaneous actuation of two or more of the paddles <b>82</b><i>a</i>, <b>82</b><i>b</i>, <b>82</b><i>c</i> can release beans from two or more of the hopper assemblies <b>300</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0200" num="0199">In some embodiments, operation of the hopper selector assembly <b>80</b> is at least partially controlled by software protocols. For example, after actuation of a first paddle <b>82</b><i>a</i>, <b>82</b><i>b</i>, <b>82</b><i>c</i>, the hopper selector assembly <b>80</b> can permit actuation of a second paddle <b>82</b><i>a</i>, <b>82</b><i>b</i>, <b>82</b><i>c</i> when one of the first and second paddles <b>82</b><i>a</i>, <b>82</b><i>b</i>, <b>82</b><i>c</i> correspond to caffeinated coffee and the other paddle corresponds to decaffeinated coffee. In some embodiments, actuation of a second paddle <b>82</b><i>a</i>, <b>82</b><i>b</i>, <b>82</b><i>c</i> that is of the same caffeine character (e.g., decaffeinated or caffeinated) as the first paddle <b>82</b><i>a</i>, <b>82</b><i>b</i>, <b>82</b><i>c</i> releases the first paddle <b>82</b><i>a</i>, <b>82</b><i>b</i>, <b>82</b><i>c</i> and configures the brewing apparatus <b>2</b> to release beans from the hopper corresponding to the second paddle <b>82</b><i>a</i>, <b>82</b><i>b</i>, <b>82</b><i>c</i>.</p>
<p id="p-0201" num="0200">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b>J</figref>, the user input structure <b>82</b> can include an actuating portion <b>84</b>. For example, each of the paddles <b>82</b><i>a</i>, <b>82</b><i>b</i>, <b>82</b><i>c</i> can include a hopper actuating portion <b>84</b><i>a</i>, <b>84</b><i>b</i>, <b>84</b><i>c</i>. The actuating portion <b>84</b> of the paddles can move about the hinge point when the input structure <b>82</b> is pushed down. For example, the hopper actuating portion <b>84</b><i>a</i> can be moved upward as the left paddle <b>82</b><i>a</i> is pushed downward to an engaged position. Each of the hopper actuating portions <b>84</b><i>a</i>, <b>84</b><i>b</i>, <b>84</b><i>c</i> can include a sensor-tripping portion (e.g., a protrusion) (not shown). The sensor tripping portion of each hopper actuating portion <b>84</b><i>a</i>, <b>84</b><i>b</i>, <b>84</b><i>c</i> can engage with a sensor <b>83</b><i>a</i>, <b>83</b><i>b</i>, <b>83</b><i>c</i> (e.g., an optical sensor, mechanical switch, proximity sensor). Engagement between the tripping portions and the sensors <b>83</b><i>a</i>, <b>83</b><i>b</i>, <b>83</b><i>c</i> can signal one or more of the hopper assemblies <b>300</b> to release beverage material to the grinder assembly <b>500</b>. For example, engagement between the tripping portion of the hopper actuating portion <b>84</b><i>a</i> and the sensor <b>83</b><i>a</i> can signal a first hopper assembly <b>300</b> to release beverage material and engagement between the tripping portion of the hopper actuating portion <b>84</b><i>b</i> and the sensor <b>83</b><i>b</i> can signal a second hopper assembly <b>300</b> to release beverage material. In some embodiments, a hopper assembly <b>300</b> is signaled to release beverage material upon actuation of both the beverage size control member <b>62</b> and one or more paddles <b>82</b><i>a</i>, <b>82</b><i>b</i>, <b>82</b><i>c</i>.</p>
<p id="p-0202" num="0201">An input retaining structure (e.g., paddle retainer <b>85</b>) can be positioned on a rear side of the hopper selector assembly <b>80</b>. The paddle retainer <b>85</b> can retain one or more of the hopper actuating portions <b>84</b><i>a</i>, <b>84</b><i>b</i>, <b>84</b><i>c</i> in a raised position (e.g., retaining one or more of the paddles <b>82</b><i>a</i>, <b>82</b><i>b</i>, <b>82</b><i>c</i> in a depressed position). For example, the hopper actuating portions <b>84</b><i>a</i>, <b>84</b><i>b</i>, <b>84</b><i>c</i> can include magnets that can couple (e.g., magnetically) with the paddle retainer <b>86</b> when the corresponding paddle <b>82</b><i>a</i>, <b>82</b><i>b</i>, <b>82</b><i>c</i> is depressed. The paddle retainer <b>85</b> can retain the hopper actuating portion <b>84</b><i>a</i>, <b>84</b><i>b</i>, <b>84</b><i>c</i> of one or more of the paddles <b>82</b><i>a</i>, <b>82</b><i>b</i>, <b>82</b><i>c</i> during the duration of a brewing cycle and dispense of a beverage.</p>
<p id="p-0203" num="0202">In some embodiments, the hopper selector assembly <b>80</b> can include a paddle disengagement structure <b>86</b>. The disengagement structure <b>86</b> can be, for example, a bar that can move the hopper actuating portions <b>84</b><i>a</i>, <b>84</b><i>b</i>, <b>84</b><i>c</i> (e.g., the magnetic portions thereof) away from the paddle retainer <b>85</b>. The disengagement structure <b>86</b> can be moved by a solenoid <b>88</b> or other control structure. The biasing force provided by the biasing structure (not shown) of the one or more engaged paddles <b>82</b><i>a</i>, <b>82</b><i>b</i>, <b>82</b><i>c</i> can decouple the one or more hopper actuating portions <b>84</b><i>a</i>, <b>84</b><i>b</i>, <b>84</b><i>c</i> and the paddle retainer <b>85</b> to return the one or more engaged paddles <b>82</b><i>a</i>, <b>82</b><i>b</i>, <b>82</b><i>c</i> to the disengaged position.</p>
<p id="p-0204" num="0203">Depression of one or more of the paddles <b>82</b><i>a</i>, <b>82</b><i>b</i>, <b>82</b><i>c</i> can initiate a brew cycle for the apparatus <b>2</b>. In some embodiments, depression of one or more of the paddles <b>82</b><i>a</i>, <b>82</b><i>b</i>, <b>82</b><i>c</i> activates a dispense assembly (e.g., augers <b>308</b>) of one or more of the hopper assemblies <b>300</b>. The paddles <b>82</b><i>a</i>, <b>82</b><i>b</i>, <b>82</b><i>c</i> can end a brew cycle (e.g., before dispensing of a beverage) upon manual release (e.g., lifting) of one or more of the paddles <b>82</b><i>a</i>, <b>82</b><i>b</i>, <b>82</b><i>c</i>. The paddles <b>82</b><i>a</i>, <b>82</b><i>b</i>, <b>82</b><i>c</i> and/or augers <b>308</b> can be configured to provide visual confirmation to a user of the device and/or to a customer when a specific hopper is selected. For example, selection of one or more paddles can initiate agitation of the contents of the respective hoppers which may be viewable from outside of the apparatus <b>2</b>. In some embodiments, disengagement of one or more of the hopper actuating portions <b>84</b><i>a</i>, <b>84</b><i>b</i>, <b>84</b><i>c</i> from the paddle retainer <b>85</b> during a brew cycle will end the brew cycle.</p>
<p id="p-0205" num="0204">In some embodiments, the apparatus <b>2</b> can release the one or more actuating structures <b>84</b><i>a</i>, <b>84</b><i>b</i>, <b>84</b><i>c</i> from the raised (e.g., engaged) position at the end of a brew cycle. For example, the disengagement structure <b>86</b> can release the one or more hopper actuating portions <b>84</b><i>a</i>, <b>84</b><i>b</i>, <b>84</b><i>c</i> from the engaged position upon completion of a brewing cycle (e.g., upon dispense of the beverage). Release of the one or more hopper actuating portions <b>84</b><i>a</i>, <b>84</b><i>b</i>, <b>84</b><i>c</i> and corresponding transition of the paddles <b>82</b><i>a</i>, <b>82</b><i>b</i>, <b>82</b><i>c</i> from the engaged to the disengaged position can provide visual confirmation that the brewing cycle is completed.</p>

<p id="p-0208" num="0207">The hopper selector assembly <b>80</b>&#x2032; can include an input retaining structure (e.g., paddle retainer <b>85</b>&#x2032;) having a plurality of actuator tracks <b>85</b><i>a</i>, <b>85</b><i>b</i>, <b>85</b><i>c</i>. One or more of the actuator tracks <b>85</b><i>a</i>, <b>85</b><i>b</i>, <b>85</b><i>c</i> can include a pair of flexible extension (e.g., legs) defining a track through which a portion of each of the hopper actuating portions <b>84</b><i>a</i>, <b>84</b><i>b</i>, <b>84</b><i>c</i> may pass as the hopper actuating portions <b>84</b><i>a</i>, <b>84</b><i>b</i>, <b>84</b><i>c</i> transition between the engaged (e.g., raised) position and the disengaged (e.g., lowered) position.</p>
<p id="p-0209" num="0208">The actuator tracks <b>85</b><i>a</i>, <b>85</b><i>b</i>, <b>85</b><i>c</i> can include a narrowed portion forming a seat <b>81</b><i>a</i>, <b>81</b><i>b</i>, <b>81</b><i>c</i>. The flexible extensions of the tracks <b>85</b><i>a</i>, <b>85</b><i>b</i>, <b>85</b><i>c</i> can deflect outwardly to permit a portion of the hopper actuating portions <b>84</b><i>a</i>, <b>84</b><i>b</i>, <b>84</b><i>c</i> to pass through the narrowed portion upon transition of the paddles <b>82</b><i>a</i>, <b>82</b><i>b</i>, <b>82</b><i>c</i> to the engaged (e.g., lowered) position (see, e.g., hopper actuating portions <b>82</b><i>b</i> and <b>82</b><i>c</i> in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b>K</figref>). The flexible extensions can return to an undeflected position (e.g., the position illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b>K</figref>) to form the seats <b>81</b><i>a</i>, <b>81</b><i>b</i>, <b>81</b><i>c</i>. The seats <b>81</b><i>a</i>, <b>81</b><i>b</i>, <b>81</b><i>c</i> can retain the paddles <b>82</b><i>a</i>, <b>82</b><i>b</i>, <b>82</b><i>c</i> in the engaged position through, for example, physical interference with the hopper actuating portions <b>84</b><i>a</i>, <b>84</b><i>b</i>, <b>84</b><i>c</i>.</p>
<p id="p-0210" num="0209">The paddles <b>82</b><i>a</i>, <b>82</b><i>b</i>, <b>82</b><i>c</i> can be manually transitioned to the disengaged position from the engaged position by lifting on the paddles <b>82</b><i>a</i>, <b>82</b><i>b</i>, <b>82</b><i>c</i> with sufficient force to permit the hopper actuating portions <b>84</b><i>a</i>, <b>84</b><i>b</i>, <b>84</b><i>c</i> to pass down through the narrowed portion (e.g., by forcing the flexible extensions of the tracks <b>85</b><i>a</i>, <b>85</b><i>b</i>, <b>85</b><i>c</i> outward).

<p id="p-0211" num="0210"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>3</b>A-<b>3</b>J</figref> illustrate an exemplary embodiment of a hopper assembly <b>300</b> and its various components. The hopper assembly <b>300</b> provides a controlled dose of beverage material to the grinder assembly <b>500</b>. The controlled dose can vary based on a number of factors, including, but not limited to, the type of beverage material stored in the hopper assembly <b>300</b>, a size of the desired beverage, or the type of the desired beverage.</p>
<p id="p-0212" num="0211">In general, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b>G</figref>, the hopper assembly <b>300</b> can include an outer housing having an upper body portion <b>302</b> and a lower body portion <b>304</b>. The upper and lower body portions <b>302</b>, <b>304</b> can define an interior volume that can receive the beverage material. Although <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b>G</figref> illustrates the upper and lower body portions <b>302</b>, <b>304</b> as separate components, the upper and lower body portions <b>302</b>, <b>304</b> can be integrally formed. An auger <b>308</b> can be disposed at least partially within the outer housing and can deliver the controlled dose of beverage material to the grinder assembly <b>500</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0213" num="0212">When fully assembled, the auger <b>308</b> can be at least partially disposed within the lower body portion <b>304</b>. An auger retainer <b>316</b> can secure an end of the auger <b>308</b> to the lower body portion <b>304</b>. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b>N</figref>, an auger coupling <b>310</b> can couple an end of the auger <b>308</b> to a hopper motor <b>34</b> that can drive the auger <b>308</b>. The auger coupling <b>310</b> and the auger retainer <b>316</b> can be coupled to a same end or different ends of the auger <b>308</b>. In certain configurations, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b>F</figref>, the hopper assembly <b>300</b> can include a visor <b>314</b> disposed along at least a portion of the auger <b>308</b>, such that the auger <b>308</b> is positioned between the visor <b>314</b> and the lower housing portion <b>304</b>. The visor <b>314</b> can prevent beverage material from being excessively pulled from the center of hopper assembly <b>300</b>. Further, the visor <b>314</b> in combination with the auger <b>308</b> can prevent beverage material from inadvertently falling through the outlet <b>312</b> when the auger <b>308</b> is inactive. Although the visor <b>314</b> is illustrated as a separate component, the visor <b>314</b> can be integrally formed with the lower body portion <b>304</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0214" num="0213">The hopper motor <b>34</b> can turn the auger <b>308</b> in a clockwise or a counterclockwise direction. For example, the hopper motor <b>34</b> can turn the auger <b>308</b> in a first direction to dispense the beverage material from the hopper assembly <b>300</b>, and the hopper motor <b>34</b> can turn the auger <b>308</b> in a second direction to move beverage material away from the hopper assembly outlet <b>312</b>. The ability to rotate the auger <b>308</b> in the second direction allows the user to move beverage material away from the outlet <b>312</b> before removing the hopper assembly <b>300</b> from the beverage apparatus <b>2</b>. This minimizes the likelihood that beverage material will spill out of the hopper assembly <b>300</b> when the hopper assembly <b>300</b> is disengaged from the beverage apparatus <b>2</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0215" num="0214">Further, if the hopper assembly <b>300</b> is completely empty and refilled with beverage material, the initial rotation of the auger <b>308</b> will not release any beverage material from the hopper assembly <b>300</b> because there is no beverage material disposed in the flutes near the outlet <b>312</b>. Thus, to improve dose accuracy, it can be desirable to rotate the auger <b>308</b> in the second direction between each beverage to return the auger <b>308</b> to an initial position, for example, in which there is no beverage material retained in the flutes near the outlet <b>312</b>. With a repeatable and known initial position (i.e., known coffee volume in the flutes), it is more likely that the dose will be consistent from beverage to beverage.</p>
<p id="p-0216" num="0215">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b>A</figref>, the hopper assembly <b>300</b> can be shaped such that the length L and height H of the hopper assembly <b>300</b> are substantially larger than a width W of the hopper assembly <b>300</b>. For example, each of the length L and the height H can be at least about three times, at least about four times, or at least about five times greater than the width W of the hopper assembly <b>300</b>. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b>A</figref>, this hopper assembly <b>300</b> configuration makes it possible to include a multiple number of hopper assemblies <b>300</b> on a single beverage apparatus <b>2</b>. The narrow width W allows the barista to see the proximal face <b>354</b> of each hopper assembly <b>300</b>, while still limiting the width of the counter space necessary for the beverage apparatus <b>2</b>. In some embodiments, the width W can be less than or equal to about 10 inches, preferably less than or equal to about 5 inches, for example, 4 inches, 3 inches, or 2 inches.</p>

<p id="p-0218" num="0217">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b>G</figref>, the distal face <b>354</b> can be a removable hopper door <b>306</b> to provide access to the interior volume of the hopper assembly <b>300</b>, which can be useful for refilling the beverage material. The hopper door <b>306</b> can be secured to the lateral sides <b>356</b> of the upper body portion <b>302</b> using screws, a hinge, a snap fit, a friction fit, or any other suitable connection mechanism. In other configurations, access to the interior volume of the hopper assembly <b>300</b> can be disposed along the proximal face <b>352</b>, lateral sides <b>356</b>, an upper portion, or a lower portion of the upper body portion <b>302</b> (e.g., by removing the lower body portion <b>304</b>).</p>
<p id="p-0219" num="0218">In some configurations, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b>A</figref>, the proximal face <b>352</b> can extend further than the distal face <b>354</b>, such that the lower body portion <b>304</b> can be secured to the upper body portion <b>302</b> without extending past a bottom edge of the proximal face <b>352</b>. The extension portion <b>344</b> can include a lip portion <b>346</b> for mating with a corresponding lip portion <b>337</b> on the lower body portion <b>304</b>. Further, one or more engagement features (e.g., lip, ridge, protrusion, indentation, groove, or opening) can extend intermittently or continuously along at least a portion of a bottom edge of one or both lateral sides of the upper body portion <b>302</b>. For example, the upper body portion <b>302</b> can include an inward facing ridge <b>342</b> that can support an outward facing ridge <b>350</b> on the lower body portion <b>304</b>. In some configurations, the upper body portion <b>302</b> can include an outward facing ridge <b>340</b> for engaging a corresponding outward facing ridge <b>340</b> on another hopper assembly <b>300</b> or the hopper retainer <b>8</b>.</p>

The outlet <b>312</b> can be positioned anywhere along the lower body portion <b>304</b>, for example, at a central portion of the lower body portion <b>304</b>. A portion <b>336</b> of the lower body portion <b>302</b> can extend over the outlet <b>312</b> to define a space through which the auger <b>308</b> can extend. The portion <b>336</b> can help maintain the position of the auger <b>308</b>. Further, the visor <b>314</b> can be secured to the portion <b>336</b> and over the auger <b>308</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0224" num="0223">The auger holder portion <b>330</b> can include a number of grooves <b>335</b>, indentations, or likewise, to retain the position of the auger <b>308</b>. For example, each groove <b>335</b> can have a width sized to retain a portion (e.g., a single rotation) of the screw thread <b>324</b>. The grooves <b>335</b> can be positioned anywhere along a length of the auger holder portion <b>330</b>. For example, the auger holder portion <b>330</b> can include one or more grooves <b>330</b> at one or both ends of the auger holder portion <b>330</b> and/or at or near a center of the auger holder portion <b>330</b>. The auger holder portion <b>330</b> can include one groove, two grooves, three grooves, or more at each position. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b>I</figref>, the auger holder portion <b>330</b> can include a groove <b>335</b> at each end of the auger holder portion <b>330</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0225" num="0224">The grooves <b>335</b> retain the position of the auger <b>308</b>, while still making it easy to remove the auger <b>308</b> from the lower body portion <b>302</b> for cleaning. The grooves <b>335</b> are also sized for easy cleaning, so beverage material is not stuck in the grooves <b>335</b>. Further, the hopper assembly <b>300</b> has a minimal total number of parts for easy disassembly.</p>
<p id="p-0226" num="0225">Although not shown, in other configurations, the auger holder portion <b>330</b> can include one or more protrusions for retaining the position of the auger <b>308</b>. Each protrusion can be sized to fit between two rotations of the screw thread.</p>
<p id="p-0227" num="0226">The extension portion <b>331</b> can extend from the second end <b>333</b> of the auger holder portion <b>330</b>. The extension portion <b>331</b> can include one or more engagement features <b>348</b> (e.g., lip, ridge, protrusion, groove, indentation, or opening) for engaging a corresponding engagement feature, such as the inward facing ridge <b>342</b> on the upper body portion <b>302</b>. The extension portion <b>331</b> can be shaped to engage the upper body portion <b>302</b> while providing a space for the hopper motor <b>34</b> at least partially below the upper body portion <b>302</b> and distal to the lower body portion <b>304</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0228" num="0227">The hopper motor <b>34</b> can be positioned anywhere distal to the hopper assembly <b>300</b>, below the hopper assembly <b>300</b>, lateral from the hopper assembly <b>300</b>, proximal to the hopper assembly <b>300</b>, or above the hopper assembly <b>300</b>. In some configurations, the lower body portion <b>304</b> does not include an extension portion <b>331</b>, and the lower body portion <b>302</b> has a length less than a length of the upper body portion <b>302</b>, such that the hopper motor <b>34</b> can still be positioned at least partially below the upper body portion <b>302</b> and distal to the lower body portion <b>304</b>. In other configurations, the lower body portion <b>304</b> can have a length that is substantially the same as the upper body portion <b>302</b>, such that the hopper motor <b>34</b> is positioned distal to both the upper and lower body portions <b>302</b>, <b>304</b> or below the lower body portion <b>304</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0229" num="0228"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b>H</figref> illustrates an exemplary embodiment of the auger <b>308</b> including an inner core <b>323</b> and a screw thread <b>324</b> at least partially surrounding the inner core <b>323</b>. The auger <b>308</b> can be tapered so that the auger <b>308</b> pulls beverage material substantially evenly from the hopper assembly <b>300</b>. With conventional auger-based beverage apparatuses, beverage material is often pulled excessively from one or both ends of the hopper until a mound of beverage material remains at the center of the hopper. Once the beverage material at each end is exhausted, the auger cannot dispense any beverage material even though a mound of beverage material remains at the center of the hopper.</p>
<p id="p-0230" num="0229">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b>H</figref>, the auger <b>308</b> can include a first end <b>320</b> and a second end <b>321</b>.

<p id="p-0232" num="0231">The inner core <b>323</b> and the screw thread <b>324</b> can include a same material or different materials. For example, the inner core <b>323</b> can include stainless steel and the screw thread <b>324</b> can be injection molded around the inner core <b>323</b> using nylon, PVC, polymers, ceramics, or any combination thereof. As another example, the inner core <b>323</b> and the screw threads <b>324</b> can each include nylon, PVC, polymers, ceramics, or any combination thereof.</p>
<p id="p-0233" num="0232">Manufacturing the auger <b>308</b> can include a two-step injection molding process. First, the inner core <b>323</b> can be injection molded using nylon, PVC, polymers, ceramics, or any combination thereof.

<p id="p-0234" num="0233">The tapered inner core <b>323</b> can include a first tapered portion <b>328</b> and a second tapered portion <b>329</b>. The first tapered portion <b>328</b> can extend from a first end <b>320</b>  toward a central portion <b>326</b>. The second tapered portion <b>328</b> can extend from a second end <b>321</b> toward the central portion <b>326</b>. The inner core portions <b>328</b>, <b>329</b> can be separately formed or integrally formed to form a single auger <b>308</b> component. Further, each portion <b>328</b>, <b>329</b> can extend along about one-half a length of the auger <b>308</b>, one-third, one-fourth, or any other fraction of the length of the auger <b>308</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0235" num="0234">The first portion <b>328</b> can be tapered in a first direction, and the second portion <b>329</b> can be tapered in a second direction that is opposite the first direction. For example, the first portion <b>328</b> can be tapered in direction A toward the central portion <b>326</b>, and the second portion <b>329</b> can be tapered in direction B toward the central portion <b>326</b>. The first and second portions <b>328</b>, <b>329</b> can be tapered to the same degree, such that the inner core <b>323</b> is symmetrical. To evenly deliver beverage material from the hopper assembly <b>300</b>, each of the first and second portions <b>328</b>, <b>329</b> can be tapered at an angle of at least about 1 degree and/or less than or equal to about 10 degrees, for example between about 1 degree and 5 degrees, such as about 3 degrees. A smallest diameter D<sub>1</sub> of the tapered portion can be less than or equal to about 75% of a largest diameter D<sub>2</sub> of the tapered portions <b>328</b>, <b>329</b>, such as less than or equal to about 70%, 65%, 60%, 55%, 50%, 45%, or 40%.

The first and second threaded portions <b>318</b>, <b>319</b> can form a continuous screw thread or form separate screw threads. In some configurations, there can be more than two threaded portions. Further, although the screw thread <b>324</b> is shown extending along substantially the entire length of the auger <b>308</b>, in other configurations, the screw thread <b>324</b> may extend continuously or intermittently along only a portion of the auger <b>308</b>, but preferably, along at least a majority of the length of the auger <b>308</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0238" num="0237">In some configurations, the auger <b>308</b> can include a tapered inner core <b>323</b>, while still maintaining a substantially uniform outermost diameter Z. The diameter Z of the auger <b>308</b> can be less than or equal to about 3 inches, less than or equal to about 2 inches, or less than or equal to about 1 inch.

<p id="p-0248" num="0247">One or more hopper assemblies <b>300</b> can connect to the brewing assembly <b>400</b> via a chute <b>358</b> (shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b>P</figref>). The chute <b>358</b> can provide a passageway from one or more hopper assembly outlets <b>312</b> to the grinder assembly opening <b>502</b>. Although <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b>P</figref> illustrates a single chute <b>358</b>, the beverage apparatus <b>2</b> can include multiple chutes leading to a single grinder assembly <b>500</b> or separate grinder assemblies <b>500</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0249" num="0248">In some configurations, there can be a grinder assembly <b>500</b> for each hopper assembly <b>300</b>. However, it can be desirable to use one grinder assembly <b>500</b> for at least two hopper assemblies <b>300</b>, for example, two, three, four, five, or more hopper assemblies <b>300</b>. Using a single grinder assembly <b>500</b> for multiple hopper assemblies <b>300</b> can reduce the amount of space required for the grinder assemblies <b>500</b>, reduce the cost of goods, reduce points of failure, and reduce the amount of necessary calibration.</p>
<p id="p-0250" num="0249"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>5</b>A-<b>5</b>E</figref> illustrate different views of the grinder assembly <b>500</b>. The grinder assembly <b>500</b> can grind the beverage material to a controlled ground size.

<p id="p-0251" num="0250">The grinding mechanism illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>5</b>A-<b>5</b>E</figref> is a burr grinder, but other grinding mechanisms, such as a blade grinder or a roller grinder can be used. The grinder assembly <b>500</b> can include a grind adjustment mechanism to adjust the distance between the burrs <b>514</b>. The grind adjustment mechanism can be driven by a motor and belt system (not shown). The motor can drive a gear <b>506</b> to adjust the distance between the burrs <b>514</b>.

<p id="p-0252" num="0251">The grinder assembly <b>500</b> can continue to grind beverage material until there is no beverage material retained in the grinder assembly <b>500</b>. In certain aspects, the grinder assembly <b>500</b> can continue to grind beverage material until there is no beverage material retained between the hopper assembly <b>300</b> and the grinder outlet <b>510</b>. In other words, the grinder assembly <b>500</b> can grind the entire amount of beverage material released from the hopper assembly <b>300</b>. This feature can be beneficial for a beverage apparatus <b>2</b> having multiple hopper assemblies <b>300</b> connected to a single grinder assembly <b>500</b> to prevent cross-contamination of different beverage materials.</p>
<p id="p-0253" num="0252">Ground material can be transferred from the grinder assembly <b>500</b> to the brew chamber <b>402</b> through the grinder outlet <b>510</b>. Once the ground material enters the brew chamber <b>402</b>, the ground material can be mixed with water. However, if the water (e.g., steam or condensation) enters the grinder assembly <b>500</b>, the grinder assembly <b>500</b> can rust or ground material can get wet and clog the grinder assembly <b>500</b>. As such, it can be desirable to position a fan <b>702</b> near the grinder outlet <b>510</b> to create positive pressure to displace water vapor (see <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b>N</figref>).</p>

This configuration provides positive pressure across the entire grinder outlet <b>510</b> and grinder cap outlet <b>708</b> to ensure water vapor does not escape into the grinder assembly <b>500</b>. The baffle <b>712</b> can also direct air at the center of the burr region, so the ground material stays closer to a periphery of the grinder outlet <b>510</b>. Although the baffle <b>712</b> is shown in connection with the grinder cap <b>700</b>, the baffle <b>712</b> can be a separate component from the grinder cap <b>700</b> or grinder assembly <b>500</b>.</p>

In some embodiments, the lead screw wiper <b>429</b> can be translationally fixed (e.g., in the distal, proximal, left, right, and/or vertical directions) to the distal end <b>412</b> of the brew frame <b>408</b>. For example, a wiper collar <b>431</b> or other structure can translationally fix the lead screw wiper <b>429</b> to the brew frame <b>408</b>. In some embodiments, the wiper collar <b>431</b> permits rotation of the lead screw wiper <b>429</b> about the longitudinal axis of the lead screw <b>436</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0286" num="0285">In some embodiments, the lead screw wiper <b>429</b> includes a plurality of wiper portions <b>430</b> generally sized and shaped to fit within the screw threads of the lead screw <b>436</b>. The wiper portions <b>430</b> can ride in the screw threads of the lead screw <b>436</b> as the lead screw <b>436</b> moves in the distal direction. In some embodiments, the wiper portions <b>430</b> inhibit or prevent at least some particulates (e.g., coffee grounds) from accessing the plow drive nut <b>438</b>. Inhibiting or preventing particulates from accessing the plow drive nut <b>438</b> can reduce the risk of the drive nut <b>438</b> and lead screw <b>436</b> jamming as the drive nut <b>438</b> rotates. The lead screw wiper <b>429</b> can be constructed from a thin and/or flexible material. For example, the lead screw wiper <b>429</b> can be constructed from a polymer, a thin metal material, or some other suitable material.</p>
<p id="p-0287" num="0286">As illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>9</b>C-<b>9</b>F</figref>, the plow assembly <b>432</b> can include a lead screw <b>1436</b> which can be driven by a lead screw drive nut <b>1438</b>.

In some embodiments, the clip <b>1440</b> can inhibit or prevent inadvertent detachment of the lead screw <b>1436</b> from the drive nut <b>1438</b> via over-extension of the lead screw <b>1436</b> from the drive nut <b>1438</b> in the proximal direction.</p>
<p id="p-0288" num="0287">In some embodiments, a lead screw wiper <b>1429</b> is connected to the drive nut <b>1438</b>. For example, the lead screw wiper <b>1429</b> can be positioned within a wiper cavity <b>1431</b> (e.g., an annular cavity at or near the proximal end of the drive nut <b>1438</b>). The wiper <b>1429</b> can operate in the same or a similar manner to the lead screw wiper <b>429</b> described above. In some embodiments, interference between the lead screw wiper <b>1429</b> and the walls of the wiper cavity <b>1431</b> inhibit movement of the wiper <b>1429</b> in the proximal and distal directions with respect to the drive nut <b>1428</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0289" num="0288">The drive nut <b>1438</b> can be rotationally connected to a drive sleeve <b>1442</b>.

The recessions/protrusions <b>1446</b>  of the drive nut <b>1442</b> can be configured to spline-fit with protrusions <b>1448</b> and/or recessions <b>1450</b> on an inner surface of the drive sleeve <b>1442</b>. Interferences between the respective recessions and protrusions of the drive nut <b>1438</b> and drive sleeve <b>1442</b> can inhibit or prevent rotation of the drive nut <b>1438</b> with respect to the drive sleeve <b>1442</b>. In some embodiments, rotational force applied to the drive sleeve <b>1442</b> via a pulley, gear, or other drive mechanism, is transferred via the spline-fitting to the drive nut <b>1438</b> to move the lead screw <b>1436</b> in the proximal and/or distal directions.</p>
<p id="p-0290" num="0289">In some embodiments, as illustrated, the recessions and protrusions of the drive nut <b>1438</b> and drive sleeve <b>1442</b> permit proximal and/or distal movement of the drive nut <b>1438</b> with respect to the drive sleeve <b>1442</b>. The drive nut <b>1438</b> and/or drive sleeve <b>1442</b> can include one or more retention structures (e.g., flanges, shoulders, protrusions, cavity-plate combinations, etc.) configured to inhibit or prevent proximal and/or distal movement of the drive nut <b>1438</b> with respect to the drive sleeve <b>1442</b> during operation of the beverage apparatus <b>2</b>. For example, the drive nut <b>1438</b> can include a cavity <b>1452</b> configured to removably receive a plate <b>1454</b> or clip configured to inhibit movement of the drive nut <b>1438</b> with respect to the drive sleeve <b>1442</b>. One or more of the retention structures can be configured to be removable (e.g., removable by a repair person, barista, or any other user of the apparatus <b>2</b>). In some embodiments, removal of the plate <b>1454</b> permits proximal removal of the drive nut <b>1438</b> from the drive sleeve <b>1442</b>.</p>

The plow blade <b>444</b>  can be removable from the plow head <b>434</b>. For example, the plow blade <b>444</b> can be configured to slide into and out of the plow head <b>434</b> in a direction substantially parallel to the length of the plow head <b>434</b>. In some embodiments, the plow blade <b>444</b> is configured to be flexed into and out of engagement with the plow head <b>434</b>.</p>

The brew piston <b>426</b> can include one or more filter features <b>490</b> that permit passage of liquid (e.g., brewed coffee, brewed tea, water) through the brew piston <b>426</b> as the brew piston <b>426</b> transitions between the lowered and raised positions. In some embodiments, the filter features inhibit passage of grounds (e.g., coffee or tea grounds) through the brew piston <b>426</b>. In some embodiments, transition of the brew piston <b>426</b> to the raised position lifts substantially all of the grounds to the top of the brew piston <b>402</b>. As illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b>E</figref>, the top surface of the brew piston <b>426</b> can be substantially coplanar with the top surface of the brew frame plate <b>413</b> when the brew piston <b>426</b> is in the raised position.</p>

In some embodiments, transition of the plow <b>434</b> from the distal position to the proximal position pushes the grounds over the disposal edge <b>424</b> into the waste container <b>422</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0301" num="0300">The plow <b>434</b> and/or the plow blade <b>444</b> can interact with the plow wiper <b>446</b> (e.g., with the wiper blade <b>448</b>) as the plow <b>434</b> transitions to the proximal position. For example, the plow <b>434</b> can be shaped such that the plow <b>434</b> (e.g., the proximal surface of the plow <b>434</b> when the plow <b>434</b> is installed in the apparatus) tapers in the distal direction from the top of the plow <b>434</b> to the bottom of the plow <b>434</b>. In some embodiments, the proximal surface of the plow <b>434</b> is substantially planar with a distal slope from the top of the plow <b>434</b> to the bottom of the plow <b>434</b>. In some embodiments, as illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>4</b>C-<b>4</b>F</figref>, the proximal surface of the plow <b>434</b> is curved in the proximal direction from the bottom of the plow <b>434</b> to the top of the plow <b>434</b>. In some embodiments, a slope of the proximal surface of the plow <b>434</b> and/or of the plow blade <b>444</b> can increase (e.g., increase slope in the downward vertical direction) from a proximal portion of the of proximal surface of the plow <b>434</b> and/or of the plow blade <b>444</b> to a distal portion of the proximal surface of the plow <b>434</b> and/or of the plow blade <b>444</b>. The proximal end of the proximal surface of the plow <b>434</b> can have a small radius of curvature (e.g., less than 0.2 inches, less than 0.1 inches, less than 0.05 inches, less than 0.025 inches, and/or less than 0.01 inches). In some embodiments, proximal end of the proximal surface of the plow <b>434</b> can have a sharp edge.</p>
<p id="p-0302" num="0301">As illustrated, the proximal surface of the plow <b>434</b> and/or of the plow blade <b>444</b> can have a substantially constant cross-section in a vertical plane parallel to the drive screw <b>436</b> along the width of the plow <b>434</b> and/or plow blade <b>444</b> (e.g., the plow <b>434</b> and/or plow blade <b>444</b> can be substantially straight in a direction substantially perpendicular to the axis of the drive screw <b>436</b>). In some embodiments, the wiper blade <b>448</b> can have a substantially straight distal edge substantially perpendicular to the plow drive screw <b>436</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0303" num="0302">The proximal end (e.g., the top of the proximal surface) of the plow <b>434</b> can interfere with the wiper blade <b>448</b> as the plow <b>434</b> transitions to the proximal position. The wiper blade <b>448</b> can be pushed downward along the proximal surface of the plow <b>434</b> and/or of the plow blade <b>444</b> as the plow <b>434</b> transitions to the proximal position. In some embodiment, the upward bias of the wiper blade <b>448</b> can increase the contact force (e.g., pressure) between wiper blade <b>448</b> and the proximal surface of the plow <b>434</b> and/or of the plow blade <b>444</b>. Increased contact force between wiper blade <b>448</b> and the proximal surface of the plow <b>434</b> and/or of the plow blade <b>444</b> can increase the likelihood that most or substantially all of the grounds accumulated on the proximal surface of the plow <b>434</b> and/or of the plow blade <b>444</b> as the plow <b>434</b> transitions to the proximal position are wiped from the proximal surface of the plow <b>434</b> and/or of the plow blade <b>444</b> and into the waste container <b>422</b>. As discussed above, the slope of the proximal surface of the plow <b>434</b> and/or of the plow blade <b>444</b> can increase in the distal direction. The slope of the proximal surface can accelerate the wiper blade <b>448</b> downward as the plow <b>434</b> moves in the proximal direction. For example, in cases where the proximal movement of the plow <b>434</b> is performed at a constant or substantially constant speed, the vertical travel (e.g., downward travel) of the wiper blade <b>448</b> is accelerated as the wiper blade <b>448</b> approaches the distal end of the plow <b>434</b> due to the increased slope of the proximal surface of the plow <b>434</b> and/or of the plow blade <b>444</b>. Vertical acceleration of the wiper blade <b>448</b> can be facilitated by the increased vertical movement per unit of time required as the wiper blade <b>448</b> follows the geometry of the proximal surface of the plow <b>434</b> and/or of the plow blade <b>444</b>. In some embodiments, interference between a lateral side portion of the wiper blade <b>448</b> and the plow <b>434</b> can accelerate the wiper blade <b>448</b> off of the plow blade and/or off of the plow blade <b>444</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0304" num="0303">The wiper blade <b>448</b> can return to the upward position as the plow <b>434</b> transitions from the proximal position to the distal position.

For example, the mixing valve <b>800</b> and/or fill nozzle inlet <b>802</b> can spray the top surface of the brew piston <b>426</b>. The brew piston <b>426</b> (e.g., a periphery thereof) can be used to wipe the inner surface of the brew chamber <b>402</b> as the brew piston <b>426</b> moves vertically.

In some case, the hot water system <b>130</b> includes one or more sleeves (not shown) in the system manifold to reduce water volume in the manifold. Reducing water volume in the manifold can increase the operating pressure range of the hot water system <b>130</b>. In some embodiments, one or more aerators can be positioned within one or more of the fluid paths of the hot water system <b>130</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0314" num="0313">The hot water valve system <b>130</b> can dispense water (e.g., via the valve outlet <b>133</b>) at a plurality of water temperatures. In some embodiments, rotation of the valve shaft <b>146</b> (e.g., via manipulation of the lever <b>144</b>) can cause the cams <b>148</b>, <b>150</b> to open one or both of the valves <b>140</b>, <b>142</b> varying amounts. For example, rotation of the shaft <b>146</b> a first amount can open the cold water valve <b>140</b> a first percentage and can open the hot water valve <b>142</b> a second percentage. The first percentage and second percentage can be the same or different. In some embodiments, one or more the first percentage and second percentages is zero. The temperature of the water input into the valve chamber <b>132</b> will be proportional to the amount of hot and cold water input through the valves <b>140</b>, <b>142</b>. Rotation of the shaft <b>146</b> a second amount can open the cold water valve <b>140</b> a third percentage and can open the hot water valve <b>142</b> a fourth percentage. The third percentage can be greater than, less than, or equal to the fourth percentage. In some embodiments, the third percentage is different from the first and second percentages. One or both of the third and fourth percentages can be zero. In some embodiments, the lever <b>144</b> and/or valve shaft <b>146</b> is biased to a closed position via a biasing structure (e.g., a torque spring <b>156</b>). In the closed position, both the cold and hot water valves <b>140</b>, <b>142</b> can be maintained in a closed position.</p>

According to some variants, the valve outlet manifold <b>470</b> and valve plate <b>464</b> are formed (e.g., molded or extruded) as a monolithic part.</p>
<p id="p-0320" num="0319">The valve outlet manifold <b>470</b> can include a manifold sealing structure to inhibit fluid leakage between the valve manifold <b>470</b> and the lower brew plate <b>406</b> from within the brew chamber <b>402</b>.

<p id="p-0337" num="0336">In general, as described in greater detail above, the apparatus <b>2</b> can be activated by selecting one or more hopper assemblies <b>300</b> (using the hopper selector assembly <b>80</b>) and/or selecting a beverage size (using the beverage size control assembly <b>60</b>). After the apparatus <b>2</b> is activated, the hopper assembly <b>300</b> can dispense a controlled dose of beverage material based on the selected hopper and/or beverage size.</p>
<p id="p-0338" num="0337">The controlled dose can enter the grinder assembly <b>500</b> via a chute <b>358</b>. The grinder assembly <b>500</b> can be set to a specific grind size based on the hopper selection and/or beverage size selection. After the grinder assembly <b>500</b> grinds the beverage material, the beverage material can flow through the mixing valve <b>800</b> and into the brew chamber <b>402</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0339" num="0338">As the beverage material exits the mixing valve <b>800</b>, the mixing valve <b>800</b> can direct multiple, angled jets of water toward the ground material to immediately wet and agitate the grinds.

During or after the ground material fills the brew chamber <b>402</b>, additional water can be optionally delivered from the fill nozzle <b>806</b>. In certain aspects, water delivered from the fill nozzle <b>806</b> can be at a higher temperature than water delivered from the mixing valve <b>800</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0340" num="0339">After the beverage material steeps, the brew piston <b>426</b> can move upward, such that the beverage exits the brew chamber <b>402</b>. The brew outlet valve <b>462</b> can transition to the first valve position such that the brew chamber <b>402</b> is in fluid communication with the dispenser assembly <b>110</b> to dispense the beverage.</p>
<p id="p-0341" num="0340">After the beverage exits the brew chamber <b>402</b>, the plow assembly <b>432</b> can move the spent ground material to the waste bin <b>422</b>. The plow assembly <b>432</b> can passively drive a wiper <b>446</b> to fully wipe the ground material from the plow head <b>434</b> to the waste bin <b>422</b>.

<heading level="1" id="h-0019">Recipe Parameters</heading>
<p id="p-0345" num="0344">In some applications, it might be advantageous to modify the flavor profile of the brewed beverage. Varying water temperature, brew time, grind size, and/or dose ratio during a single brew cycle or between different brew cycles can modify the flavor of a brewed beverage. For example, water having a higher temperature tends to speed up extraction and produce a stronger, more aggressive flavor. Water having a lower temperature tends to slow down extraction and produce coffee having a mellower flavor. Water temperature may be varied during the brewing process through flow rate of the water, providing water at different temperatures, and/or providing water at different times during the brewing process.</p>
<p id="p-0346" num="0345">The ability to adjust grind size can be used to modify the flavor profile of a brewed beverage. A coarser grind tends to slow down extraction from the coffee grounds and to produce a relatively mellow coffee. A finer grind tends to increase extraction speed and produce coffee having a stronger flavor. In some embodiments, grind adjustment mechanism can adjust the grind size during the steep process to mix the differently sized coffee grinds.</p>
<p id="p-0347" num="0346">The beverage apparatus <b>2</b> can modify recipe parameters (e.g., water temperature, brew time, grind size, or dose ratio) based on different settings. For example, the beverage apparatus <b>2</b> can modify recipes based on economics. If the hopper assembly <b>300</b> is low on beverage material, then the user can change the settings to decrease the dose ratio. In some instances, the beverage apparatus <b>2</b> can include a sensor to detect when the beverage material in the hopper assembly <b>300</b> is low. The beverage apparatus <b>2</b> can automatically reduce the dose ratio when the sensor detects a low amount of beverage material.</p>
<p id="p-0348" num="0347">As another example, the beverage apparatus <b>2</b> can modify recipes based on geographical environments. For higher elevations, the beverage apparatus can modify the recipe to compensate for the lower boiling point, for example, by lowering the water temperature for the recipe and increasing the steep time or increasing the dose ratio.</p>
<p id="p-0349" num="0348">In some embodiments, the beverage apparatus <b>2</b> can modify recipes based on store traffic. During peak times, the beverage apparatus can increase the dose ratio, shorten the brew time, make a finer grind size, and/or skip at least some cleaning cycles. During low traffic times, the beverage apparatus can decrease the dose ratio, increase the brew time, and/or make a coarser grind size.</p>
<p id="p-0350" num="0349">The beverage apparatus <b>2</b> may also include settings to modify a base beverage recipe depending on individual requests from a customer. For example, the recipe can be modified if a customer requests extra room for cream or requests the beverage to be at a higher temperature.</p>
<heading level="1" id="h-0020">Terminology</heading>
<p id="p-0351" num="0350">For expository purposes, the term &#x201c;horizontal&#x201d; as used herein is defined as a plane parallel to the plane or surface on which the device being described is used or the method being described is performed, regardless of its orientation. The term &#x201c;vertical&#x201d; refers to a direction perpendicular to the horizontal as just defined. Terms such as &#x201c;above,&#x201d; &#x201c;below,&#x201d; &#x201c;bottom,&#x201d; &#x201c;top,&#x201d; &#x201c;side,&#x201d; &#x201c;higher,&#x201d; &#x201c;lower,&#x201d; &#x201c;upper,&#x201d; &#x201c;over,&#x201d; and &#x201c;under,&#x201d; are defined with respect to the horizontal plane.</p>
<p id="p-0352" num="0351">As used herein, the relative terms &#x201c;proximal&#x201d; and &#x201c;distal&#x201d; shall be defined from the user facing the controls. Thus, proximal refers to the side of the machine with the user-operable controls and distal refers to the opposite side of the machine.</p>
<p id="p-0353" num="0352">Conditional language, such as &#x201c;can,&#x201d; &#x201c;could,&#x201d; &#x201c;might,&#x201d; or &#x201c;may,&#x201d; unless specifically stated otherwise, or otherwise understood within the context as used, is generally intended to convey that certain embodiments include, while other embodiments do not include, certain features, elements, and/or steps. Thus, such conditional language is not generally intended to imply that features, elements, and/or steps are in any way required for one or more embodiments, whether these features, elements, and/or steps are included or are to be performed in any particular embodiment. The terms &#x201c;comprising,&#x201d; &#x201c;including,&#x201d; &#x201c;having,&#x201d; and the like are synonymous and are used inclusively, in an open-ended fashion, and do not exclude additional elements, features, acts, operations, and so forth. Also, the term &#x201c;or&#x201d; is used in its inclusive sense (and not in its exclusive sense) so that when used, for example, to connect a list of elements, the term &#x201c;or&#x201d; means one, some, or all of the elements in the list.</p>
<p id="p-0354" num="0353">The terms &#x201c;approximately,&#x201d; &#x201c;about,&#x201d; and &#x201c;substantially&#x201d; as used herein represent an amount close to the stated amount that still performs a desired function or achieves a desired result.
