<heading id="h-0002" level="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">The invention relates generally to shrimp processing, in particular the singulating and separating of shrimp before subsequent processing.</p>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">Shrimp processors sort shrimp by weight because larger shrimp can be sold at a higher price than smaller shrimp. Grading, sorting or other processing systems may require shrimp to be singulated and separated prior to processing. Because shrimps, especially peeled shrimps, are wet and somewhat sticky, they tend to adhere to each other. Touching or piggy-backed shrimps can cause problems for subsequent processes, such as vision grading. Other products may also require separation and singulation prior to a process, such as grading.</p>
<heading id="h-0003" level="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">One version of an apparatus embodying features of the invention for separation and singulating a batch of a product comprises a divider pan that separates a layer of product into several lanes of product, a shaker pan that receives the lanes of product and agitates them to separate clumps of product and a flume for providing further singulation and acceleration of the individual product. The singulated, separated objects are then sent to a processor, such as a grader.</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">According to one aspect, an apparatus for singulating a batch of a product comprises a conveyor for conveying the product, a divider pan positioned below an outfeed end of the conveyor for receiving the product and dividing the product into a plurality of lanes of product and a plurality of flumes positioned to receive the plurality of lanes of product. The flumes provide a flow of water to accelerate the product to separate and singulate the product.</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">According to another aspect, an apparatus for singulating a batch of a product comprises a conveyor for conveying the product, a divider pan positioned below an outfeed end of the conveyor for receiving the product and dividing the product into a plurality of lanes of product and a plurality of flumes positioned to receive the plurality of lanes of product. The flumes accelerate the product to separate and singulate the product. The divider pan comprises an angled back wall, a plurality of upper dividing walls on the angled back wall forming upper channels and a plurality of lower dividing walls below the upper dividing walls forming lower channels.</p>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">According to another aspect, an apparatus for singulating a batch of a product comprises a conveyor for conveying the product, a divider pan positioned below an outfeed end of the conveyor for receiving the product and dividing the product into a plurality of lanes of products and a plurality of flumes positioned to receive the plurality of lanes of product.

<heading id="h-0005" level="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION</heading>
<p id="p-0027" num="0026">The invention will be described below relative to certain illustrative embodiments, though the invention is not limited to the illustrative embodiments. For example, the separation and singulation system is not limited to shrimp, but can be used to separate and singulate any suitable product prior to further processing.</p>
<p id="p-0028" num="0027">A shrimp processing system embodying features of the invention is shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>. A shrimp singulation and separation portion of the overall system is shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>2</b> and <b>3</b></figref>. The illustrative shrimp processing system <b>10</b> includes a bulk feed tank <b>12</b> for holding a batch of shrimp or other product to be processed. A flighted, inclined conveyor belt <b>20</b> pulls shrimp out of the bulk feed tank <b>12</b>. The shrimp fall off the outfeed end of the flighted, inclined conveyor belt into a secondary feed tank <b>30</b>, which distributes shrimp on an inclined conveyor belt <b>36</b> to prepare for singulation.</p>
<p id="p-0029" num="0028">The secondary feed tank <b>30</b> may include an oscillating paddle <b>32</b> and a plunging paddle <b>34</b> to facilitate the distribution of a single layer of shrimp on the inclined conveyor belt <b>36</b>. The inclined conveyor belt <b>36</b> may be inclined at any suitable angle, preferably between about 10&#xb0; and about 20&#xb0; from horizontal, though the invention is not so limited. An example of an oscillating paddle <b>32</b> can be found in U.S. Pat. No. RE34646, the contents of which are herein incorporated by reference. An example of a suitable plunging paddle <b>34</b> can be found in U.S. Pat. No. 9,132,969, the contents of which are herein incorporated by reference. The oscillating paddle <b>32</b> creates a wave-like motion to spread the product out onto the inclined conveyor belt <b>36</b>, while the plunging paddle <b>34</b> creates a single, even layer of the product on the inclined conveyor belt <b>36</b>.</p>
