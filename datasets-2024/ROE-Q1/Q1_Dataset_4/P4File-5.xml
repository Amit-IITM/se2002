<p id="p-0002" num="0001">The disclosure relates to an antimicrobial spray composition for protecting, coating, or covering surfaces, for extended antimicrobial effects killing microorganisms upon contact with the surfaces.</p>
<heading id="h-0002" level="1">BACKGROUND</heading>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">Microorganisms are inherently present in the environment. Some microorganisms are beneficial to humans, and others are harmful as diseases spreading microbes, e.g., viruses, bacteria. With the spread of contagious diseases, it becomes necessary to protect people and prevent the people from coming into contact with the diseases spreading microbes.</p>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">In the prior art, the disinfection of surfaces is carried out either with traditional methods like liquid solutions such as sodium hypochlorite (bleach/chlorine) and alcohol at 70-90%, or ultraviolet (UV) radiation which can destroy the DNA of the virus. However, the treatment is short-term.</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">There is a need for a longer-term solution, for the protection of surfaces such as clothing, fabrics, carpet, furniture, linens, luggages, tents, upholstery, or basically high-contact surfaces, etc., in a spray form. After the composition is sprayed on a surface, it forms a film or a coating staying on the surface on for at least 24 hrs., preferably at least 1 month, and more preferably at least 2 months, providing extended antimicrobial protection.</p>
<heading id="h-0003" level="1">SUMMARY</heading>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">In one aspect, an antimicrobial spray composition is disclosed. The spray composition comprises: a carrier fluid selected from water, solvents, liquid polymers, and combinations thereof; a binder; and a sulfonated polymer. The sulfonated polymer is selected from the group of perfluorosulfonic acid polymers, polystyrene sulfonates, sulfonated block copolymers, sulfonated polyolefins, sulfonated polyimides, sulfonated polyamides, sulfonated polyesters, sulfonated polysulfones, sulfonated polyketones, sulfonated poly(arylene ether), and mixtures thereof. The spray composition, when applied onto a substrate for a thickness of at least &#x3e;1 &#x3bc;m, subsequently dries to form a film for killing at least 90% microbes within 120 minutes of contact with the film.</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">In some aspects, the antimicrobial spray composition is used to disinfect hard and soft surfaces.</p>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">In some aspects, the disclosure relates to a method to sterilize and prevent transmission of microbes from a surface prone to exposure to microbes. The method comprises forming a protective self-sterilizing layer on the surface, by spraying on the surface a protective composition. The protective composition comprises: a carrier fluid selected from water, solvents, liquid polymers, and combinations thereof; optionally a binder; and a sulfonated polymer being selected from the group of perfluorosulfonic acid polymers, polystyrene sulfonates, sulfonated block copolymers, sulfonated polyolefins, sulfonated polyimides, sulfonated polyamides, sulfonated polyesters, sulfonated polysulfones, sulfonated polyketones, sulfonated poly(arylene ether), and mixtures thereof; the sulfonated polymer has a degree of sulfonation of at least 10%. The protective composition subsequently dries on the surface to form a protective self-sterilizing layer, having a thickness of at least &#x3e;1 &#x3bc;m for killing at least 90% microbes within 120 minutes of contact with the self-sterilizing layer.</p>

<heading id="h-0004" level="1">DESCRIPTION</heading>
<p id="p-0009" num="0008">The following terms used in the specification have the following meanings:</p>
<p id="p-0010" num="0009">&#x201c;Microorganisms&#x201d; or &#x201c;microbes&#x201d; refer to organisms with microscopic size including bacteria, molds, mildews, algae, archaea, fungi (yeasts and molds), algae, protozoa, and viruses including coronavirus.</p>
<p id="p-0011" num="0010">&#x201c;Antimicrobial&#x201d; refers to the ability of any composition contemplated by the disclosure to inhibit the growth of or to kill microorganisms such as without limitation bacteria, fungi, mildew, mold, and algae.</p>
<p id="p-0012" num="0011">&#x201c;Substrate&#x201d; refers to a layer under something else to provide support, having at least one surface available to deposit or coat a material of the choice.</p>
<p id="p-0013" num="0012">&#x201c;Anti-fog&#x201d; refers to the prevention or inhibition of build-up of condensation on a surface, e.g., a lens or a window, or a glass door, with an anti-fog coating. Anti-fog property can be expressed by T<sub>fog</sub>, which is the time in minutes it takes to form a fog on a surface, e.g., exposing a layer (surface) to steam from boiling water at a 20 centimeter distance from the water's surface in an environment of 50% RH (relative humidity) and 22&#xb0; C. If a surface has a T<sub>fog </sub>of at 30 minutes, it means that no fog is formed on a surface of said coating within about 30 minutes under the testing conditions described.</p>
<p id="p-0014" num="0013">&#x201c;Effective amount&#x201d; refers to an amount sufficient to alter, destroy, inactivate, neutralize and/or inhibit growth of microorganisms, e.g., an amount sufficient to sterilize and kill microorganisms in contact with the sulfonated polymeric layer applied to a substrate.</p>
<p id="p-0015" num="0014">&#x201c;Ion Exchange Capacity&#x201d; or IEC refers to the total active sites or functional groups responsible for ion exchange in a polymer. Generally, a conventional acid-base titration method is used to determine the IEC, see for example International Journal of Hydrogen Energy, Volume 39, Issue 10, Mar. 26, 2014, Pages 5054-5062, &#x201c;Determination of the ion exchange capacity of anion-selective membrane.&#x201d; IEC is the inverse of &#x201c;equivalent weight&#x201d; or EW, which the weight of the polymer required to provide 1 mole of exchangeable protons.</p>
<p id="p-0016" num="0015">&#x201c;Surface pH&#x201d; refers to the pH on the contact surface of the bio-secure material, that results from surface bound moieties e.g., the coating layer. The surface pH can be measured with commercial surface pH measuring instruments, e.g., SenTix&#x2122; Sur-electrode from WTW Scientific-Technical Institute GmbH, Weilheim, Germany.</p>
<p id="p-0017" num="0016">&#x201c;Dispersed or dispersion, or emulsion&#x201d; refers to a two-phase system wherein one phase comprises finely divided particles distributed throughout a second phase, which is a bulk substance. The particles are the disperse or internal phase, and the bulk substance the continuous or external phase. The continuous phase can be water, an aqueous mixture, or an organic mixture. By &#x201c;dispersion,&#x201d; it is also meant that not necessarily all of the polymer needs to be water-insoluble.</p>
<p id="p-0018" num="0017">The disclosure relates to an antimicrobial composition that can be sprayed onto surfaces, e.g., fabrics, carpet, chairs, linens, luggage, tents, upholstery, etc. The antimicrobial composition comprises, consists essentially of, or consists of a sufficient amount of sulfonated polymer, a carrier fluid, and optional binder, such that when the composition is sprayed on a surface, it forms a protective layer or film on the surface killing least 95% microorganisms that come into contact with the surfaces. The protective layer remains effective for a long period of time, for at least 4 hours, or at least 48 hours, at least a month, or 2 months.</p>
<p id="p-0019" num="0018">Self-sterilizing Material&#x2014;Sulfonated Polymer: Sulfonated polymer refers to polymers having a sulfonate group, e.g., &#x2014;SO<sub>3</sub>, either in the acid form (e.g., &#x2014;SO<sub>3</sub>H, sulfonic acid) or a salt form (e.g., &#x2014;SO<sub>3</sub>Na). The term &#x201c;sulfonated polymer&#x201d; also covers sulfonate containing polymers, e.g., polystyrene sulfonate.</p>
<p id="p-0020" num="0019">The sulfonated polymer is selected from the group of perfluorosulfonic acid polymers (e.g., sulfonated tetrafluoroethylene), sulfonated polyolefins, sulfonated polyimides, sulfonated polyamides, sulfonated polyester, polystyrene sulfonates, sulfonated block copolymers, sulfonated polyolefins, sulfonated polysulfones such as polyether sulfone, sulfonated polyketones such as polyether ether ketone, sulfonated polyphenylene ethers, and mixtures thereof.</p>
<p id="p-0021" num="0020">The sulfonated polymer is characterized as being sufficiently or selectively sulfonated to contain from 10-100 mol % sulfonic acid or sulfonate salt functional groups based on the number of monomer units or the block to be sulfonated (&#x201c;degree of sulfonation&#x201d;), to kill at least 95% of microbes within 120 minutes of coming into contact with the coating material. In embodiments, the sulfonated polymer has a degree of sulfonation of &#x3e;25 mol %, or &#x3e;50 mol %, or &#x3c;95 mol %, or 25-70 mol %. Degree of sulfonation can be calculated by NMR or ion exchange capacity (IEC).</p>
<p id="p-0022" num="0021">In embodiments, the sulfonated polymer is a sulfonated tetrafluoroethylene, having a polytetrafluoroethylene (PTFE) backbone; (2) side chains of vinyl ethers (e.g., &#x2014;O&#x2014;CF<sub>2</sub>&#x2014;CF&#x2014;O&#x2014;CF<sub>2</sub>&#x2014;CF<sub>2</sub>&#x2014;) which terminate in sulfonic acid groups in a cluster region.</p>

The solvent and optionally the co-solvent from the emulsion is mixed to produce an aqueous emulsion to mix with other components of the spray composition.</p>
<p id="p-0078" num="0077">Spray Applications: Depending on the type of binder used, the carrier, the sulfonated polymer employed, the concentrations of the components, and ambient conditions (e.g., temperature and humidity) the spray composition effectively forms an antimicrobial layer or film on substrate surfaces in &#x3c;6 hours, or &#x3c;4 hours, or &#x3c;2 hours, or &#x3e;5 minutes, providing antimicrobial protection by killing at least 95%, or at least 99.%, or at least 99.5% of microorganisms in &#x3c;30 minutes of exposure, or &#x3c;5 minutes of exposure, with the antimicrobial protection lasting at least 30 days, or 60 days.</p>
<p id="p-0079" num="0078">Surfaces herein refers to all hard and soft surfaces, including but not limited to tiles, floor materials, chrome, glass, vinyl products, plastics, wood, metals, metal alloys, laminates, etc.; building materials (e.g., doors, door knobs, walls, etc.), facilities (e.g., building, offices, etc.), fabrics (e.g., clothing, curtains, drapes, etc.); furniture (e.g., chairs, seats, trays, etc.); medical devices; laboratory equipment; appliances, etc.</p>
<p id="p-0080" num="0079">The spray composition can be formulated into various suitable spray forms. For example, the spray composition may be packaged using a manual spray distributor, e.g., a trigger spray distributor or a pump-type spray distributor. Spray distributors evenly apply the present composition onto a relatively wide area of a surface to be disinfected and thus contribute to the antimicrobial property of the present composition. Such spray distributors are especially suitable for disinfection of perpendicular surfaces.</p>
<p id="p-0081" num="0080">For home use, the spray composition can be employed or dispensed from pressurized can that is equipped with a nozzle so that an aerosol of the formulation can be readily sprayed onto a surface. The pressure within the dispenser or pressurized can is preferably in the range of 10 to 100 psi at ambient conditions.</p>
<p id="p-0082" num="0081">In embodiments, the spray composition is used with a &#x201c;fog machine&#x201d; which aerosolizes the composition onto surfaces, e.g., as in a room, an airplane cabin, etc. periodically, e.g., every few days, every few weeks, every month, every other month, etc., including the ceilings, seats, trays, floors, rest areas, galleys, etc. The spray composition can also be applied by an automatic fog machine for periodic spraying of surfaces in a room, or used in a AI (artificial intelligence) robot spray machine for periodic spraying/providing antimicrobial protection for selective surfaces in a building or a room, e.g., certain walls, doorknobs, furniture, etc., in an operating room, a hospital, a medical facility, and the like. The composition can also be for home use, with periodic spraying of highly touched surfaces, door knobs, mailboxes, etc.</p>
<p id="p-0083" num="0082">Example 1: Tests were conducted to evaluate antimicrobial efficacy &#x26; the long-lasting antiviral properties of sulfonated polymers, film samples of sulfonated penta block copolymer (SPBC) of the structure poly[tert-butylstyrene-b-(ethylene-alt-propylene)-b-(styrene-co-styrene-sulfonate)-b-(ethylene-alt-propylene)-tert-butylstyrene] with 52% sulfonation were cast out of 1:1 mixture of toluene and 1-propanol. The sulfonated polymer film samples were subjected to abrasion testing of 2200 cycles in the presence of 3 common disinfectants: 1) 70% ethanol, benzalkonium chloride, and quaternary ammonia], and exposure to SARS-CoV-2 virus suspension of concentration 10<sup>7 </sup>pfu/ml.</p>
<p id="p-0084" num="0083">After 2 hours of contact, viable virus was recovered from each sample by washing twice with 500 &#x3bc;l of DMEM tissue culture media containing 10% serum, and measured by serial dilution plaque assay. Gibco Dulbecco's Modified Eagle Medium (DMEM) is a basal medium for supporting the growth of many different mammalian cells. The results demonstrate that, after abrasion testing representing approximately one year of cleaning (6 disinfectant wipes/day), surface pro Gibco Dulbecco's Modified Eagle Medium (DMEM) is a widely used basal medium for supporting the growth of many different mammalian cells.</p>
<p id="p-0085" num="0084">Example 2: The example was conducted to evaluate the effectiveness in inhibiting <i>Aspergillus niger </i>black mold according to the AATCC Test Method 30-2004 Test III. Six different sulfonated block copolymer membrane samples comprising a poly[tert-butylstyrene-b-(ethylene-alt-propylene)-b-(styrenesulfonate)-b-(ethylene-alt-propylene)-b-tert-butylstyrene], at different levels of sulfonation from 26 to 52% were used for the tests. <i>Aspergillus niger</i>, ATCC #6275, was harvested into sterile distilled water containing glass beads. The flask was shaken to bring the spores into suspension. The suspension was used as the test inoculum. One (1.0) mL of the inoculum was even distributed over the surface of Mineral Salts Agar plates. The membrane samples were placed onto the inoculated agar surface. After placement, 0.2 mL of the inoculum was distributed over the surface of each disc. A viability plate of the spore suspension was prepared on Mineral Salts Agar with 3% glucose. A positive growth control was prepared using an untreated cotton duck fabric on Mineral Salts Agar and set up in the same manner as the test items. All samples were incubated at 28&#xb0; C.&#xb1;1&#xb0; C. for 14 days.</p>
<p id="p-0086" num="0085">The viability plate had acceptable fungal growth as expected confirming the viability of the inoculum. The sample with 26% sulfonation showed microscopic growth on 10% of the sample surface. The other 5 test samples showed no growth, or microscopic growth on 1% of the surface. The control sample showed macroscopic growth on 100% of the surface.</p>
