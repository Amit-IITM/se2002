<abstract id="abstract">
<p id="p-0001" num="0000">A probe is configured with a flushing port and an evacuation port to establish a flow path to remove blood from a resected tissue. The probe comprises a balloon configured to expand and contact the resected tissue to compress filaments and improve access to the underlying blood vessels for coagulation with an energy source. An endoscope can be used to view the tissue, and the balloon may comprise a transparent material or a viewing port to allow imaging of the bleeding tissue through the balloon. The probe may have a light source to illuminate the tissue with a beam oriented at an oblique angle to the tissue surface, which can decrease interference from blood and may allow more localized coagulation of the blood vessel.</p>

<heading id="h-0002" level="1">BACKGROUND</heading>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">Work in relation to the present disclosure suggests that prior approaches to treating bleeding tissue with energy can be less than ideal in at least some respects. In some instances, bleeding tissue may comprise tissue with rough surfaces, which can make the bleeding tissue somewhat more difficult to treat. For example, blood may coagulate on the rough surface and decrease visibility of the underlying surface. Also, blood can potentially obscure light from an energy source such as a laser, which can result in less than ideal delivery of the light energy to a target tissue, such as a ruptured blood vessel. The rough surface may also make the distribution of light energy provided to the tissue somewhat less evenly distributed and the resulting coagulation less uniform than would be ideal.</p>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">Water jets can be used resect tissue with decreased bleeding. For example, a water jet can selectively resect tissue such as a glandular prostate tissue while leaving collagenous tissue such as blood vessels substantially intact. However, in some instances tissue resection with a water jet can lead to the penetration of blood vessels which can result in bleeding. In some instances, soft tissue such as glandular tissue also has collagenous connective tissue fibers that support the soft tissue. Work in relation to the present disclosure suggests that the resection of soft tissue with a water jet can leave collagenous tissue fibers after the soft tissue such as glandular tissue has been removed. These remaining collagenous tissue fibers can collect blood and interfere with hemostasis treatment in at least some instances. For example, the collagenous fibers can decrease visibility of a blood vessel, which may make placement of a hemostasis treatment less accurate than would be ideal. Also, blood collected by the fibers can at least partially interfere with the delivery of laser energy to the underlying blood vessel in at least some instances.</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">In light of the above, improve methods and apparatus are needed that ameliorate at least some of the limitations of the prior approaches.</p>
<heading id="h-0003" level="1">SUMMARY</heading>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">The presently disclosed, probes, methods and apparatuses can provide improved hemostasis to bleeding tissue and can be used for the treatment of bleeding tissue with residual collagenous fibers. In some embodiments, a probe is configured with a flushing port and an evacuation port configured to establish a flow path to remove blood from a resected tissue. In some embodiments, the probe comprises a balloon configured to expand and contact the resected tissue to compress filaments and improve access to the underlying blood vessels for coagulation with an energy source such as a laser beam. An endoscope can be used to view the tissue, and the balloon may comprise a transparent material to allow imaging of the bleeding tissue through the balloon. The endoscope may comprise a viewing port within the balloon or external to the balloon in order to image the tissue through the balloon. In some embodiments, the probe comprises a light source configured to illuminate the tissue with a beam oriented at an oblique angle to the tissue surface, which can decrease interference from blood and may allow more localized coagulation of the blood vessel. The probe can be manipulated in many ways and can be connected to one or more of a handpiece or a robotic linkage to move the energy source.</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">In some embodiments, the probe is coupled to a robotic linkage configured to receive instructions from a processor. The processor can be configured to receive an input corresponding to a location of a ruptured blood vessel and to scan the energy source with a pattern in relation to the location. The input can be determined in many ways and may comprise one or more of an input from an ultrasound image, a Doppler ultrasound image, an endoscopic image, an aiming beam on a probe, or a user input on an image of the tissue. In some embodiments, the processor is configured to scan the energy source at a distance from the location, which can be helpful in coagulating underlying blood at a distance from the ruptured opening to the blood vessel.</p>

<heading id="h-0006" level="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION</heading>
<p id="p-0065" num="0064">The following detailed description provides a better understanding of the features and advantages of the inventions described in the present disclosure in accordance with the embodiments disclosed herein. Although the detailed description includes many specific embodiments, these are provided by way of example only and should not be construed as limiting the scope of the inventions disclosed herein.</p>
<p id="p-0066" num="0065">The presently disclosed methods and apparatus are well suited for treating bleeding tissue that has been treated with an energy source. The energy source may comprise one or more of a laser beam, a water jet, an electrode, ultrasound, high intensity focused ultrasound, mechanical vibrations, radiofrequency (RF) energy an ultrasound transducer, microwave energy, cavitating energy such as a cavitating water jet or ultrasonic cavitations.</p>
<p id="p-0067" num="0066">Work in relation to the present disclosure suggests that the resection of tissue with a water jet can provide elongate collagenous filaments on the resected surface that are somewhat more resistant to tissue resection than other types of tissue. The presently disclosed methods and apparatus are well suited for treating tissue under such filaments, for example to provide tissue coagulation and hemostasis. For example, with the resection of prostate tissue for the treatment of benign prostate hyperplasia (&#x201c;BPH&#x201d;), the water jet resection can selectively resect tissue such as glandular tissue, while leaving collagenous tissue filaments. These collagenous filaments may also be referred to herein as fluffies because of the &#x201c;fluffy&#x201d; appearance of the collagenous fibers.</p>
<p id="p-0068" num="0067">While embodiments of the present disclosure are specifically directed to treatment of the prostate, certain aspects of the disclosure may also be used to treat and modify other organs and tissue such as brain, heart, lungs, intestines, eyes, skin, kidney, liver, pancreas, stomach, uterus, ovaries, testicles, bladder, ear, nose, mouth, soft tissues such as bone marrow, adipose tissue, muscle, glandular and mucosal tissue, spinal and nerve tissue, cartilage, hard biological tissues such as teeth, bone, as well as body lumens and passages such as the sinuses, ureter, colon, esophagus, lung passages, blood vessels, and throat. The devices disclosed herein may be inserted through an existing body lumen, or inserted through an opening created in body tissue.</p>
<p id="p-0069" num="0068">The presently disclosed methods and apparatuses can be configured in many ways to promote at least partial closure of blood vessels to decrease bleeding. In some embodiments, bleeding tissue is infused with laser absorption accelerator, such as a wavelength specific chromophore, which can be provided through one or more lumens used to provide fluid to a treatment location. The presently disclosed methods and apparatus can be configured to use decreased amounts of energy to promote hemostasis, for example with less energy than could be used for tissue ablation.</p>
<p id="p-0070" num="0069">The light energy can be provided by any suitable light source and may comprise any suitable wavelength or combination of wavelengths. For example, the light energy may comprise one or more of ultraviolet, visible, infrared, or near infrared electromagnetic energy. The light source may comprise one or more of a laser, a laser diode, a super luminescent diode, light bulb, a flash bulb, or a halogen bulb, for example. While the light source can be configured in many ways, in some embodiments, the light source is coupled to one or more optical fibers, and the light energy released from the one or more optical fibers toward the tissue.</p>
<p id="p-0071" num="0070">In some embodiments, a probe is configured to emit light having a wavelength for decreased tissue penetration for hemostasis, which can decrease nerve damage around delicate tissue structures such as the capsule of the prostate.</p>
<p id="p-0072" num="0071">The treatment probe can be configured in many ways, and in some embodiments is configured to release a fluid with relatively low laser attenuation compared to the target tissue. The fluid may comprise one or more of gas or a liquid. The gas may comprise air or carbon dioxide (CO<sub>2</sub>), for example. The liquid may comprise water, saline, or a mixture of water with another material.</p>
<p id="p-0073" num="0072">Work in relation to the present disclosure suggests that the prostate may tend to bleed more generally anteriorly toward the prostate capsule, for example at locations corresponding to 10 o'clock and 2 o'clock with the patient on a support. In some embodiments the target tissue is insufflated with an optically transmissive fluid and the treatment energy such as laser energy is directed to regions corresponding to 10 o'clock and 2 o'clock, for example with a treatment extending approximately &#xb1;20&#xb0; at each location.</p>
<p id="p-0074" num="0073">In some embodiments, a dye comprising a chromophore is delivered to the tissue. In some embodiments, the dye is delivered to the tissue with a fluid comprising of one or more of the water jet, a flushing fluid, or an insufflation fluid tissue. The dye may comprise a chromophore with a peak absorbance near a wavelength of the light energy (e.g. a treatment wavelength corresponding to an absorbance of at least half of the peak absorbance of the chromophore). This may provide depth of penetration control and surface temperatures to promote one or more of clot formation or vessel sealing, without excessive depth of penetration so as to decrease damage to tissues near the treatment site.</p>
<p id="p-0075" num="0074">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>, an exemplary prostatic tissue hemostasis apparatus <b>10</b> constructed in accordance with the principles of the present disclosure comprises a catheter assembly generally including a shaft <b>12</b> having a distal end <b>14</b> and a proximal end <b>16</b>. In some embodiments, the shaft <b>12</b> comprises one a polymeric extrusion or metallic tubes (and combinations thereof) including one, two, three, four, or more axial lumens extending from a hub <b>18</b> at the proximal end <b>16</b> to locations near the distal end <b>14</b>. The shaft <b>12</b> may be stiff, flexible or rigid. In some embodiments, the shaft <b>12</b> has a length in the range from 15 cm to 25 cm and a diameter in the range from 1 mm to 15 mm, usually from 2 mm to 10 mm. The shaft will typically have sufficient column strength so that it may be introduced upwardly through the male urethra, as described in more detail below.</p>
<p id="p-0076" num="0075">In some embodiments, the shaft includes an energy source positioned in the energy delivery region <b>20</b>, where the energy source can be any one of a number of specific components as discussed in more detail below. In some embodiments an inflatable balloon <b>24</b> is positioned near the distal end <b>14</b> of the shaft and extend over an energy release element at energy delivery region <b>20</b>. The balloon is connected through one of the axial lumens to a balloon inflation source <b>26</b>, the balloon inflation source can be of a piston driven fluid displacement device such as a fluid pump (e.g., peristaltic, gear, vane, piston, including a manual or motorized syringe delivering liquid or gas to a preselected volume or pressure to the balloon), connected through the hub <b>18</b>. In addition to the energy source <b>22</b> and the balloon inflation source <b>26</b>, the hub optionally further includes connections for an infusion/flushing source <b>28</b>, an aspiration (a vacuum) source <b>30</b>, and/or an insufflation (pressurized gas such as CO<sub>2 </sub>or a liquid such as saline) source <b>32</b>. In the exemplary embodiment, the infusion or flushing source <b>28</b> can be connected through an axial lumen (not shown) to one or more delivery ports <b>34</b> proximal or distal to the balloon <b>24</b> and distal to the energy delivery region <b>20</b>. The aspiration source <b>30</b> can be connected to a second port or opening <b>36</b>, which can be positioned proximally of the energy delivery region <b>20</b> or distally to the energy delivery region <b>20</b>. The insufflation source <b>32</b> can be connected to an additional port <b>38</b>, which can be located proximal or distally relative to the energy delivery region. It will be appreciated that the locations of the ports <b>34</b>, <b>36</b>, and <b>38</b> are not critical, although certain positions may result in particular advantages described herein, and that the lumens and delivery means could be provided by additional catheters, tubes, and the like, for example including coaxial sleeves, sheathes, and the like which could be positioned over the shaft <b>12</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0077" num="0076">In some embodiments, the hemostasis apparatus <b>10</b> comprise an endoscope <b>21</b> to allow visualization of the tissue proximate energy delivery region <b>20</b>. The endoscope <b>21</b> is configured to allow visualization of the treatment site. The endoscope <b>21</b> may comprise an optical port for viewing the treatment site. The optical port may comprise one or more lenses to receive light from the treatment site, for example. The optical port may be located within balloon <b>24</b> or external to balloon <b>24</b>. The balloon <b>24</b> comprises an optically transmissive material to allow visualization of the treatment site through the balloon with at least one wavelength of light. In embodiments where the viewing port is located within the balloon <b>24</b>, the endoscope is configured to view the treatment site from an interior of the balloon. In embodiments where the endoscope viewing port is located outside the balloon, the endoscope views the treatment site with light transmitted through the balloon at two or more locations, in which one location is near the treatments site and the other location is near the endoscope.</p>
<p id="p-0078" num="0077">The balloon on the probe can be configured in many ways. In some embodiments, the balloon in the narrow profile configuration comprises one or more of an approximately cylindrical shape within 25% of the probe diameter, a balloon comprising a diameter larger than a shaft of the probe and a tapered shape profile near a distal end of the balloon to facilitate advancement of the probe, or a balloon wrapped around the shaft to decrease a cross-sectional size of the balloon.</p>
<p id="p-0079" num="0078">Referring now to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>2</b>A to <b>2</b>D</figref>, the prostatic tissue hemostasis apparatus <b>10</b> is introduced through the male urethra U to a region within the prostate P which is located immediately distal to the bladder B. The anatomy is shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b>A</figref>. In some embodiments, a volume V of the tissue of the prostate P has been resected to a resection profile RP. While the prostate can be resected in many ways, in some embodiments the prostatic tissue is resected with a water jet.</p>
<p id="p-0080" num="0079">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b>B</figref>, once the catheter <b>10</b> has been positioned so that the balloon is placed in proximity to the resection profile RP, fluid flow FL can be provided to the resected prostate. In some embodiments, the fluid flow comprises the release of fluid through port <b>34</b> on one side of the balloon, e.g. distal to the balloon <b>24</b>, and evacuation of the fluid on another side of the balloon, e.g. proximal to the balloon, although the arrangement can be reversed. This flow of fluid can facilitate the removal of blood that may otherwise interfere with treatment of the blood vessels with energy and allow improved visualization of the source of bleeding.</p>
<p id="p-0081" num="0080">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b>C</figref>, the balloon <b>24</b> is inflated. The inflation of the balloon can displace material such as blood from the resected volume of tissue V. In some embodiments, the position of the prostatic tissue hemostasis apparatus <b>10</b> is fixed and stabilized within the resected volume V so that the energy delivery region <b>20</b> is positioned within the prostate P.</p>
<p id="p-0082" num="0081">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b>D</figref>, after the balloon <b>24</b> has been inflated, energy E can be delivered into the prostate for hemostasis, as shown by the arrows in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b>D</figref>. Once the energy has been delivered for a time and over a desired surface region, the energy region can be stopped and the prostate is treated for hemostasis to substantially decrease bleeding. In embodiments in which the source of the energy is light based, it may also be configured to use alternating signals to apply treatment and diagnose the efficacy of that treatment. For example, if laser energy is applied, it can use alternating wavelength signals of energy for treatment and transmission/receiving signals to measure the temperature of the zone of hemostasis. Further embodiments may include two or more fibers of different wavelengths, such that the first fiber may be used to apply treatment while the second fiber may be used to measure the temperature of the zone of hemostasis simultaneously by infrared, tissue color change, visual cues or other means. A positive feedback loop may be created such that the first fiber will halt treatment once the tissue temperature has reached the target required to achieve hemostasis.</p>
<p id="p-0083" num="0082"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b>E</figref> shows a treatment probe with an endoscope configured to view a treatment site from an interior of a balloon <b>24</b>. The endoscope <b>21</b> comprises a viewing port <b>202</b> oriented to receive light from the treatment region and image the treatment region with the balloon <b>24</b> inflated. The port <b>36</b> is located on one side of the balloon, e.g. proximally. The energy deliver region <b>20</b> comprises carrier <b>380</b> configured to deliver energy E along an energy delivery path as described herein. The carrier <b>380</b> can be configured in many ways to deliver energy and can be configured to translate along an elongate axis of the carrier and to rotate about the elongate axis of the carrier <b>380</b>, for example. The carrier <b>380</b> can be coupled to a linkage as described herein, or operated manually, for example with a handle. A wall defining one or more lumens of the shaft <b>12</b> may comprise an aperture to inflate the balloon and allow the treatment site to be imaged with the viewing port of the endoscope. Alternatively or in combination, openings <b>220</b> can be provided to allow inflation of the balloon <b>24</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0084" num="0083">Although <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b>E</figref> shows the viewing port <b>202</b> of the endoscope <b>21</b> located on an interior of the balloon <b>24</b>, in some embodiments the endoscope viewing port is located on an exterior of the balloon. For example, the endoscope viewing port can be located proximally to the balloon and the port <b>36</b> located proximal to the viewing port to establish a fluid flow. The endoscope <b>21</b> and balloon <b>24</b> can be configured to view tissue through the balloon, and the balloon and inflation fluid may comprise a substantially transparent material, such as a substantially transparent liquid or a gas. The energy source and carrier <b>380</b> can be rotated and translated within the balloon to deliver energy to the tissue with the endoscope viewing port oriented toward the tissue so as to view the tissue through a first portion of the balloon proximate the endoscope viewing port and through a second portion of the balloon proximate the tissue. The fluid flow between the flush port and evacuation port can be established as described herein, so as to evacuate material such as blood and clots from the surgical site to improve visualization and access to tissue near the blood vessel and in some embodiments the blood vessel itself.</p>
<p id="p-0085" num="0084"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b>F</figref> shows a resection profile RP along a prostate and a resected blood vessel <b>210</b>. In some embodiments, the profile along the remaining tissue of the resection profile RP comprises tissue filaments <b>212</b> (&#x201c;fluffies&#x201d;). In some embodiments, the energy source used to selectively resect tissue while leaving other types of tissue. Work in relation to the present disclosure suggests that tissue resection with a water jet may remove some types of tissue, e.g. glandular tissue, more quickly than other tissue such as supportive tissue comprising relatively greater amounts of collagen fibers. The blood vessel extends to an opening <b>216</b> in the blood vessel generally along the resection profile. The opening of the blood vessel can release blood <b>214</b> into the volume V of resected tissue. The filaments can collect blood <b>214</b> and may comprise molecular structures that tend to induce blood clotting. In some embodiments, a plume <b>218</b> of blood is released into the resected volume V. The blood vessel is shown beneath the resection profile inclined at an oblique angle relative to the resected tissue profile. Because the blood released into the blood vessel can collect near the opening, work in relation to the present disclosure suggests that it can be helpful to treat tissue away from the opening to the blood vessel, so as to decrease energy absorbed by blood released from the vessel into the filaments and the resection volume.</p>
<p id="p-0086" num="0085"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b>G</figref> shows an energy scan pattern <b>230</b> suitable for treating a blood vessel <b>210</b> away from the opening along the resection profile. The distance <b>232</b> can be any suitable distance, for example a distance within a range from about 1 mm to about 10 mm, for example. The scan pattern may comprise one or more shapes, such as an annular scan pattern, a plurality of annuli, an ellipsoidal pattern, a spiral scan pattern or a raster scan pattern, and combinations thereof. A plurality of scan patterns can be applied to the tissue, for example a plurality of annuli of decreasing diameter.</p>
<p id="p-0087" num="0086">In some embodiments, the scan pattern may result in coagulation of the blood within the tissue and the blood vessel at a depth into the resected tissue and the vessel. Coagulating the blood deeper into the tissue, such as greater than 3 mm, 5 mm, 8 mm, 10 mm, or 15 mm into the tissue or vessel, aids in coagulation and stopping the bleeding out of the opening in the vessel as compared to only surface treatment.</p>

When the low power visible light energy beam is aligned with the vessel opening, the user can operate an input such as a foot pedal. In response to the user input that the aiming beam is aligned with the target opening, the processor can direct the energy delivery element to deliver the scan pattern <b>230</b> around the opening to the vessel.</p>

<p id="p-0112" num="0111">In some embodiments, when the target of interest for the treatment is identified and aligned with the aiming beam, the system mechanically locks in response to user input, so as prevent physician activated movement of robotic structures (e.g. actuators and linkages) so as to allow automated scanning of the treatment laser.</p>
<p id="p-0113" num="0112">In some embodiments, the method of treatment comprises identifying a central region of a target of interest and determining an area and shape to be treated based on expected underlying anatomy. For example, vessels may approach the surface area of interest at an angle to the treatment probe. Alternately or in combination, the direction of vascularity may be identified using doppler ultrasound.</p>
<p id="p-0114" num="0113">When the appropriate treatment pattern has been determined, the tissue is treated with an appropriate scan pattern <b>230</b>. The treatment pattern may comprise any suitable scan pattern <b>230</b> such as a circle, oval, an annulus, annuli, or a raster scan pattern for example. The treatment may start at an appropriate distance from the location identified by the user as described herein. For example, the scan pattern may start 3 mm from the identified target location (e.g. a center of interest) and the laser beam scanned in a circular pattern of 6 mm diameter with subsequent smaller and overlapping or not overlapping circles until finishing in the center.</p>
<p id="p-0115" num="0114">The treatment shape can be sized and dimensioned in many ways. For example a source of bleeding can be identified with a plume <b>218</b>, and the aiming laser or other pointing device used to identify the target location on an image of the tissue. The treatment pattern may comprise an oval shaped treatment area with the identified target (e.g. the source of bleeding) near the center of one end of the oval (e.g. a first focus of an ellipse) and the extend toward an expected location of underlying vascular anatomy (e.g. a second focus of an ellipse). The distance between the centers can determined based on an expected location of the blood vessel at a desired depth based on a model of vascular anatomy, for example.</p>
<p id="p-0116" num="0115">Using a Balloon</p>
<p id="p-0117" num="0116"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>6</b></figref> shows a balloon <b>24</b> with a substantially non-attenuating fluid <b>602</b> between a laser energy treatment probe <b>450</b> that emits a laser beam <b>602</b> and a target site of tissue <b>506</b>. The probe <b>450</b> comprises a shaft <b>12</b> that can be coupled to a handpiece or a linkage as described herein. The balloon <b>24</b> may comprise a compliant balloon or a non-complaint balloon, for example. The compliant balloon may comprise a material which follows the contour of the patient anatomy, such as the tissue <b>506</b>, when inflated to an appropriate pressure with a fluid. The fluid <b>602</b> can distend the balloon <b>24</b> such the balloon follows the contours of the resected tissue <b>506</b>, for example. The balloon can be filled with any suitable fluid such as a liquid or gas, e.g. CO<sub>2</sub>, or saline. In some embodiments, the fluid comprises a substantially non-attenuating fluid (e.g. no more than 10% attenuation between from the light energy source to the balloon), or predictably attenuating liquid. In some embodiments, the balloon material is thermally stable at the treatment temperatures and comprises an optically transmissive material. In some embodiments, the balloon comprises a transparent material for at least one wavelength of light to allow visualization of the treatment site. Alternatively or in combination, the balloon can be configured to substantially absorb the treatment energy (e.g. at least 50% of laser energy) so as to localize heating to tissue in proximity to the balloon. In some embodiments, the balloon comprises a material that is radio-frequency transparent and is configured to allow total or near total electromagnetic energy transmission through the balloon into the underlying tissue raising the temperature, such as to promote hemostasis.</p>
<p id="p-0118" num="0117">The balloon can be configured to gently press against the tissue to provide a more uniform treatment of the underlying tissue. For example, the balloon can press filaments toward the resected tissue surface. In some embodiments, by complying with the patient anatomy, loose tissue is pressed to the underlying tissue shape such as a resected tissue shape, so as to provide a more uniform surface for treatment. For example, remnant filaments (e.g. fluffy tissue) subsequent to water jet resection can be pressed with the balloon toward the resected tissue surface so as to compress the filaments tissue and allow a more direct delivery of laser energy to the underlying tissues to provide hemostasis or other treatment.</p>
<p id="p-0119" num="0118">In some embodiments, a substantially non-attenuating fluid results in decreased variation in energy delivered to the target tissue at different distances of transmission through the substantially non-attenuating fluid as compared with an attenuating fluid.</p>
<p id="p-0120" num="0119">In some embodiments, the fluid comprises at least some attenuation of the light energy, such as the light energy in the laser beam <b>502</b>, by a predictable amount, and the system can be configured to adjust the treatment irradiance in response to the attenuation. For example, an ultrasound imaging system or other imaging system can be used to determine the distance of light energy transmitted through the fluid from the output window to the tissue surface. The distance from emitting probe to tissue surface can be used to determine the power, duration, and motion appropriate to provide hemostasis or other therapy.</p>
<p id="p-0121" num="0120">With a non-compliant balloon, such as a cylindrical or cigar shaped balloon, which may have a known radius, the balloon can be inflated to achieve a known distance <b>604</b> from emitting probe to balloon surface, which can reduce variability of attenuation, as well as variability of angle of incidence of the light energy toward the location of treatment. In some embodiments, blood flow to the tissue is decreased with balloon pressure, which may provide more efficient heating and coagulation within the tissue related to decreased perfusion of the tissue.</p>
<p id="p-0122" num="0121">Blood Detection and Treatment</p>
<p id="p-0123" num="0122">In some embodiments, bleeding locations are visible in the images so as to allow identification of the target site. The target site can be identified in many ways, such as with human interface or machine vision identification of bleeding site. In some embodiments, the target site is identified by a user interface with the imaging system or artificial intelligence, such as machine vision. The treatment region is determined automatically and treatment automatically enabled. Alternatively or in combination, the treatment region can be verified by a physician. In some embodiments, the physician determines the treatment region as described herein.</p>

The inflated balloon can be coupled to a probe comprising a shaft as described herein that can be coupled to a handpiece or a linkage as described herein. The balloon <b>24</b> is deployed to contact and apply a compressive force <b>706</b> to residual tissue <b>702</b>, such as residual tissue filaments comprising collagen. In some embodiments, the balloon compresses the residual tissue <b>702</b> along the wall of the tissue surface, e.g. the resection profile <b>704</b>. In some embodiments, the active bleeding source, is visible through the balloon. The aiming laser beam can be directed to the opening of the vessel <b>210</b> based on blood in the image, so that the aiming laser beam is directed to the area of visible blood, e.g. substantially centered in the visible area of blood. Although reference is made to a laser beam, another marker can be used to identify the treatment area, such as a computer-generated marker. Using the energy delivery element as a laser pointer, the light energy beam may be coupled to a robotic control element. The laser pointer may be used to identify the source of bleeding. Once the source of bleeding is identified through direct visualization, the location can be identified and marked through a user input device on the console (e.g. point and click at the site of bleeding). Using the rotation of the energy element and axial drive of the shaft, the console may drive the energy source to the source of bleeding and apply energy to achieve hemostasis. In a separate embodiment, the robotically driven element may use the same or separate laser to measure distance to the tissue surface using Lidar or other optical methods such as optical coherence tomography (OCT) in order to ensure precise location of the energy delivery element.</p>

In some embodiments with an aqueous environment, the irrigation and evacuation (e.g. aspiration) capabilities of the treatment system as described herein can be used to generate a fluid flow to remove blood from the bleeding location. In some embodiments, a flow of working fluid induces blood to flow to improve access to the ruptured vessel. The flow of the fluid and blood can be oriented in any suitable direction, for example from the proximal endoscope viewing port toward the distal end of the probe near the bladder (toward the right). An evacuation port such as an aspiration port can be used to draw fluid from the endoscope viewing port and laser delivery element to clear the field of view and provide improved visualization. This removal of blood can also help to identify the location of bleeding from the vessel. This flow can allow a physician viewing the target area or vision system to identify the approximate location of bleeding.</p>

<p id="p-0127" num="0126"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>8</b>A</figref> shows an extendable optical fiber <b>804</b> deployed from an end of a lumen <b>802</b> of a probe <b>450</b>. The probe <b>450</b> comprises a shaft <b>12</b> that can be coupled to a handpiece or a linkage as described herein. The optical fibers <b>804</b> can be configured to deflect in a free form configuration, for example when extending from the lumen. The optical fiber can be advanced along the delivery lumen <b>802</b> in a substantially straight configuration, and then deflect when extending beyond the delivery lumen. The one or more optical fibers can be advanced and retracted to scan the laser energy along the tissue, such as along the movement direction <b>808</b>. The one or more optical fibers can be rotated to rotate the scan pattern, for example. In some embodiments, the optical fiber or a material external to the optical fiber comprise a spring-loaded bias so as to deflect the optical fiber extending from the end of the delivery lumen. For example, the optical fiber can be at least partially enclosed within a shaped tube, such as a sheath <b>806</b>, that deflects in a free-standing configuration, e.g. with a curvature or other suitable deflection. In some embodiments, the length of deployment of the curved tube provides for variable lateral offset. In some embodiments, the optical fiber can be advanced from the distal end of the lumen to contact tissue with deflection and a slight pressure to the tissue. The optical fiber can be advanced further if the tissue wall is located farther from the distal end of the lumen.</p>
<p id="p-0128" num="0127">In some embodiments, the optical fiber extends along a structure such as a tube with an internal channel, e.g. a lumen, sized to pass an irrigation fluid around the optical fiber within the lumen. The optical fiber and shaped tubular structure can be moved together within the delivery lumen to pass a flushing fluid toward the treatment location. The fluid delivery lumen may contain the optical fiber. Alternatively or in combination, the fluid delivery lumen may comprise a separate lumen from the lumen of the optical fiber. The fluid delivery lumen can be connected to a flushing source as described herein. In some embodiments, the fluid delivery lumen extends coaxially with the laser energy delivery optical fiber. The flushing fluid connected to and in proximity to the optical fiber promotes the presence of clear liquid in the path of the laser beam which provides more accurate delivery of energy to the target tissue.

The tissue engagement structure <b>810</b> may comprise a tissue contact surface dimensioned larger than a transverse cross-section of the optical fiber in order to decrease pressure to the tissue as compared to the optical fiber directly contacting tissue, which can allow the engagement structure coupled to the optical fiber to move more freely along the tissue surface than the optical fiber. The engagement structure <b>810</b> may comprise a curved contact surface to allow the engagement structure to move along the tissue, for example to slide along the tissue. The tissue contact surface of the engagement structure may comprise any suitable shape such as a cylindrical shape or a spherical shape, for example. The engagement structure may comprise two wheels adjacent to the fiber or a sphere or cylinder with the optical fiber positioned within. In some embodiments, the tissue engagement structure comprises a roller <b>814</b> configured to roll along the tissue surface with the distal end of the optical fiber spaced apart from the tissue. The optical fiber may be configured to deflect when advanced from an opening of a delivery lumen toward tissue. In some embodiments, the one or more optical fibers is at least partially enclosed in a housing, so as to deflect one or more optical fibers when advanced from a distal end of a delivery lumen.

The optical structure can be configured to provide beneficial distribution of light energy to the treated surface. The light from the exit aperture of the probe generally diverges toward the tissue so that the irradiance at the tissue surface may be lower than near the probe. In some embodiments, the approach provides a more uniform distribution of light energy delivered to the treated tissue. In some embodiments, the processor is configured with instructions to determine the distribution of light energy to the tissue in response to the distance to the tissue and the treatment time and movement of the probe to determine the desired treatment, e.g. hemostasis. The flow of fluid around the tissue may be taken into consideration in determining the treatment time. In some embodiments, there is relatively little fluid flow from urine or a flushing fluid and the treatment can be determined accordingly. Alternatively or in combination, fluid flow can be provided by urine or a flushing fluid as described herein, in which the irradiated tissue is cooled at least partially by fluid flow, e.g. convection.

In some embodiments the optical fiber extends along the lumen fluidically coupled to the nozzle <b>1210</b>. One or more support structures within the lumen can be configured to support the optical fiber with a bend within the lumen, for example. Alternatively or in combination, the optical fiber may extend along a separate lumen or channel of the probe that is spaced apart from the lumen coupled to the nozzle. In some embodiments, the probe comprises a distal end <b>14</b>, and the nozzle is located proximally to the distal end. In some embodiments, the light aperture in the probe to emit light is located proximally to the nozzle. Alternatively the light source can be located distally to the nozzle.</p>
<p id="p-0149" num="0148">The light beam can be emitted from the probe at any suitable angle. In some embodiments, the light beam is emitted from the probe at an oblique angle relative to the elongate axis <b>1250</b> of the probe, for example so as to provide oblique illumination as described herein. Alternatively or in combination, the light beam <b>502</b> can be emitted from the probe at an angle that is substantially perpendicular to an elongate axis of the probe, for example within approximately 15 degrees of perpendicular. In some embodiments, the light beam <b>502</b> is emitted at an angle to the elongate axis <b>1250</b> so as to overlap with the fluid stream, e.g. water jet, at a distance from the probe. In some embodiments, the light source comprises an optical fiber extending along the probe and wherein the optical fiber comprises a bend relative to an elongate axis of the probe in order to direct a light beam to the tissue at a non-parallel angle to the elongate axis of the probe. Alternatively, the optical fiber may comprise a bend of approximately 90 degrees to direct the beam at angle of approximately 90 degrees to the elongate axis of the probe.</p>
<p id="p-0150" num="0149">The probe comprising the light source and the nozzle can be configured in many ways. In some embodiments, the probe is configured to rotate about the elongate axis of the probe and to translate along the elongate axis. The first location and the second location are located along the probe at spaced apart locations and a similar rotational angle with respect to the elongate axis, and the probe is configured to translate the light source along the elongate axis to treat the region of tissue treated with the water jet.</p>
<p id="p-0151" num="0150">In some embodiments, the nozzle is aligned relative to an elongate axis of the shaft to direct the water jet to a first region of tissue, and the light source is aligned relative to the elongate axis to direct the light beam to a second region of tissue overlapping with the first region when the nozzle is directed toward the first region.</p>
<p id="p-0152" num="0151">In some embodiments, the shaft comprises a first side and a second side and wherein first side comprises the first location and the second location. In some embodiments, a midline of the probe separates the first side and the second side.</p>
<p id="p-0153" num="0152">In some embodiments, the nozzle to emit the fluid stream and light source are located along a midline of the probe and spaced apart axially. In some embodiments, the nozzle is located distally and the light source on the probe, e.g. optical fiber end, located proximally to the nozzle. With this configuration tissue can be resected with the water jet, and the probe subsequently advanced distally to coagulate the resected tissue with the light beam. Alternatively, the light source can be located distal to the nozzle and the probe retracted proximally to treat resected tissue with the light beam.</p>
<p id="p-0154" num="0153">In some embodiments, the light beam and fluid stream are configured to substantially overlap at a distance from the probe so as to allow substantially simultaneous treatment with the water jet and light beam. Alternatively or in combination, the light beam can be used to treat resected tissue with the light beam shortly after treatment with the water jet, for example within a few seconds of rejection with the water jet.</p>
<p id="p-0155" num="0154">In some embodiments, the probe comprising the optical fiber to emit a laser beam and high pressure lumen to release as water jet from a nozzle is coupled to a robotic linkage configured to resect tissue with the water jet and to coagulate tissue with the light energy from the optical fiber, such as laser energy from the optical fiber. A robotic linkage may be coupled to any treatment source, such as any energy source, and the robotic linkage can be used for imaging, treatment, distance measurement, cautery, or some other purpose or combination of purposes.</p>
<p id="p-0156" num="0155">Oblique Angle of Incidence</p>
<p id="p-0157" num="0156">While the laser probe can be configured in many ways, in some embodiments, the probe is configured to direct light energy toward tissue with an oblique angle of incidence, for example an oblique angle of incidence with respect to the surface of the tissue such as a surface of resected tissue. In some embodiments, light energy is transmitted to an underlying vessel to coagulate the vessel away from the vessel opening. This approach can have the benefit of decreasing obscuration of the light energy by blood located near the bleeding vessel. Although reference is made to an oblique angle with respect to the tissue surface, the oblique angle may comprise an angle within a range from about 15 degrees to about 75 degrees, for example within a range from about 30 degrees to about 60 degrees.</p>
<p id="p-0158" num="0157">Any of the probes described herein can be configured to emit light with an oblique angle of incidence. The oblique angle of incidence can be configured with the direction of flow and endoscope view to improve visibility and decrease obscuration of an underlying blood vessel. In some embodiments, the oblique angle of incidence and flow of the flushing fluid can be at least partially aligned in order to direct light in a direction similar to the direction of flow of the flushing fluid. For example, the probe opening coupled to the source of flushing fluid can be located proximally to the probe opening coupled to the evacuation lumen, e.g. the aspiration lumen, and the probe can be configured to direct light from the probe distally, such that the light beam propagates distally and radially outward and the flushing fluid flows distally from the probe. The endoscope viewing port can be configured to view distally from the probe, in order to view the tissue through the flushing fluid and displace blood away from the endoscope viewing port. Alternatively, the configuration can be reversed, such that fluid flows proximally, the evacuation port is located proximal to the flushing port, and the endoscope viewing port is oriented proximally.</p>
<p id="p-0159" num="0158"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>13</b></figref> shows an oblique angle of incidence of laser energy, such as a light beam <b>502</b>, with respect to a tissue resection profile <b>704</b> to delivery laser energy to a blood vessel <b>210</b> beneath the tissue resection profile. In some embodiments, the ruptured blood vessel <b>210</b> has underlying vascular structure which is substantially intact and undamaged and located away from the tissue resection surface and the opening to the vessel. This substantially undamaged portion of the vessel can be coagulated to decrease bleeding. The portion of the underlying blood vessel located beneath the resected tissue surface and tissue fibers <b>212</b> can be treated with decreased interference from blood released from the ruptured vessel, for example. Work in relation to the present disclosure suggests that blood vessels beneath the surface extend at an oblique angle to the surface, and oblique illumination of the vessel relative to the surface can provide illumination transverse to the vessel and may provide improved coagulation of the vessel.</p>
<p id="p-0160" num="0159">The laser beam <b>502</b> can be configured in many ways to treat a blood vessel <b>210</b> below the tissue surface <b>704</b>. In some embodiments, tissue scatters longer wavelengths of light less than shorter wavelengths of light, and the light source can be configured to emit light at an appropriate wavelength. Work in relation to the present disclosure suggests that light comprising a wavelength within a range from about 500 nm to about 600 nm can provide suitable penetration and absorbance of hemoglobin, although other wavelengths can be used. In some embodiments, the tissue penetration depth extends to about 10 mm. The tissue irradiance and duration can be configured to provide coagulation at a depth in the tissue. In some embodiments, the underlying vessel is targeted with the laser beam, for example with endoscopic visualization of the underlying vessel. The laser energy incident at an angle with the tissue can provide improved visualization and penetration of light from the surface of the target tissue, for example by viewing and targeting the tissue around the source of blood, e.g. the ruptured blood vessel. In some embodiments, the blood vessel is treated with a beam with an elongate cross-section as described herein, although other beam shapes can be used, such as a scanning circular spot. The oblique illumination and targeting of the blood vessel can provide the advantage of decreasing damage to adjacent tissue, such as thermal necrosis, by irradiating the blood vessel with decreased interference from blood, for example. Work in relation to the present disclosure also suggests that with the oblique illumination, the blood vessel can be oriented with an elongate axis of the blood vessel that is within about 45 degrees of perpendicular to the beam, which can provide a more localized coagulation of the blood vessel.</p>
<p id="p-0161" num="0160">The light energy used to treat tissue can be generated in many ways. In some embodiments, a laser is used to generate the light beam. The laser may comprise any suitable laser such as one or more of a gas laser, a liquid laser, a liquid dye laser, a solid-state laser, diode laser, a frequency doubled laser, a frequency mixed laser, a mode locked laser, or a diode pumped laser, for example. The laser may comprise a pulsed laser or a continuous laser. In some embodiments, the laser is coupled to an optical fiber that extends along the probe to direct energy to tissue as described herein. The laser can be configured to emit any suitable wavelength of light, such as one or more of ultraviolet, visible, or infrared light. In some embodiments, the laser comprises a pulsed Nd:YAG laser configured to emit light at 1064 nm, for example. Work in relation to the present disclosure suggest that in some tissues light of approximately 1000 nm has a penetration depth of approximately 1 cm in tissue, which can be well suited for use with oblique illumination or other suitable illumination as described herein.</p>

Alternatively or in combination, a robotic linkage can be used to move the laser beam over a treatment area as described herein before, during, or after a treatment. In some embodiments, the balloon and laser beam are configured to move together with the probe. For example, the elongate probe shaft can be configured to rotate and translate and the balloon and laser beam rotate and translate with the movement of the probe.

<p id="p-0171" num="0170"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>17</b></figref> shows tissue resection zones in accordance with some embodiments. Collagenous tissue such as blood vessels and connective tissue can be more fibrous and have greater strength than softer tissues. In some embodiments, the intensity of the water jet decreases with distance so as to remove different types of tissue with increasing distance from the nozzle. The tissue removal zones may comprise one or more of a collagen and soft tissue removal zone <b>1702</b>, a collagen disruption and soft tissue removal zone <b>1704</b>, or a collage preservation and soft tissue removal zone <b>1706</b>. The selective tissue resection zones may comprise a collagen disruption zone in which collagen is disrupted and substantially remains while soft tissue has been removed, and a collagen preservation zone in which collagenous tissue is substantially preserved and soft tissue removed. The power level of the water jet corresponds to flow rate through a nozzle. As the flow rate increases the power level increases. For lower amounts of power corresponding to lower amounts of flow through the nozzle, no tissue is removed. For increased amounts of power corresponding to the collagen preservation zone, collagen is preserved and soft tissue is removed. For increased amounts of power corresponding to increased flow through the nozzle, collagen is disrupted and soft tissue is removed. In some embodiments, the collagenous fibers described herein correspond to the collagen disruption zone. For further increased power collagen, including the fibers, is also removed.</p>
<p id="p-0172" num="0171">Although the water jet tissue resection can be configured in many ways, in some embodiments, the high velocity jet causes the tensile disassociation and mechanical lysing of cellular matrix on targeted tissues, such as soft tissues. At short distances corresponding to higher jet velocities (e.g. collagen removal zone) the tissues are broken to small fragments and distributed into the surrounding environment and evacuated as described herein. At greater distances from the nozzle the jet velocity decreases, and the selectivity becomes apparent showing tissues of lower tensile strength disassociated leaving higher tensile strength materials enduring the treatment and remaining attached. In some embodiments, with water jet tissue resection collagen fibers comprising a white cotton like tissue remains, which is visible in the surgical space and can be referred to fluffies.</p>
<p id="p-0173" num="0172">The tissue treated with the water jet may comprise one or more of fibers (elastic and collagenous fibers), ground substance and cells.

For example, the tissue resected may comprise cellular tissue held together with supporting tissue fibers, such as reticular fibers. Without being bound by any particular theory, in some embodiments the collagen fibers remaining after tissue resection comprise reticular fibers from which cells have been removed. In some embodiments, the reticular fibers comprise reticulin, which is a type of fiber located in connective tissue and composed of type III collagen secreted by reticular cells. Reticular fibers can crosslink to form a fine meshwork, e.g. reticulin. In some embodiments, this network acts as a supporting mesh in soft tissues such as liver, bone marrow, glandular prostate tissue and the tissues and organs of the lymphatic system.</p>

<p id="p-0197" num="0196">In some embodiments, the wire may have one, two, three, or more shape set bends <b>2204</b>. As one end of the wire is manipulated (e.g., pushed, pulled, rotated, or a combination) the wire may take on alternative shapes. In some instances, a loop may be sized by manipulating one or both ends of the wire. The wire may be used for numerous purposes, such as, but not limited to, capturing a tissue structure, delivering energy, guiding an energy delivery device, or some other purpose.</p>
<p id="p-0198" num="0197"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>24</b></figref> illustrates a wire <b>2202</b> that can be guided to a treatment site. In some cases, the wire may carry one or more electrodes <b>2402</b>. The electrodes may be activated provide targeted hemostasis. In some cases, multiple electrodes may be carried by the wire and used in combination for bipolar electro cautery and coagulation to a localized treatment site. Two or more electrodes may cooperate, with one driving conducting electrode and another ionically conductive phase. As an electric field is applied across the ionic phase, faradaic reactions occur at the ends of the bipolar electrode even though there may be no direction electrical connection between it and an external power supply. The bipolar electrodes may be used for targeted cautery, coagulation, or some other purpose to reduce heat injury to healthy tissue.</p>
<p id="p-0199" num="0198"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>25</b></figref> illustrates a guiding hollow wire <b>2200</b>. The guiding hollow wire <b>2500</b> may be an adjustable tubing loop <b>2200</b>, which may be adjusted as described herein, such as by pushing, pulling, rotating, or a combination of manipulations to one or two ends of the guiding hollow wire. The guiding hollow wire may be used as described above and may be shape set. The hollow guiding wire <b>2500</b> may be formed of any suitable material, and in some embodiments, is formed of Nitinol or spring steel. The hollow guiding wire may have a lumen <b>2502</b> therein that guides a fiber <b>804</b>, such as an optical fiber. The hollow guiding wire can be positioned and manipulated to locate the guiding wire at a target site, and the optical fiber can be fed through the hollow guiding wire to the target site. The hollow guiding wire may have one or more windows or apertures <b>2504</b> located within a wall of the hollow guiding wire to allow the optical fiber to emit energy through the window or aperture, such as in the form of a laser light beam <b>502</b>. In some cases, the optical fiber may be a laser which can be a side firing laser or an end firing laser. The hollow guide wire and window can be formed to deliver the optical fiber to the target location and in the proper orientation to deliver light energy to the target site. The energy source may traverse through the guiding hollow wire and deliver energy to the tissue from a distance controlled by the geometry of the adjustable member. For example, a laser fiber may traverse through a shape set nitinol tube, such that the geometry of the nitinol tube can control the fiber distance to the tissue to deliver the optimized energy required to achieve hemostasis. If the laser fiber is within too close of a proximity to the tissue, there is potential for adjacent tissue damage, and if the laser fiber is too far from the tissue surface, there is potential that insufficient energy is delivered to achieve hemostasis. By controlling the shape of the hollow guide tube, the optical fiber can be located to a degree of certainty sufficient to provide effective optical energy treatment to the target tissue.</p>
<p id="p-0200" num="0199">In some embodiments, one or more ends of the wire can be coupled to a force sensor which can be used to sense the tissue contacting force of the wire as it is manipulated. For example, the force sensor may detect when a portion of the wire contacts tissue and the wire can be manipulated to either contact tissue or withdraw from tissue contact so the proper energy source and intensity can be delivered to the tissue site. In some instances, delivering RF energy in free can create arcing, and the force sensor can determine when the wire is in contact with tissue to reduce the chance of RF energy causing an arc in free space.</p>
<p id="p-0201" num="0200"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>26</b>A and <b>26</b>B</figref> illustrate an active adjustable loop <b>2200</b> configured to precisely and accurately control the position of the energy source in relation to the tissue surface being treated. The active adjustable loop may be formed as a helical structure. In some embodiments, an adjustable member <b>2202</b>, such as a wire which can be formed from suitable materials such as nitinol or spring steel, may be shape set or bent to a known geometry. A first end <b>2602</b> of the helix may remain fixed in the shaft <b>12</b> of the probe <b>450</b>. A second end <b>2604</b> of the helix may be allowed to translate axially. The second end of the helix may translate in a direction along the elongate axis <b>2610</b> of the probe. When the second end of the helix is translated proximally (in relation to the anatomy), the helix can be caused to increase proportionately in size to a known geometry and diameter (see <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>26</b>B</figref>). As the second end of the helix is translated distally (in relation to the anatomy), the helix can be caused to decrease proportionately in size to a known geometry and diameter (see <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>26</b>A</figref>). In some cases, either the first end, the second end, or both may be rotated to change the geometry of the helix, such as by expanding the helix to a desired diameter. The second end of the helix may be controlled using a motor with an encoder (e.g. linear encoder) in line to determine the position of the loop, such that the diameter and position of the loop is always known using geometric calculations or calibrated assembly methods that are stored in the memory of a processor. A standard surgical snare <b>2620</b> may be provided to capture and retain a tissue structure, which in some cases may be a medial lobe of a prostate.</p>
<p id="p-0202" num="0201">In some embodiments to control the position of the energy source precisely and accurately to the tissue surface, the adjustable member may be attached to a force sensing element or transducer. Force applied to the adjustable member would be measurable and similarly, the force of the adjustable member against tissue may also be measured.</p>
<p id="p-0203" num="0202">In some embodiments, the adjustable member may be electrically conductive. In some cases, RF energy may be passed through the adjustable member and conducted through the tissue via a grounding pad (e.g. monopolar energy). In some embodiments, there may be an insulating material between two portions of the adjustable member at the distal end where energy is applied to the tissue. Both portions of the wire may be electrically isolated from each other, such that RF energy may be passed between both portions of the wire (e.g. bipolar energy).</p>
<p id="p-0204" num="0203">In some embodiments to control the position of the energy source precisely and accurately to the tissue surface, the probe <b>450</b> may include an imaging device, such as an endoscope for imaging and observing the tissue at loop <b>2200</b>.</p>

In some cases, a snare <b>2620</b> extending from the probe may remain fixed in space as the probe translates along the elongate axis <b>1250</b> of the probe. For example, the snare may be manipulated to capture a tissue structure, such as the medial lobe of the prostate, and the snare may then be free to slide within the probe. In other words, once the snare captures the target tissue, the snare may remain stationary while the probe translates axially.</p>

For example, energy may be coupled or delivered through the adjustable member, and a single or multiple electrodes, or electrically conductive members, may be attached to the adjustable member. Electrically conductive wiring may be connected from the electrodes through the probe shaft and connected to an energy generator source. Energy may pass from the generator source through the wiring to the single or multiple electrodes on the adjustable member. In some embodiments, RF energy is used to treat the tissue.
