The dirt collection region may be internal of the cyclone chamber (e.g., the dirt collection region may be a lower end of the cyclone chamber. Alternately, the dirt collection region may be a separate dirt collection chamber that is external to the cyclone chamber and in communication with the cyclone chamber via a dirt outlet. The dirt out may be a slot formed in the sidewall of a cyclone chamber or a gap provided between the end of the cyclone wall and an end of the cyclone chamber.</p>
<heading id="h-0004" level="1">SUMMARY</heading>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">In accordance with one aspect of this disclosure, a cyclone chamber is provided with a dirt collection chamber that is in communication with the cyclone chamber by an axially extending dirt outlet. The dirt outlet may have a length dimension in the axial longitudinal direction of the cyclone chamber that is greater than its width dimension in the circumferential direction of the cyclone chamber. For example, the length of the dirt outlet may be 2, 4, 6, 8 or 10 times or more the width of the dirt outlet (i.e., the width in the direction around the perimeter of the cyclone sidewall in a plane transverse to the cyclone axis), An advantage of this design is that, as the air rotates in the cyclone chamber and dirt is disentrained, the disentrained dirt may be deposited into a dirt collection chamber without the disentrained dirt having to be conveyed along the cyclone sidewall to a dirt outlet at an axial end of the cyclone chamber. Accordingly, the tendency of dirt to be re-entrained in the air rotating in the cyclone chamber may be reduced.</p>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">In accordance with this aspect, there is provided a surface cleaning apparatus comprising an air flow path extending from a dirty air inlet to a clean air outlet with a cyclone and a suction motor positioned in the air flow path, the cyclone comprising:

The two dirt outlet regions may be discrete outlets (i.e., each dirt outlet region may be a dirt outlet that is surrounded by, e.g., a portion of the sidewall of the cyclone chamber or a portion of the sidewall of the cyclone chamber and a portion of an end wall of the cyclone chamber) or they may be contiguous (e.g., they may be connected by a gap or slot formed in the cyclone chamber sidewall so as to form a single dirt outlet opening in, e.g., the cyclone chamber sidewall).</p>
<p id="p-0026" num="0027">An advantage of this design is that dirt which is separated from the air swirling in the cyclone chamber prior to the swirling air reaching an end of the cyclone chamber opposed to the cyclone air inlet end (e.g., after the air has turned, for example, 1 or 2 times in the cyclone chamber) may be removed from the cyclone chamber by a first dirt outlet region and the remainder of the dirt may be separated in a second dirt outlet region that is located closer to or at the end of the cyclone chamber opposed to the cyclone air inlet end.</p>

<heading id="h-0007" level="2">General Description of a Hand Vacuum Cleaner</heading>
<p id="p-0158" num="0168">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>1</b>-<b>2</b></figref>, an exemplary embodiment of a surface cleaning apparatus is shown generally as 100. The following is a general discussion of apparatus <b>100</b>, which provides a basis for understanding several of the features that are discussed herein. As discussed subsequently, each of the features may be used individually or in any particular combination or sub-combination in this or in other embodiments disclosed herein.</p>
<p id="p-0159" num="0169">Embodiments described herein include an improved cyclonic air treatment member <b>116</b>, and a surface cleaning apparatus <b>100</b> including the same. Surface cleaning apparatus <b>100</b> may be any type of surface cleaning apparatus, including for example a hand vacuum cleaner as shown (see also <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>28</b></figref>), a stick vacuum cleaner, an upright vacuum cleaner (<b>100</b> in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>24</b></figref>), a canister vacuum cleaner, an extractor, or a wet/dry type vacuum cleaner.</p>
<p id="p-0160" num="0170">In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>1</b>-<b>2</b> and <b>28</b></figref>, surface cleaning apparatus <b>100</b> is illustrated as a hand vacuum cleaner, which may also be referred to also as a &#x201c;handvac&#x201d; or &#x201c;hand-held vacuum cleaner&#x201d;. As used herein, a hand vacuum cleaner is a vacuum cleaner that can be operated to clean a surface generally one-handedly. That is, the entire weight of the vacuum may be held by the same one hand used to direct a dirty air inlet of the vacuum cleaner with respect to a surface to be cleaned. For example, handle <b>104</b> and dirty air inlet <b>108</b> may be rigidly coupled to each other (directly or indirectly), such as being integrally formed or separately molded and then non-removably secured together (e.g. adhesive or welding), so as to move as one while maintaining a constant orientation relative to each other. This is to be contrasted with canister and upright vacuum cleaners, whose weight is typically supported by a surface (e.g. a floor) during use. When a canister vacuum cleaner is operated, or when an upright vacuum cleaner is operated in a &#x2018;lift-away&#x2019; configuration, a second hand is typically required to direct the dirty air inlet at the end of a flexible hose.</p>
<p id="p-0161" num="0171">Still referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>1</b>-<b>2</b> and <b>28</b></figref>, surface cleaning apparatus <b>100</b> includes a main body or a handvac body <b>112</b> having an air treatment member <b>116</b> (which may be permanently affixed to the main body or may be removable in part or in whole therefrom for emptying), a dirty air inlet <b>108</b>, a clean air outlet <b>120</b>, and an air flow path <b>124</b> extending between the dirty air inlet <b>108</b> and the clean air outlet <b>120</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0162" num="0172">Surface cleaning apparatus <b>100</b> has a front end <b>128</b>, a rear end <b>132</b>, an upper end (also referred to as the top) <b>136</b>, and a lower end (also referred to as the bottom) <b>140</b>. In the embodiment shown, dirty air inlet <b>108</b> is at an upper portion of apparatus front end <b>128</b> and clean air outlet <b>120</b> is at a rearward portion of apparatus <b>100</b> at apparatus rear end <b>132</b>. It will be appreciated that dirty air inlet <b>108</b> and clean air outlet <b>120</b> may be positioned in different locations of apparatus <b>100</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0163" num="0173">A suction motor <b>144</b> is provided to generate vacuum suction through air flow path <b>124</b>, and is positioned within a motor housing <b>148</b>. Suction motor <b>144</b> may be a fan-motor assembly including an electric motor and impeller blade(s). In the illustrated embodiment, suction motor <b>144</b> is positioned in the air flow path <b>124</b> downstream of air treatment member <b>116</b>. In this configuration, suction motor <b>144</b> may be referred to as a &#x201c;clean air motor&#x201d;. Alternatively, suction motor <b>144</b> may be positioned upstream of air treatment member <b>116</b>, and referred to as a &#x201c;dirty air motor&#x201d;.</p>
<p id="p-0164" num="0174">Air treatment member <b>116</b> is configured to remove particles of dirt and other debris from the air flow. In the illustrated example, air treatment member <b>116</b> includes a cyclone assembly (also referred to as a &#x201c;cyclone bin assembly&#x201d;) having a single cyclonic cleaning stage with a single cyclone <b>152</b> and a dirt collection chamber <b>156</b> (also referred to as a &#x201c;dirt collection region&#x201d;, &#x201c;dirt collection bin&#x201d;, &#x201c;dirt bin&#x201d;, or &#x201c;dirt chamber&#x201d;). Cyclone <b>152</b> has a cyclone chamber <b>154</b>. Dirt collection chamber <b>156</b> may be external to the cyclone chamber <b>154</b> (i.e. dirt collection chamber <b>156</b> may have a discrete volume from that of cyclone chamber <b>154</b>). Cyclone <b>152</b> and dirt collection chamber <b>156</b> may be of any configuration suitable for separating dirt from an air stream and collecting the separated dirt respectively, and may be in communication dirt outlet(s) of the cyclone chamber.</p>
<p id="p-0165" num="0175">In alternate embodiments, air treatment member <b>116</b> may include a cyclone assembly having two or more cyclonic cleaning stages arranged in series with each other. Each cyclonic cleaning stage may include one or more cyclones arranged in parallel with each other and one or more dirt collection chambers, of any suitable configuration. The dirt collection chamber(s) may be external to the cyclone chambers of the cyclones. Each cyclone may have its own dirt collection chamber or two or more cyclones fluidically connected in parallel may have a single common dirt collection chamber.</p>
<p id="p-0166" num="0176">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref>, hand vacuum cleaner <b>100</b> may include a pre-motor filter <b>160</b> provided in the air flow path <b>124</b> downstream of air treatment member <b>116</b> and upstream of suction motor <b>144</b>. Pre-motor filter <b>160</b> may be formed from any suitable physical, porous filter media. For example, pre-motor filter <b>160</b> may be one or more of a foam filter, felt filter, HEPA filter, or other physical filter media. In some embodiments, pre-motor filter <b>160</b> may include an electrostatic filter, or the like. As shown, pre-motor filter <b>160</b> may be located in a pre-motor filter housing <b>164</b> that is external to the air treatment member <b>116</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0167" num="0177">In the illustrated embodiments, dirty air inlet <b>108</b> is the inlet end <b>168</b> of an air inlet conduit <b>172</b>. Optionally, inlet end <b>168</b> of air inlet conduit <b>172</b> can be used as a nozzle to directly clean a surface. Alternatively, or in addition to functioning as a nozzle, air inlet conduit <b>172</b> may be connected (e.g. directly connected) to the downstream end of any suitable accessory tool such as a rigid air flow conduit (e.g., an above floor cleaning wand), a crevice tool, a mini brush, and the like. As shown, dirty air inlet <b>108</b> may be positioned forward of air treatment member <b>116</b>, although this need not be the case.</p>
<p id="p-0168" num="0178">In the embodiment of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>2</b> and <b>28</b></figref>, the air treatment member <b>116</b> comprises a cyclone <b>152</b>, the air treatment air inlet is a cyclone air inlet <b>184</b>, and the air treatment member air outlet is a cyclone air outlet <b>188</b>. Accordingly, in operation, after activating suction motor <b>144</b>, dirty air enters apparatus <b>100</b> through dirty air inlet <b>108</b> and is directed along air inlet conduit <b>172</b> to the cyclone air inlet <b>184</b>. As shown, cyclone air inlet <b>184</b> may direct the dirty air flow to enter cyclone chamber <b>154</b> in a tangential direction so as to promote cyclonic action. Dirt particles and other debris may be disentrained (i.e. separated) from the dirty air flow as the dirty air flow travels from cyclone air inlet <b>184</b> to cyclone air outlet <b>188</b>. The disentrained dirt particles and debris may discharge from cyclone chamber <b>154</b> through a dirt outlet <b>190</b> into dirt collection chamber <b>156</b> external to the cyclone chamber <b>154</b>, where the dirt particles and debris may be collected and stored until dirt collection chamber <b>156</b> is emptied.</p>
<p id="p-0169" num="0179">Air exiting cyclone chamber <b>154</b> may pass through an outlet passage <b>192</b> located upstream of cyclone air outlet <b>188</b>. Cyclone chamber outlet passage <b>192</b> may also act as a vortex finder to promote cyclonic flow within cyclone chamber <b>154</b>. In some embodiments, cyclone outlet passage <b>192</b> may include an air permeable portion <b>197</b> (which may be referred to as a screen or shroud <b>197</b>, e.g. a fine mesh screen) in the air flow path <b>124</b> to remove large dirt particles and debris, such as hair, remaining in the exiting air flow. As exemplified in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>50</b></figref>, the cyclone air outlet <b>188</b> may comprise a conduit portion <b>189</b> which is solid (air impermeable) and an axially inward screen or shroud <b>197</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0170" num="0180">From cyclone air outlet <b>188</b>, the air flow may be directed into pre-motor filter housing <b>164</b> at an upstream side <b>196</b> of pre-motor filter <b>160</b>. The air flow may pass through pre-motor filter <b>160</b>, and then exit through pre-motor filter chamber air outlet <b>198</b> into motor housing <b>148</b>. At motor housing <b>148</b>, the clean air flow may be drawn into suction motor <b>144</b> and then discharged from apparatus <b>100</b> through clean air outlet <b>120</b>. Prior to exiting the clean air outlet <b>120</b>, the treated air may pass through a post-motor filter <b>176</b>, which may be one or more layers of filter media.</p>
<p id="p-0171" num="0181">Power may be supplied to suction motor <b>144</b> and other electrical components of apparatus <b>100</b> from an onboard energy storage member, which may include, for example, one or more batteries <b>180</b><i>a </i>or other energy storage device. In the illustrated embodiment, apparatus <b>100</b> includes a battery pack <b>180</b>. Battery pack <b>180</b> may be permanently connected to apparatus <b>100</b> and rechargeable in-situ, or removable from apparatus <b>100</b>. In the example shown, battery pack <b>180</b> is located between handle <b>104</b> and air treatment member <b>116</b>. Alternatively, or in addition to battery pack <b>180</b>, power may be supplied to apparatus <b>100</b> by an electrical cord (not shown) connected to apparatus <b>100</b> that can be electrically connected to mains power by at a standard wall electrical outlet.</p>
<p id="p-0172" num="0000">Cyclonic Air Treatment Member with Two or More Dirt Outlets Extending Angularly Around the Cyclone Chamber Sidewall</p>
<p id="p-0173" num="0182">Embodiments herein relate to an improved cyclonic air treatment member that may have two or more dirt outlets, which extend around a portion of the perimeter of the cyclone chamber sidewall. The features in this section may be used by themselves in any surface cleaning apparatus or in any combination or sub-combination with any other feature or features described herein.</p>
<p id="p-0174" num="0183">Within a cyclone, dirt is disentrained from a dirt laden air flow by directing the air flow along a cyclonic path. The cyclonic flow direction imparts radially outward forces upon dirt particles in the air flow, whereby the dirt particles are separated from the air flow and ultimately, e.g., ride against the cyclone sidewall. Dirt moved against the cyclone sidewall may exit from the cyclone chamber to a dirt collection chamber through a dirt outlet.</p>
<p id="p-0175" num="0184">The ability of a cyclonic flow to separate dirt particles depends in part on the radial acceleration experienced by the dirt particles as a result of their cyclonic velocity through the cyclone. However, the cyclonic particle velocity may slow between the cyclone air inlet and air outlet. Below a threshold cyclonic particle velocity, the separation efficiency (i.e. the percentage of dirt particles separated from the dirty air flow by the cyclone) may be substantially reduced. When a vacuum cleaner operates at a high air flow rate (e.g. a &#x2018;high power mode&#x2019; in a handvac), the cyclonic particle velocity between the cyclone air inlet and air outlet may remain well above such threshold velocity. However, when a vacuum cleaner operates at a low air flow rate (e.g. a &#x2018;low power mode&#x2019; in a handvac), the cyclonic particle velocity may fall below the threshold velocity at some point between the cyclone air inlet and air outlet. In such a case, some of the dirt particles that have already been disentrained may be reintrained.</p>
<p id="p-0176" num="0185">Embodiments herein relate to an improved cyclone having a dirt outlet that comprises a plurality of dirt outlet regions. A first dirt outlet region may be positioned closer, along the cyclonic air flow path, to the cyclone air inlet. The dirt outlet may have at least one additional dirt outlet region that may be positioned closer, along the cyclonic air flow path, to the cyclone air inlet. The additional dirt outlet region may be positioned at a location at which the cyclonic particle velocity may still be high enough (e.g. above the threshold velocity) to provide a targeted separation efficiency, even when operating at a lower air flow rate. Thus, the additional dirt outlet may permit the apparatus to optionally operate at a lower air flow rate with less loss of separation efficiency, all else being equal. For a handvac, this may mitigate the loss of separation efficiency when operating in a &#x2018;low power mode&#x2019;, which otherwise has an advantage of consuming less power thereby providing a longer run-time on a single charge.</p>
<p id="p-0177" num="0186">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>2</b>-<b>4</b></figref>, cyclone <b>152</b> includes a cyclone sidewall <b>202</b> that, as exemplified, extends along a cyclone longitudinal axis <b>204</b> between a cyclone first end <b>206</b> and a cyclone second end <b>208</b>. Accordingly, cyclone chamber <b>154</b> is bounded by cyclone sidewall <b>202</b> and cyclone first and second ends <b>206</b>, <b>208</b>. Cyclone <b>152</b> includes a tangential air inlet <b>184</b>, although any air inlet may be used. As shown, air inlet <b>184</b> may be located proximate cyclone first end <b>206</b>, although the cyclone air inlet may be provided at other locations. Cyclone also includes an air outlet <b>188</b>. Cyclone air outlet <b>188</b> may be located proximate cyclone second end <b>208</b>, such as in the illustrated uniflow cyclone configuration, or it may be located at cyclone first end <b>206</b> (see, for example <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>24</b>-<b>25</b></figref>). Apparatus air flow path <b>124</b> includes a cyclone air flow path <b>212</b>, which extends from cyclone air inlet <b>184</b> to cyclone air outlet <b>188</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0178" num="0187">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>3</b>-<b>4</b></figref>, cyclone <b>152</b> may include first and second dirt outlet regions <b>190</b><sub>1 </sub>and <b>190</b><sub>2</sub>. Second dirt outlet region <b>190</b><sub>2 </sub>may be located proximate (e.g. at or closer to) cyclone second end <b>208</b>. For example, second dirt outlet region <b>190</b><sub>2 </sub>may be located at the cyclone second end <b>208</b> as exemplified in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>2</b> and <b>3</b></figref>. Second dirt outlet region <b>190</b><sub>2 </sub>may be of any design known in the vacuum cleaner arts. For example, it may be a slot formed in the cyclone sidewall at the cyclone second end <b>208</b> as exemplified or it may be defined by a gap between the cyclone chamber sidewall and the second end wall <b>208</b> (e.g., it may be an annular opening at the end of the cyclone sidewall that faces the cyclone second end <b>208</b>. First dirt outlet region <b>190</b><sub>1 </sub>may be located axially or longitudinally towards cyclone first end <b>206</b> relative to second dirt outlet region <b>190</b><sub>2</sub>.</p>
<p id="p-0179" num="0188">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>4</b>-<b>5</b></figref>, first dirt outlet region <b>190</b><sub>1 </sub>may be provided anywhere in cyclone sidewall <b>202</b> having a longitudinal position between cyclone first end <b>206</b> and second dirt outlet <b>190</b><sub>2</sub>. For example, first dirt outlet region <b>190</b><sub>1 </sub>may be longitudinally positioned between cyclone air inlet <b>184</b> and second dirt outlet <b>190</b><sub>2</sub>. This may allow dirt that enters cyclone <b>152</b> to exit through cyclone dirt outlet region <b>190</b><sub>1 </sub>while that dirt has sufficient cyclonic velocity and before that dirt would have reached second dirt outlet region <b>190</b><sub>2</sub>.</p>
<p id="p-0180" num="0189">In some embodiments, first dirt outlet region <b>190</b><sub>1 </sub>may be aligned with a cyclonic portion of cyclone air flow path <b>212</b> (see for example <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>15</b></figref>). This allows separated dirt that is sliding on cyclone sidewall <b>202</b> as it is carried along a cyclonic portion of air flow path <b>212</b> to flow into first dirt outlet region <b>190</b><sub>1</sub>, through which the dirt can exit into dirt collection chamber <b>156</b>. Accordingly, the alignment of first dirt outlet region <b>190</b><sub>1 </sub>may permit the dirt outlet region <b>190</b><sub>1 </sub>to better interact with dirt separated during an upstream portion of the cyclone air flow path <b>212</b>. Even when operating at a low air flow rate, the upstream portion of flow path <b>212</b> may yet have sufficient dirt particle velocity to provide a high separation efficiency.</p>
<p id="p-0181" num="0190">It will be appreciated that cyclone <b>152</b> may have more than first and second dirt outlet regions <b>190</b><sub>1 </sub>and <b>190</b><sub>2</sub>. For example, as exemplified in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>50</b>-<b>52</b></figref>, three dirt outlet regions <b>190</b><sub>1</sub>, <b>190</b><sub>2 </sub>and <b>190</b><sub>3 </sub>may be provided. As exemplified in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>53</b>-<b>54</b>, <b>57</b>-<b>59</b>, <b>60</b>-<b>62</b> and <b>63</b>-<b>65</b></figref> six dirt outlet regions <b>190</b><sub>1</sub>-<b>190</b><sub>6 </sub>may be provided. As exemplified in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>55</b>-<b>56</b></figref>, ten dirt outlet regions <b>190</b><sub>1</sub>-<b>190</b><sub>10 </sub>may be provided. As exemplified, the plurality of dirt outlet regions comprises a plurality of discrete outlet slots that are arranged side by side along a portion of, or all of, an axial length of the cyclone.</p>
<p id="p-0182" num="0191">As exemplified in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>50</b></figref>, the dirt outlet regions <b>190</b> may be positioned only in the portion of the cyclone chamber sidewall that is radially outward of the solid conduit portion <b>189</b> of the air outlet. Alternately, as exemplified in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>53</b></figref>, the dirt outlet regions <b>190</b> may be positioned in the portion of the cyclone chamber sidewall that is radially outward of the solid conduit portion <b>189</b> and the screen/shroud <b>197</b> of the air outlet.</p>
<p id="p-0183" num="0192">If a plurality of dirt outlet regions is provided, they may extend from the rear end of the cyclone <b>152</b> (cyclone second end <b>208</b>) towards the front end (cyclone chamber first end <b>206</b>) as exemplified in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>51</b> and <b>54</b></figref>, or to the front end of the cyclone as exemplified in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>56</b></figref>. If the air inlet is provided internal of the cyclone <b>152</b>, as exemplified in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>55</b></figref>, then the dirt outlet regions <b>190</b> may terminate at or rearward of the downstream wall <b>183</b> of the air inlet conduit <b>129</b>. Accordingly, the portion of the cyclone chamber sidewall extending forwardly of downstream wall <b>183</b> of the air inlet conduit <b>129</b> (section A in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>55</b></figref>) may not have any dirt outlet regions <b>190</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0184" num="0193">Optionally, or in addition, if plurality of dirt outlet regions is provided, they may be evenly axially spaced apart as exemplified in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>51</b>, <b>54</b> and <b>56</b></figref>, or they may be spaced apart by different amounts. If the axial length of a cyclone is about 80 mm, then the axial distance between dirt outlet regions <b>190</b> may be 1-6 mm, 1.5-4 mm or 2-3 mm. It will be appreciated that, if the axial length and/or diameter of a cyclone increases, then the axial distance between dirt outlet regions <b>190</b> may be increased.</p>
<p id="p-0185" num="0194">Still referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>4</b>-<b>5</b></figref>, cyclone air flow path <b>212</b> may have an axial flow width <b>216</b> (i.e. measured parallel to longitudinal axis <b>204</b>) approximately equal to an axial width <b>220</b> (i.e. measured parallel to longitudinal axis <b>204</b>) of cyclone air inlet <b>184</b>. Axial flow width <b>216</b> may remain generally constant between cyclone air inlet <b>184</b> and cyclone second end <b>208</b>. Cyclone dirt outlet regions <b>190</b> may have any axial width <b>224</b> suitable for allowing dirt separated from the air flow to exit cyclone chamber <b>154</b> towards dirt collection chamber <b>156</b>. Preferably, axial dirt outlet width <b>224</b><sub>1 </sub>(or axial width <b>224</b> of each dirt outlet region <b>190</b>) is between 35% and 90% of axial air inlet width <b>220</b> (i.e. about 35% to 90% of axial air flow path width <b>216</b>). A width <b>224</b> within this range may be large enough to permit common dirt particle sizes to exit freely through the cyclone dirt outlet region <b>190</b>, and yet may not be so large that a detrimental amount of the air flow is diverted from cyclone chamber <b>154</b> through cyclone dirt outlet region <b>190</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0186" num="0195">In other embodiments, axial dirt outlet width <b>224</b><sub>1 </sub>may be between 15% and 150% of axial air inlet width <b>220</b> (i.e. about 15% to 150% of axial air flow path width <b>216</b>), between 25% and 125%, between 40% and 75% or between 50% and 60%. The lower portion of this range (e.g., 10% to 50% or 15% to 35% of axial air inlet width <b>220</b>) may minimize the amount of the air flow that diverts through cyclone dirt outlet <b>190</b> while still permitting at least small dirt particles to exit. The upper portion of this range (e.g., 75% to 150%, 90% to 150% or 100% to 125% of axial air inlet width <b>220</b>) may allow very large dirt particles to exit, although a somewhat greater amount of air flow may divert through cyclone dirt outlet region <b>190</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0187" num="0196">Accordingly, if the axial length of a cyclone is about 80 mm, then the axial dirt outlet width <b>240</b> may be 1-18 mm, 2-6 mm, 3-5, or 4 mm. It will be appreciated that, if the axial length and/or diameter of a cyclone increases, then the axial outlet width <b>224</b> may be increased. Expressed differently, the axial dirt outlet width <b>224</b> may be 2-8%, 3-7% or 5% of the axial length of the cyclone.</p>
<p id="p-0188" num="0197">The axial dirt outlet width <b>224</b> and/or axial distance between dirt outlet regions <b>190</b> may decrease from the forward location at which the dirt outlet regions <b>190</b> commence to the rear end of the location where the dirt outlet regions <b>190</b> terminate.</p>
<p id="p-0189" num="0198">A dirt outlet region <b>190</b> may extend around part or all of the cyclone chamber sidewall, optionally in a plane transverse to the cyclone axis of rotation. For example, a dirt outlet region <b>190</b> may extend in an arc that extends 10-180&#xb0;, 25-120&#xb0;, 35-90&#xb0; or 45-75&#xb0; around the cyclone chamber sidewall. Each dirt outlet may have the same arc or a different arc.</p>
<p id="p-0190" num="0199">It will be appreciated that the dirt outlet regions <b>190</b> may have the same size (e.g. width, length, and/or area) or may be differently sized and/or differently shaped. As exemplified in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>3</b>, <b>9</b>-<b>11</b>, <b>51</b>, <b>54</b> and <b>56</b></figref>, the dirt outlet regions are rectangular in shape. Alternately, the dirt outlet regions may have rounded angularly spaced apart ends (see <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>57</b>-<b>59</b></figref>), they may be oblong (see <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>60</b>-<b>62</b></figref>), they may have concave angularly extending walls (see <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>63</b>-<b>65</b></figref>), convex angularly extending walls (see <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>70</b></figref>) or both concave and convex angularly extending walls (see <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>67</b>-<b>69</b></figref>). Alternately, or in addition, as exemplified in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>71</b></figref>, the axial dirt outlet width <b>224</b> of all (or some) of the dirt outlet regions <b>190</b> may be different. As exemplified, the axial dirt outlet width <b>224</b> may decrease (or decrease continually as exemplified) from the forward most dirt outlet region <b>190</b><sub>1 </sub>to the rearward most dirt outlet region <b>1905</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0191" num="0200">Alternatively, or in addition, the alignment of first dirt outlet region <b>190</b><sub>1 </sub>with a cyclonic portion of cyclone air flow path <b>212</b> may be such that at least 50%, 60%, 70%, 80%, 90% or more of the area of first dirt outlet region <b>190</b><sub>1 </sub>is coincident with (e.g., extends continuously along) the cyclone air flow path <b>212</b>. This may expose separated dirt particles to first dirt outlet region <b>190</b><sub>1 </sub>for an extended continuous distance along cyclone air flow path <b>212</b>, whereby the dirt particles may be more likely to exit through first dirt outlet <b>190</b><sub>1</sub>, all else being equal.</p>
<p id="p-0192" num="0201">The alignment of first dirt outlet region <b>190</b><sub>1 </sub>with the cyclone air flow path <b>212</b> may be such that both an upstream end <b>228</b> of dirt outlet region <b>190</b><sub>1 </sub>and a downstream end <b>232</b> of dirt outlet region <b>190</b><sub>1 </sub>are each located along a portion of the cyclone air flow path <b>212</b>. For example, dirt outlet region <b>190</b><sub>1 </sub>may extend contiguously along a part of the cyclone air flow path <b>212</b> from dirt outlet upstream end <b>228</b> to dirt outlet downstream end <b>232</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0193" num="0202">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b></figref>, first dirt outlet region <b>190</b><sub>1 </sub>may have any axial position (i.e. with respect to cyclone longitudinal axis <b>204</b>) between cyclone first end <b>206</b> and second dirt outlet <b>190</b><sub>2</sub>. In some embodiments, first dirt outlet region <b>190</b><sub>1 </sub>is axially offset from cyclone air inlet <b>184</b> by a distance <b>236</b> sufficient to permit at least some dirt particles within the air flow to separate (i.e. move outwardly to the cyclone sidewall <b>202</b>) as a result of the cyclonic character of air flow path <b>212</b>. For example, first dirt outlet region <b>190</b><sub>1 </sub>may be located at least one turn (i.e., a 360&#xb0; segment) of cyclone air flow path <b>212</b> from cyclone air inlet <b>184</b>. In the illustrated example, first dirt outlet region <b>190</b><sub>1 </sub>is located just under 1.5 turns of cyclone air flow path <b>212</b> from cyclone air inlet <b>184</b>. Characterized another way, axial distance <b>236</b> from cyclone air inlet <b>184</b> to dirt outlet upstream end <b>228</b>, measured center-to-center may be at least equal to cyclone air inlet width <b>220</b> (i.e. at least about cyclone air flow width <b>216</b>). More generally, cyclone air inlet <b>184</b> may be spaced (center-to-center) from cyclone first end <b>206</b> by an axial distance <b>240</b> at least equal to cyclone air inlet width <b>220</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0194" num="0203">Cyclone dirt outlet region <b>190</b><sub>1 </sub>may have any angular (i.e. circumferential) position on cyclone sidewall <b>202</b>. In some embodiments, cyclone dirt outlet region <b>190</b><sub>1 </sub>is angular located at a bottom end <b>244</b> of cyclone sidewall <b>202</b> as shown. This location allows gravity to assist with moving separated dirt particles through cyclone dirt outlet <b>190</b><sub>1</sub>. In other embodiments, cyclone dirt outlet region <b>190</b><sub>1 </sub>may be angularly offset from sidewall bottom end <b>244</b>. Although such positions may not benefit from gravity assistance for discharging separated dirt particles, they may advantageously provide greater flexibility to position cyclone dirt outlet region <b>190</b><sub>1 </sub>at a distance <b>252</b> along cyclone air flow path <b>212</b>, at which cyclonic particle velocities and residency time are optimized for separation efficiency (e.g. at the power mode(s) provided by apparatus <b>100</b>). As an example, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>6</b>-<b>7</b></figref> show cyclone dirt outlet region <b>190</b><sub>1 </sub>angularly located between sidewall top and bottom ends <b>248</b>, <b>244</b>. In the example shown, cyclone dirt outlet region <b>190</b><sub>1 </sub>has a path distance <b>252</b> of about one turn (e.g. 360 degrees) from cyclone air inlet <b>184</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0195" num="0204">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b></figref>, cyclone dirt outlets <b>190</b> may have any orientation that is suitable for allowing dirt particles to exit cyclone chamber <b>154</b>. For example, one of cyclone dirt outlets region <b>190</b> (or both as shown) may be oriented such that they have a radial projection <b>256</b> (i.e. onto a plane <b>260</b> that includes cyclone longitudinal axis <b>204</b>) wherein the long direction is oriented transverse (e.g. perpendicular) to cyclone longitudinal axis <b>204</b>. For example, a cyclone dirt outlet region <b>190</b> may have a projected axis <b>264</b> that is transverse (e.g. perpendicular) to longitudinal axis <b>204</b>. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b></figref>, this may permit cyclone dirt outlet(s) region <b>190</b> to be oriented in alignment with cyclone air flow path <b>212</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0196" num="0205"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b></figref> shows an example in which projections <b>256</b> (and projected axes <b>264</b>) are substantially perpendicular to cyclone longitudinal axis <b>204</b>. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>8</b>-<b>9</b></figref> show an example in which projections <b>256</b> (and projected axes <b>264</b>) are not perpendicular.

<p id="p-0197" num="0206"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>8</b></figref> shows dirt outlet regions <b>190</b> having a helical orientation, which may be aligned with the cyclonic air flow path through cyclone chamber <b>154</b>. As shown, each dirt outlet region <b>190</b> has an upstream end <b>228</b> located towards cyclone first end <b>206</b> relative to its downstream end <b>232</b>. An advantage of this design is that it can allow a greater portion of the area of dirt outlet region regions <b>190</b> to extend continuously along a portion of the cyclonic air flow path in cyclone chamber <b>154</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0198" num="0207"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>9</b></figref> shows dirt outlet regions <b>190</b> having a helical orientation, which may be transverse (e.g. opposed to, misaligned, or counter-aligned) with the cyclonic air flow path through cyclone chamber <b>154</b>. For example, if the cyclonic air flow path <b>212</b> from cyclone air inlet <b>184</b> is counterclockwise when viewed from cyclone first end <b>206</b> looking towards cyclone second end <b>208</b> as illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b></figref>, then one or both of dirt outlet regions <b>190</b> may extend clockwise from their outlet upstream end <b>228</b> to their outlet downstream end <b>232</b> as seen in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>9</b></figref> (or vice versa). An advantage of a transversely oriented dirt outlet <b>190</b> is that it may intersect several turns of the cyclone air flow path, which may expose the dirt outlet <b>190</b> to dirt particles having a wider range of residency time and particle velocities in the cyclonic flow. This may allow particles of different sizes sufficient time to separate from the air flow and make contact with cyclone sidewall <b>202</b>. This design may also permit the dirt outlet region <b>190</b> to provide an effective exit for a wider range of air flow rates. Further, where the air flow path within cyclone <b>152</b> reverses direction at cyclone second end <b>208</b> to travel towards cyclone air outlet <b>188</b> (e.g. through cyclone chamber outlet passage <b>192</b>, see <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref>) this design may align the dirt outlet region <b>190</b> with the reversed portion of the air flow path (i.e. the &#x2018;counter-flow&#x2019; portion of the air flow path).</p>

Accordingly, as opposed to, e.g., <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>13</b></figref> wherein two discrete outlet slots are provided, a single outlet slot or opening or gap in the sidewall may be provided which comprises two or more dirt outlet regions. An advantage of this design is that it may provide, where the first and second dirt outlet regions <b>190</b><sub>1 </sub>and <b>190</b><sub>2 </sub>meet, an outlet region having a large outlet width and length, which can accommodate especially large dirt particles. In the illustrated example, the first and second dirt outlet regions <b>190</b><sub>1 </sub>and <b>190</b><sub>2 </sub>have different orientations relative to cyclone longitudinal axis <b>204</b>.

First and second dirt outlet regions <b>190</b><sub>1 </sub>and <b>190</b><sub>2 </sub>may be oriented the same (as shown), or differently from each other.

In the illustrated embodiment, third dirt outlet region <b>190</b><sub>3 </sub>is contiguous with first and second dirt outlets <b>190</b><sub>1 </sub>and <b>190</b><sub>2</sub>.

<p id="p-0206" num="0215">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b></figref>, any or all of dirt outlet regions <b>190</b> may be formed in cyclone sidewall <b>202</b>. For example, a dirt outlet <b>190</b> may include an aperture (e.g. hole or slot) in cyclone sidewall <b>202</b> that allows separated dirt particles to exit cyclone chamber <b>154</b> towards dirt collection chamber <b>156</b>. In the illustrated example, dirt outlet regions <b>190</b> are formed in a portion of cyclone sidewall <b>202</b> that is common to dirt collection chamber <b>156</b>. An advantage of this design is that it provides the shortest travel distance from dirt outlet <b>190</b> to dirt collection chamber <b>156</b>, which may mitigate dirt particles collecting in an intervening passage. However, in alternative embodiments dirt outlet region <b>190</b> may provide an entrance to a passage leading to dirt collection chamber <b>156</b>. This may provide greater flexibility in the location of dirt collection chamber <b>156</b> relative cyclone chamber <b>154</b>, such as to optimize apparatus <b>100</b> for compactness. Embodiments having a dirt outlet passage are discussed below.</p>
<p id="p-0207" num="0216"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b></figref> shows an example in which dirt outlet regions <b>190</b> are formed as slots in cyclone sidewall <b>202</b> (e.g., an open having a long dimension that extends circumferentially around a portion of the sidewall).

As compared to a slot, an array of apertures <b>268</b> may provide many smaller apertures that are discontiguous with each other. This may help to reduce the amount of the air flow which diverts into dirt collection chamber <b>156</b>, which in turn may reduce the backpressure and re-entrainment of collected dirt that can result from such divergence. A dirt outlet region <b>190</b> may be composed of an array of 4 or more (e.g., 5, 6, 7, 8, 9 or 10) closely arranged apertures <b>268</b> organized in any pattern. In the illustrated embodiment, each dirt outlet region <b>190</b> is formed as 4 equally sized apertures <b>268</b> arranged linearly in a single row. In other embodiment, each dirt outlet region <b>190</b> may be formed from more than 4 apertures, which may be the same or differently sized, and which may be arranged in one or many rows (or in a different non-linear pattern).

<p id="p-0208" num="0000">Cyclonic Air Treatment Member with a Plurality of Apertures</p>
<p id="p-0209" num="0217">Embodiments herein relate to an improved cyclonic air treatment member that may have a plurality of small dirt outlets, which may be referred to as &#x201c;apertures&#x201d; or &#x201c;perforations&#x201d;. The features in this section may be used by themselves in any surface cleaning apparatus or in any combination or sub-combination with any other feature or features described herein. For example, a cyclone may have a plurality of apertures as well as one or more slots as described herein. If a combination of a slot and apertures are used, the apertures may be provided in one or more group of apertures, and one or more groups of apertures may be provided at or proximate a location of the slot or spaced therefrom. If a combination of slots and apertures are used, the apertures may be provided in one or more group of apertures, and one or more groups of apertures may be provided at or proximate a location of each slot or spaced therefrom. For example, a group of apertures may be positioned between a pair of spaced apart slots. Alternately, a cyclone may have only a plurality of apertures as the dirt outlet.</p>
<p id="p-0210" num="0218">As exemplified in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>21</b>-<b>22</b></figref>, in some embodiments cyclone <b>152</b> includes one or more groups <b>272</b> of small apertures <b>274</b> (e.g. 10 or more apertures <b>274</b>) adjacent one or more (or all) of dirt outlet regions <b>190</b>. For example, a group <b>272</b> may be located towards cyclone first end <b>206</b> relative to the adjacent dirt outlet region <b>190</b> (e.g. upstream of the adjacent dirt outlet region <b>190</b>). Aperture group <b>272</b> may provide an exit for small dirt particles which remain open in the event that the adjacent dirt outlet region <b>190</b> becomes clogged. As shown, each group <b>272</b> may be angularly aligned (e.g. circumferentially aligned) with its respective adjacent dirt outlet region <b>190</b>. The illustrated embodiment shows a first group <b>272</b><sub>1 </sub>of apertures adjacent dirt outlet region <b>190</b><sub>1 </sub>and located between first dirt outlet region <b>190</b><sub>1 </sub>and cyclone first end <b>206</b>, and a second group <b>272</b><sub>2 </sub>of apertures adjacent dirt outlet region <b>190</b><sub>2 </sub>and located between second dirt outlet <b>190</b><sub>2 </sub>and first dirt outlet <b>190</b><sub>1</sub>.

<p id="p-0211" num="0219">Returning to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>21</b></figref>, each aperture <b>274</b> may have a size (e.g. width, length, and/or area) that is substantially smaller than the associated adjacent dirt outlet region <b>190</b>. In some embodiments, aperture <b>274</b> may have a width <b>288</b> of between 0.10 inches to 0.20 inches. This may provide a size that accommodates most small dirt particles collected in domestic (e.g. residential and commercial) environments. More generally, apertures <b>274</b> may each have a width <b>288</b> of between 0.010 inches and 0.500 inches. Apertures <b>274</b> having a width <b>288</b> of between 0.010 inches and 0.10 inches may provide exits suitable for very fine particles, and may minimize the amount of the air flow that diverts from the cyclone chamber <b>154</b> through apertures <b>274</b>. Apertures <b>274</b> having a width <b>288</b> of between 0.20 inches and 0.50 inches may provide exits suitable for relatively larger particles, although somewhat more of the air flow may divert from cyclone chamber <b>154</b> through apertures <b>274</b>. This may provide an acceptable trade-off where the dirt particles targeted for collection by apparatus <b>100</b> tend to be larger.</p>
<p id="p-0212" num="0220">As exemplified in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>72</b>-<b>79</b></figref>, in some embodiments, the cyclone chamber <b>154</b> may include dirt outlet that is a group of small apertures <b>272</b>.

For example, the group of apertures <b>272</b> may have 10, 20, 30, or more apertures <b>274</b>. As exemplified, the group of small apertures <b>272</b> may be in communication with the dirt collection chamber <b>156</b> such that a separate dirt outlet region <b>190</b> is not needed to transfer dirt from the cyclone chamber <b>154</b> to the dirt collection chamber <b>156</b>. It will be appreciated that by using only apertures as the dirt outlet, larger dirt particles and elongate material (e.g., hair) will be retained in the cyclone chamber <b>154</b>. Accordingly, cyclone chamber <b>154</b> may function as a dirt collection chamber provided that screen <b>197</b> has openings therein which inhibit dirt remaining in cyclone chamber <b>154</b> from exiting via the cyclone air outlet.</p>
<p id="p-0213" num="0221">As described previously, it will be appreciated that the group of apertures <b>272</b> may be positioned anywhere within the cyclone chamber <b>154</b>.

The first stage cyclone <b>152</b><sub>1 </sub>may be in communication with the second stage cyclone <b>152</b><sub>2 </sub>such that air exits the first stage cyclone <b>152</b><sub>1 </sub>and enters the second stage cyclone chamber <b>154</b><sub>2 </sub>of the second stage cyclone <b>152</b><sub>2</sub>.</p>
<p id="p-0216" num="0224">As described previously, the surface cleaning apparatus <b>100</b> may have a dirt collection chamber <b>156</b>. In some embodiments, the dirt collection chamber <b>156</b> may collect dirt from one or more cyclones of a single cyclonic stage or different cyclonic stages. For example a dirt chamber <b>156</b> may collect dirt from the first stage cyclone <b>152</b><sub>1 </sub>and the second stage cyclone <b>152</b><sub>2</sub>. Alternately, each cyclonic stage may have one or more dirt collection chambers. For example, as exemplified in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>72</b>-<b>79</b></figref>, a surface cleaning apparatus may have two or more cyclonic stages, each of which comprises one or more cyclones and one or more dirt collection chambers <b>156</b>. As exemplified, the first stage cyclone <b>152</b><sub>1 </sub>is in communication with a first dirt collection chamber <b>156</b><sub>1 </sub>and the second stage cyclone <b>152</b><sub>2 </sub>is in communication with a second dirt collection chamber <b>156</b><sub>2</sub>. As exemplified. the dirt collection chambers <b>156</b><sub>1 </sub>and <b>156</b><sub>2 </sub>are external to the cyclone chambers.</p>
<p id="p-0217" num="0225">It will be appreciated that all or a portion of each of the first dirt collection chamber <b>156</b><sub>1 </sub>and the second dirt collection chamber <b>156</b><sub>2 </sub>may underlie a cyclone chamber. As exemplified in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>72</b>-<b>79</b></figref>, all or a portion of each of the first dirt collection chamber <b>156</b><sub>1 </sub>and the second dirt collection chamber <b>156</b><sub>2 </sub>may underlie cyclone chamber <b>154</b>. Accordingly, for example, the cyclone chamber <b>154</b> may have a first lateral side <b>320</b> that extends radially outwardly from centrally positioned cyclone longitudinal axis <b>204</b> in a first direction (e.g., the right side when viewed from the front as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>75</b></figref>) and a second lateral side <b>322</b> that extends radially outwardly from the cyclone longitudinal axis <b>204</b> in a second direction opposed to the first direction (e.g., the left side when viewed from the front as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>75</b></figref>).</p>
<p id="p-0218" num="0226">As exemplified, the first dirt collection chamber <b>156</b><sub>1 </sub>may be positioned on the first lateral side <b>320</b>, while the second dirt collection chamber <b>156</b><sub>2 </sub>may be positioned on the second lateral side <b>322</b>. The two chambers <b>156</b><sub>1</sub>, <b>156</b><sub>2 </sub>may be separated by a partition <b>324</b>. The partition <b>324</b> may also be used to separate the first lateral side <b>320</b> from the second lateral side <b>322</b>. As exemplified in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>72</b>-<b>29</b></figref>, all of the first dirt collection chamber <b>156</b><sub>1 </sub>underlies the first cyclone chamber <b>154</b><sub>1 </sub>and the forward portion of the second dirt collection chamber <b>156</b><sub>2 </sub>(which comprises a majority of the volume of the second dirt collection chamber) may underlie the first cyclone chamber <b>1541</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0219" num="0227">It will be appreciated that the apertures <b>272</b> may be positioned on the first lateral side <b>320</b>, the second lateral side <b>322</b>, or both, depending upon the dirt collection chamber with which they communicate. In the embodiment exemplified in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>75</b></figref>, the first stage cyclone <b>152</b><sub>1 </sub>is located on the first lateral side <b>320</b> and the apertures <b>272</b> are located only on the first lateral side <b>320</b>, as exemplified in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>72</b>-<b>79</b></figref> and more clearly shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>76</b></figref>. Positioning the apertures <b>272</b> only on the first lateral side <b>320</b> enables the apertures to only communicate with the first stage cyclone <b>152</b><sub>1</sub>. Accordingly, it will be appreciated that the apertures of the first stage cyclone chamber may be provided at any location which enables the apertures to communicate only with the first stage cyclone <b>152</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0220" num="0228">As described above, the group of apertures <b>272</b> in the first cyclone chamber <b>154</b><sub>1 </sub>may be positioned on the first lateral side <b>320</b>. Accordingly, when the surface cleaning apparatus <b>100</b> is in operation, dirt separated in the first cyclone <b>152</b><sub>1 </sub>and of a size to pass through the apertures <b>274</b> may exit the first cyclone chamber <b>1541</b> through the apertures <b>274</b> and may enter the first dirt chamber <b>156</b><sub>1</sub>. Dirty air may pass downstream from the first stage cyclone <b>152</b><sub>1 </sub>into the second stage cyclone <b>152</b><sub>2</sub>. The second stage cyclone <b>152</b><sub>2 </sub>may separate dirt from the air, depositing dirt in the second dirt collection chamber <b>156</b><sub>2</sub>, which is located on the second lateral side <b>322</b>. As exemplified, the surface cleaning apparatus is a hand vacuum cleaner which, in use, may be angled with the dirty air inlet <b>108</b> angled downwardly. Therefore, in use, dirt will tend to travel to a forward portion of each of the dirt collection chambers <b>156</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0221" num="0229">Dirt that is larger than apertures <b>274</b> and smaller than the openings of the cyclone air outlet will remain in the first cyclone chamber <b>1541</b>, and, accordingly, first cyclone chamber <b>1541</b> is used as a dirt collection chamber. As exemplified in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>72</b>-<b>79</b></figref>, the surface cleaning apparatus <b>100</b> is a hand vacuum cleaner. Using the first stage cyclone chamber <b>1541</b> as a dirt collection chamber may allow for the reduction in size of the hand vacuum cleaner <b>100</b> while maintaining the storage capacity.</p>
<p id="p-0222" num="0230">Optionally, the dirt collection chambers <b>156</b><sub>1 </sub>and <b>156</b><sub>2 </sub>are concurrently emptyable, optionally concurrent with emptying the first stage cyclone chamber <b>154</b>. Accordingly, each of the dirt collection chambers <b>156</b><sub>1 </sub>and <b>156</b><sub>2 </sub>may have an openable end that are opened concurrently. Alternately, or in addition, the first stage cyclone chamber <b>154</b> may have a portion that opens by itself or concurrently with one or both of the dirt collection chambers <b>156</b><sub>1 </sub>and <b>156</b><sub>2</sub>.</p>
<p id="p-0223" num="0231">As exemplified in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>72</b> and <b>73</b></figref>, the first cyclone <b>152</b><sub>1 </sub>has an openable front. As exemplified, the first cyclone <b>152</b><sub>1 </sub>has a stationary portion <b>330</b> and an openable portion <b>332</b> and the openable portion <b>332</b> is moveably mounted by a mount <b>334</b>. As exemplified, the openable portion <b>332</b> may be a part of the lower end of the surface cleaning apparatus <b>100</b>. For example, the mount <b>334</b> may be a hinge and/or pivot. The openable portion <b>332</b> may be movable between a closed position (see for example <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>76</b>-<b>79</b></figref>), in which the first cyclone chamber <b>154</b><sub>1 </sub>and the first dirt collection chamber <b>156</b><sub>1 </sub>are closed, and an open position, in which the first cyclone chamber <b>154</b><sub>1 </sub>and the first dirt collection chamber <b>156</b><sub>1 </sub>are open (see for example <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>72</b> and <b>73</b></figref>).</p>
<p id="p-0224" num="0232">Optionally, as exemplified, the openable portion <b>332</b> includes a portion of the cyclone sidewall <b>202</b> (e.g., the sidewall may be part of each of the openable and stationary portions).</p>
<p id="p-0225" num="0233">Each of the dirt collection chambers has a port <b>158</b>, which as exemplified may be at the front end of the openable portion (e.g., they may be provided in a front face <b>336</b> thereof).

In this orientation the contents of the first dirt collection chamber <b>156</b><sub>1</sub>, and the second dirt collection chamber <b>156</b><sub>2 </sub>may concurrently be emptied, such as under the influence of gravity.

<p id="p-0226" num="0000">Cyclonic Air Treatment Member with One or More Dirt Outlets Extending Axially on the Cyclone Chamber Sidewall</p>
<p id="p-0227" num="0234">Embodiments herein relate to an improved cyclonic air treatment member that may have one or more dirt outlets which extend in a generally axial direction along at least a portion of the cyclone chamber sidewall. The features in this section may be used by themselves in any surface cleaning apparatus or in any combination or sub-combination with any other feature or features described herein.</p>
<p id="p-0228" num="0235">As discussed previously, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>14</b>-<b>19</b></figref> exemplify embodiments wherein a portion of the dirt outlet extends axially or generally axially. In accordance with the feature discussed in this section, and as exemplified in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>28</b>-<b>34</b></figref>, a cyclone <b>152</b> may have one or more dirt outlets <b>190</b>, each of which extends axially or generally axially. Accordingly, the dirt outlet may not include a portion that extends angularly around the cyclone chamber sidewall as discussed previously.</p>
<p id="p-0229" num="0236">As exemplified in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>29</b> and <b>30</b></figref>, dirt outlet <b>190</b> may have a length <b>224</b> that extends linearly in the axial direction generally parallel to the cyclone axis <b>204</b>. Alternately, similar to outlet <b>190</b><sub>1 </sub>of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>15</b> and <b>16</b></figref> and outlet <b>190</b><sub>3 </sub>of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>18</b>, <b>19</b></figref> the dirt outlet <b>190</b> may extend in a direction that is offset or slightly offset from the direction of the longitudinal axis <b>204</b>, e.g. by &#xb1;about 20&#xb0; or &#xb1;10&#xb0;. The dirt outlet <b>190</b> may extend linearly as exemplified in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>29</b> and <b>30</b></figref> or angularly as similar to outlet <b>190</b><sub>1 </sub>of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>15</b> and <b>16</b></figref> and outlet <b>190</b><sub>3 </sub>of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>18</b>, <b>19</b></figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0230" num="0237">The dirt outlet <b>190</b> has a transverse width <b>226</b> that extends in a circumferential direction of the cyclone chamber <b>154</b>. As shown in the example of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>32</b></figref>, the length <b>224</b> is greater than the width <b>226</b> (e.g., the length <b>224</b> may be 5, 10, 15 or 20 times the width <b>226</b>). As the air rotates within a cyclone chamber, the air will tend to stay in a band. The band may have an axial length about the axial length of a tangential air inlet. Accordingly, the dirt outlet <b>190</b> may have an axial length that is at least as long as the axial length of a tangential cyclone inlet, which may allow the dirt outlet <b>190</b> to underlie the axial length of an entire band of air in a turn of the cyclonic air flow path through cyclone chamber <b>154</b>. If the axial length of the dirt outlet is longer, then the dirt outlet <b>190</b> may underlie more than one turn of the air, e.g., it may underlie 1.5 or 2 turns of the air.</p>
<p id="p-0231" num="0238">In some embodiments, as exemplified in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>28</b>-<b>34</b></figref>, the cyclone dirt outlet may be formed as an opening or gap in the cyclone chamber sidewall <b>202</b>. In the illustrated embodiment, dirt outlet <b>190</b> is formed as a rectangular aperture in the sidewall <b>202</b>. In alternative embodiments, dirt outlet <b>190</b> may have other shapes (e.g. elliptical, triangular, irregular shapes) in which the length <b>224</b> is greater than the width <b>226</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0232" num="0239">In some embodiments, the dirt outlet <b>190</b> is provided at a bottom end <b>244</b> of cyclone sidewall <b>202</b> as shown. This may help dirt which remains in the cyclone chamber <b>154</b> after termination of operation of the vacuum cleaner <b>100</b> to fall into the dirt collection chamber <b>156</b> when the vacuum cleaner <b>100</b> is held with the cyclone <b>152</b> extending horizontally (and possibly slightly upwardly).</p>
<p id="p-0233" num="0240">The dirt outlet extends between dirt outlet first or upstream end <b>193</b> and dirt outlet second or downstream end <b>194</b>. The dirt outlet upstream end <b>193</b> may be located at any location along the axial length of the cyclone <b>152</b>. For example, as exemplified in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>31</b></figref>, the dirt outlet upstream end <b>193</b> may be located at the front end of the cyclone <b>152</b> (cyclone first end <b>206</b>). Alternately, as exemplified in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>47</b></figref>, the dirt outlet upstream end <b>193</b> may be located axially inwardly from the front end of the cyclone <b>152</b>. For example, the dirt outlet upstream end <b>193</b> may be located at or axially inwardly (rearwardly) from the axially inner extent of the cyclone air inlet (see, e.g., <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>46</b></figref>). As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>28</b>-<b>34</b></figref>, the cyclone air inlet <b>184</b> includes a conduit <b>129</b> that extends into, and is located interior to the cyclone chamber <b>154</b>. The open portion of the dirt outlet <b>190</b> may extend from a position located at or, e.g., about 0.01-0.2 inches axially inward from the axially inner side <b>185</b> of the air inlet conduit <b>129</b> towards the cyclone second end <b>208</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0234" num="0241">Similarly, the dirt outlet downstream end <b>194</b> may be located at any location along the axial length of the cyclone <b>152</b>. For example, the dirt outlet downstream end <b>194</b> may be located at the rear end of the cyclone <b>152</b> (cyclone second end <b>208</b>). Alternately, as exemplified in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>30</b></figref>, the dirt outlet downstream end <b>194</b> may be located axially inwardly from the rear end of the cyclone <b>152</b>. For example, the dirt outlet downstream end <b>194</b> may be located at passage second end <b>276</b> or axially inwardly (forwardly) from the axially inner extent of the solid portion of the outlet passage <b>192</b> (see, e.g., <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>30</b></figref>).</p>
<p id="p-0235" num="0242">Accordingly, the dirt outlet <b>190</b> may be provided by an axially extending slot <b>191</b>, which is formed in the sidewall <b>202</b>, which extends longitudinally along at least a portion of the cyclone chamber <b>154</b> in a direction generally parallel to the cyclone axis <b>204</b> between dirt outlet upstream end <b>193</b> and dirt outlet downstream end <b>194</b>. As exemplified in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>29</b>-<b>31</b></figref>, the length <b>225</b> of slot <b>191</b> may be greater than the open length <b>224</b> of the dirt outlet <b>190</b>. This may occur if, for example, the slot extends forwardly of the cyclone air inlet. In such a case, an insert member <b>230</b> may be provided to limit the forward extent of the slot <b>191</b> when the surface cleaning apparatus is in operation (i.e., the length of the slot <b>191</b> may be reduced due to insert member <b>230</b> to provide a dirt outlet upstream end <b>193</b> that is positioned at a selected forward extent of the cyclone <b>152</b>).</p>
<p id="p-0236" num="0243"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>29</b>-<b>31</b></figref> exemplify an embodiment wherein the slot <b>191</b> extends from a position at the cyclone first end <b>206</b> rearward towards the cyclone second end <b>208</b>. In this embodiment, the second end <b>194</b> of the slot <b>191</b> is axially spaced apart from the first end <b>193</b> and is located inwardly (forwardly) of the cyclone second end <b>208</b>. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>30</b></figref>, the slot <b>191</b> is positioned under cyclone air inlet <b>184</b>. Accordingly, air entering the cyclone <b>152</b> at the axial location of the cyclone air inlet <b>184</b> (i.e., between the forward and rearward extent of) could enter the slot <b>191</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0237" num="0244">Optionally, as exemplified, an insert member <b>230</b> may be provided, and may be removably received in a slot portion <b>231</b> of the slot <b>191</b> proximate the cyclone first end <b>206</b> as shown. When the insert member <b>230</b> is received in the slot <b>191</b>, the insert member <b>230</b> can occupy the slot portion <b>231</b> and prevent dirt from exiting the cyclone chamber <b>154</b> via slot portion <b>231</b>. The open portion of the dirt outlet <b>190</b> may thus extend between the second end <b>194</b> and an open outlet end <b>195</b>. As a result, in operation the open length <b>224</b> of the dirt outlet <b>190</b> may be less than the overall length <b>225</b> of the slot <b>191</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0238" num="0245">The insert member may extend from the front end <b>206</b> of the cyclone rearwardly any desired amount. As exemplified in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>29</b>-<b>31</b></figref>, the open outlet end <b>195</b> may be positioned proximate an axially inner side <b>185</b> of the tangential air inlet <b>184</b>. Accordingly, the insert member may extend inwardly to a position at the location of the axially inner side <b>185</b> and, optionally, rearwardly thereof (see for example <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>35</b></figref>).</p>
<p id="p-0239" num="0246">As exemplified in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref>, in some embodiments, first end <b>280</b> of passage <b>192</b> may be solid (i.e., it may not be porous). In such a case, the insert member <b>230</b> may extend to the inner end of the solid portion of screen <b>197</b>, and, optionally, rearwardly thereof such that the open outlet end <b>195</b> may be spaced axially inwardly (towards cyclone second end <b>208</b>) from the axially inner side <b>185</b>. Alternately, if the solid portion of screen <b>197</b> extends to the front end <b>206</b> of the cyclone, then an insert member <b>230</b> may not be provided.</p>
<p id="p-0240" num="0247">Alternately, the passage first end <b>280</b> may be positioned longitudinally adjacent to the inner side <b>185</b> of the air inlet <b>184</b>. If the cyclone air inlet <b>184</b> is provided inside the cyclone chamber <b>154</b>, then the cyclone outlet passage <b>192</b> may extend to a position longitudinally adjacent (e.g., within 0.01, 0.05, 0.1 or 0.125 inches) to the end <b>185</b> of the tangential inlet <b>184</b> closest to the outlet end of the cyclone chamber <b>154</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0241" num="0248">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>30</b></figref>, the passage first end <b>280</b> can be axially spaced inwardly from the inner side <b>185</b> of air inlet conduit <b>129</b>. For example, the first end <b>280</b> of the cyclone outlet passage <b>192</b> may terminate at about 0.01-0.75 or about 0.05-0.375 inches inwardly from the inner side <b>185</b> of the air inlet <b>184</b> in some embodiments. Alternately, in some embodiments, the first end <b>280</b> of the cyclone outlet passage <b>192</b> may abut the downstream wall <b>183</b> of the air inlet conduit <b>129</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0242" num="0249">As discussed subsequently, in some embodiments, the cyclone outlet passage <b>192</b> may be tapered between the passage second end <b>276</b> and the passage first end <b>280</b>. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>30</b></figref>, the transverse width of the cyclone outlet passage <b>192</b> may increase gradually between passage first end <b>280</b> and passage second end <b>276</b>. This may provide a greater radial distance between the cyclone chamber sidewall <b>202</b> and the cyclone outlet passage <b>192</b> at the air inlet end of the cyclone chamber <b>154</b> thereby inhibiting dirt from contacting the screen <b>197</b> as it enters the cyclone chamber <b>154</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0243" num="0250">In some embodiments, the cyclone first end <b>206</b> may be openable. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>31</b></figref>, the cyclone first end <b>206</b> may be defined by an openable front wall <b>207</b>. The front wall <b>207</b> may be movable between a closed position (shown for example in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>28</b>-<b>30</b></figref>) and an open position (shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>31</b></figref>). As illustrated, when the front end <b>206</b> is moved to the open position, the cyclone chamber <b>154</b> and the dirt collection chamber <b>156</b> are each opened. This may facilitate emptying dirt and debris from the cyclone <b>152</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0244" num="0251">Alternately or in addition, the cyclone chamber <b>154</b> and dirt collection chamber <b>156</b> may be separately openable.</p>
<p id="p-0245" num="0252">As exemplified in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>31</b></figref>, if an insert member <b>230</b> is provided, then the insert member <b>230</b> can be mounted to the front wall <b>207</b>. Accordingly, as the cyclone front end <b>206</b> is moved to the open position, the insert member can be removed from the dirt outlet portion <b>231</b>. This may provide additional access to dirt collection chamber <b>156</b> to facilitate emptying.</p>
<p id="p-0246" num="0253">As shown, the cyclone outlet passage <b>192</b> can be tapered. The reduction in width of the passage <b>192</b> moving from the second end <b>176</b> to the first end <b>280</b> may allow the insert member <b>230</b> to have a greater axial length while still permitting the insert member <b>230</b> to be withdrawn from the dirt outlet slot <b>191</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0247" num="0254">It will be appreciated that, instead of providing an insert member <b>230</b> to close part of slot <b>191</b>, slot <b>191</b> may have the same dimensions as dirt outlet <b>190</b>. Such an embodiment is exemplified in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>45</b>-<b>47</b></figref>, wherein the cyclone <b>152</b> is not provided with an insert member <b>230</b>. Rather, as exemplified, the dirt outlet <b>190</b> may be defined entirely by a gap/slot <b>191</b> in the cyclone chamber sidewall <b>202</b>. The cyclone chamber sidewall <b>202</b> may include a section <b>203</b> that extends from proximate the front end <b>206</b> to the dirt outlet first end <b>193</b>. A gap <b>191</b> in the sidewall <b>202</b> extending rearward from the dirt outlet first end <b>193</b> (the open outlet end <b>195</b>) may then define the dirt outlet <b>190</b>. Accordingly, the dirt outlet first end <b>193</b> can be positioned at the same location as discussed with respect to the open outlet end <b>195</b>, i.e., it may be positioned proximate to the second end <b>185</b> of the tangential air inlet <b>184</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0248" num="0255"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>35</b>-<b>38</b></figref> exemplify an embodiment wherein the open portion of the dirt outlet <b>190</b> is axially spaced apart (inwardly) from the second end <b>185</b> of the air inlet <b>184</b> towards the cyclone second end <b>208</b>. This may also reduce the re-entrainment of collected dirt from the dirt collection chamber <b>156</b>, particularly if outlet passage <b>192</b> is not tapered.</p>
<p id="p-0249" num="0256">In the example shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>35</b>-<b>38</b></figref>, the insert member <b>230</b> extends axially from the cyclone first end <b>206</b> towards the cyclone second end <b>208</b> for a distance beyond the inner side <b>185</b> of the air inlet conduit <b>129</b>. As a result, the open outlet end <b>195</b> is axially spaced apart from the inner side <b>185</b> of the air inlet conduit <b>129</b>. In operation, the open length <b>224</b> of the dirt outlet <b>190</b> is thus much less than the overall length <b>225</b> of the slot <b>191</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0250" num="0257">Depending upon the length of the insert member <b>20</b>, the diameter of the cyclone chamber <b>154</b> and the diameter of the passage <b>192</b>, the top side <b>233</b> of the insert member <b>230</b> may contact the cyclone outlet passage <b>192</b> and may brush against the screen <b>197</b> when the insert member <b>230</b> is removed from the cyclone chamber when the cyclone front end <b>206</b> is moved to the open position (see for example <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>37</b>-<b>38</b></figref>). In such an embodiment, the insert member <b>230</b> may thus help dislodge dirt and debris from the screen <b>197</b> to facilitate cleaning thereof. To facilitate the removal of the insert member <b>230</b> in such an embodiment, the insert member may be flexible or bendable (e.g., it may be made of a resilient material) and/or the outlet passage <b>192</b> may be tapered and or shorter.</p>
<p id="p-0251" num="0258">As exemplified, if the insert member <b>230</b> extends past the cyclone inlet, then the cyclone outlet passage <b>192</b> can be tapered. The reduction in width of the passage <b>192</b> moving from the second end <b>176</b> to the first end <b>280</b> may allow the insert member <b>230</b> to be more easily withdrawn from the dirt outlet slot <b>191</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0252" num="0259">Optionally, the insert <b>230</b> may be flexible or bendable. As the front end <b>206</b> is opened, the insert member <b>230</b> may contact the cyclone outlet passage <b>192</b> and press on the screen <b>197</b>. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>37</b>-<b>38</b></figref>, insert member <b>230</b> can flex in response to pressing against the outlet passage <b>192</b> to allow the insert member <b>230</b> to be removed without damaging or displacing the outlet passage <b>192</b>, while still assisting in cleaning the screen <b>197</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0253" num="0260">In the example shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>35</b>-<b>38</b></figref>, the insert member <b>230</b> has a generally triangular shape. The triangular shape of the insert member <b>230</b> may support the insert member <b>230</b> and prevent flexing or bending in response to air flow in the cyclone chamber <b>154</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0254" num="0261">Alternately, other shapes of insert member <b>230</b> may be used. Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>39</b>-<b>41</b></figref>, shown therein is another example of a cyclone <b>152</b> with a rectangular insert member <b>230</b>. The rectangular insert member <b>230</b> shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>39</b>-<b>41</b></figref> may occupy less space allowing for increased capacity in the dirt collection chamber <b>156</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0255" num="0262">As exemplified in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>42</b>-<b>44</b></figref>, in some embodiments the cyclone air inlet <b>184</b> may terminate at a cyclone inlet port <b>187</b> formed in the sidewall <b>202</b> of the cyclone chamber <b>154</b>. In the example illustrated, the cyclone inlet port <b>187</b> is the terminal end of a tangential inlet and is an opening formed in the longitudinally extending sidewall <b>202</b>. The cyclone air inlet <b>184</b> extends from a cyclone air inlet upstream end <b>310</b> to a cyclone air inlet downstream end <b>312</b>. The cyclone air inlet downstream end <b>312</b> may be oriented to direct air substantially tangentially to the inner surface of sidewall <b>202</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0256" num="0263">In the illustrated example of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>42</b>-<b>44</b></figref>, cyclone air inlet <b>184</b> is formed as a curved passage <b>315</b> extending from a cyclone air inlet upstream end <b>310</b> to a cyclone air inlet downstream end <b>312</b>. The curved passage <b>315</b> may provide a gradual change of direction for the air passing through the cyclone air inlet <b>184</b>, which may reduce backpressure through the cyclone air inlet <b>184</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0257" num="0264">The cyclone air inlet <b>184</b> has an inlet width that extends between a first inlet side <b>179</b> and a second inlet side <b>185</b>. In the example illustrated, the first inlet side <b>179</b> and second inlet side <b>185</b> are spaced apart in a longitudinal axial direction generally parallel to the cyclone axis of rotation <b>204</b>. The second inlet side <b>185</b>, or downstream inlet side, is positioned closer to the cyclone second end <b>208</b> than the first inlet side <b>179</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0258" num="0265">As exemplified, where the cyclone air inlet <b>184</b> terminates at a port <b>187</b> in the cyclone chamber sidewall <b>202</b> such as exemplified in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>42</b>-<b>44</b></figref>, the first end <b>208</b> of the passage <b>192</b> may be located at the second inlet side <b>185</b> or, alternately, it may be located axially inwardly of the second side <b>185</b> of the tangential air inlet <b>184</b> (i.e., towards cyclone second end <b>208</b>), for example, 0.01, 0.05, 0.1 or 0.125 inches inwardly of second inlet side <b>185</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0259" num="0266">In alternate embodiments, the first end <b>208</b> of the cyclone outlet passage <b>192</b> may extend to a position at or adjacent (e.g., within 0.01, 0.05, 0.1 or 0.125 inches) of the first end <b>206</b> of the cyclone chamber <b>154</b>. For example, the passage first end <b>280</b> may terminate at about 0.01-0.75 inches or about 0.05-0.375 inches from the cyclone first end <b>206</b> in some embodiments. In such a case, the portion of cyclone outlet passage that is axially co-extensive with port <b>187</b> may be solid.</p>
<p id="p-0260" num="0267">As exemplified in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>48</b>-<b>49</b></figref>, in some embodiments the cyclone <b>152</b> may include a plurality of axially extending dirt outlet <b>190</b><sub>1</sub>, <b>190</b><sub>2</sub>, and <b>190</b><sub>3</sub>. This may allow the dirt outlets to intersect the air flow path through the cyclone chamber <b>154</b> at different locations, which may expose the dirt outlets <b>190</b><sub>1</sub>, <b>190</b><sub>2</sub>, and <b>190</b><sub>3 </sub>to dirt particles having a wider range of residency time and particle velocities in the cyclonic flow.</p>
<p id="p-0261" num="0268">Each of dirt outlets <b>190</b><sub>1</sub>, <b>190</b><sub>2</sub>, and <b>190</b><sub>3 </sub>may be the same or different. Each dirt outlet <b>190</b><sub>1</sub>, <b>190</b><sub>2</sub>, and <b>190</b><sub>3 </sub>may be of any design discussed herein.</p>
<p id="p-0262" num="0269">In the example illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>48</b> and <b>49</b></figref>, the cyclone <b>152</b> omits and insert member <b>230</b> and a section <b>203</b> of the cyclone chamber sidewall <b>202</b> extends to the dirt outlets <b>190</b><sub>1</sub>, <b>190</b><sub>2</sub>, and <b>190</b><sub>3</sub>, similar to the embodiment of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>45</b>-<b>47</b></figref>, so that the dirt outlets <b>190</b><sub>1</sub>, <b>190</b><sub>2</sub>, and <b>190</b><sub>3 </sub>can be positioned proximate the downstream end of the air inlet <b>184</b>. Alternately, an insert member may be used to define the extent of the dirt outlets <b>190</b><sub>1</sub>, <b>190</b><sub>2</sub>, and <b>190</b><sub>3</sub>. Alternately, the dirt outlets <b>190</b><sub>1</sub>, <b>190</b><sub>2</sub>, and <b>190</b><sub>3 </sub>may extend to the front end of cyclone <b>152</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0263" num="0270">In the example shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>48</b>-<b>49</b></figref>, each dirt outlet <b>190</b><sub>1</sub>, <b>190</b><sub>2</sub>, and <b>190</b><sub>3 </sub>connects the cyclone chamber <b>154</b> to a separate dirt collection chamber <b>156</b><sub>1</sub>, <b>156</b><sub>2</sub>, and <b>1563</b>. This may reduce the amount of the air flow which diverts into each dirt collection chamber <b>156</b>, which in turn may reduce the re-entrainment of collected dirt that can result from such divergence.</p>
<p id="p-0264" num="0271">Alternately, the plurality of dirt outlets <b>190</b> may be connected to a single dirt collection chamber <b>156</b>.

<heading id="h-0008" level="2">Cyclone Air Outlet</heading>
<p id="p-0265" num="0272">Embodiments herein relate to an improved cyclonic air outlet. The features in this section may be used by themselves in any surface cleaning apparatus or in any combination or sub-combination with any other feature or features described herein.</p>
<p id="p-0266" num="0273">As exemplified in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref>, cyclone chamber outlet passage <b>192</b> may have any shape that can provide an outlet passage for air exiting cyclone chamber <b>154</b>. Cyclone chamber outlet passage <b>192</b> may extend longitudinally from a passage second end <b>276</b> at cyclone second end <b>208</b> towards cyclone first end <b>206</b> (e.g. in parallel with cyclone longitudinal axis <b>204</b>) to a passage first end <b>280</b>. As shown, cyclone chamber outlet passage <b>192</b> may be spaced apart from cyclone sidewall <b>202</b> to define a surrounding annular region between cyclone chamber outlet passage <b>192</b> and cyclone sidewall <b>202</b> that promotes cyclonic air flow through cyclone chamber <b>154</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0267" num="0274">In the illustrated embodiment, cyclone chamber outlet passage <b>192</b> has a transverse width <b>288</b> (e.g. diameter) that is substantially constant (e.g. varies by less than 10%) between passage first end <b>280</b> and passage second end <b>276</b>. Depending on the size and shape of cyclone sidewall <b>202</b>, this may provide the air flow path through cyclone chamber <b>154</b> with a relatively constant cross-sectional area.</p>
<p id="p-0268" num="0275">In accordance with this feature, as exemplified in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>22</b></figref>, cyclone chamber outlet passage <b>192</b> may have a transverse width <b>288</b> that increases between passage first end <b>280</b> and passage second end <b>276</b> towards passage second end <b>276</b>. In other words, cyclone chamber outlet passage <b>192</b> may taper in transverse width <b>288</b> towards passage first end <b>280</b>. Depending on the size and shape of cyclone sidewall <b>202</b>, this may provide the air flow path through cyclone chamber <b>154</b> with a shrinking cross-sectional area as the air flow travels from cyclone air inlet <b>184</b> towards cyclone second end <b>208</b>. As a result of the inverse relationship between cross-sectional area and velocity, the progressive reduction in cross-sectional flow area may increase the flow velocity towards cyclone second end <b>208</b>. This may mitigate a loss of velocity and cyclonic degradation that may develop towards cyclone second end <b>208</b> particularly when operating at low flow rates (e.g. in a lower power mode). Consequently, the tapered cyclone chamber outlet passage <b>192</b> may promote greater overall separation efficiency for cyclone <b>152</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0269" num="0276">As shown, transverse width <b>288</b> may increase continuously between passage first end <b>280</b> and passage second end <b>276</b>. In some embodiments, transverse width <b>288</b> may increase by at least 10% (e.g. by 10% to 200%, 25% to 175%, 40% to 125% or 60% to 90%) between passage first end <b>280</b> and passage second end <b>276</b>. In the illustrated embodiment, transverse width <b>288</b> increases by about 125% between passage first end <b>280</b> and passage second end <b>276</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0270" num="0277">As exemplified, passage first end <b>280</b> may be solid and may have an axial length that is at least as long as, or longer than, the axial inward extent of the cyclone air inlet. Accordingly, air that enters the cyclone chamber may not directly enter the outlet passage <b>192</b>, as the first end <b>280</b> is solid.</p>
<p id="p-0271" num="0278">Although many of the figures illustrate concepts and embodiments applied to an exemplary handvac, all of the embodiments described herein apply equally to other surface cleaning apparatus (e.g. upright vacuums, canister vacuums, etc.). Further, although many of the figures illustrate a uniflow cyclone that is horizontally oriented, all embodiments disclosed here are also applicable to other cyclone configurations and orientations. As an example, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>24</b>-<b>25</b></figref> show an upright vacuum <b>100</b> having a cyclonic air treatment member <b>116</b> with an inverted cyclone <b>152</b>. As shown, cyclone <b>152</b> has a central longitudinal axis <b>204</b> that is vertically oriented, a plurality of dirt outlet regions <b>190</b> (which may have any configuration disclosed in any embodiment herein), a cyclone chamber air outlet passage <b>192</b> (which may have any configuration disclosed in any embodiment here), and both the cyclone air inlet <b>184</b> and outlet <b>188</b> are located at cyclone first end <b>206</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0272" num="0279">Reference is now made to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>26</b>-<b>27</b></figref>. In some embodiments, a dirt outlet region <b>190</b> may provide an entryway to a dirt outlet passage <b>292</b> leading to dirt collection chamber <b>156</b>. This may be the case for the only dirt outlet region <b>190</b> of a cyclone <b>152</b> as shown, or for one or more (or all) dirt outlet regions <b>190</b> of a cyclone <b>152</b> having many dirt outlet regions <b>190</b> (e.g. as in any embodiment disclosed herein having two or more dirt outlets <b>190</b>). An advantage of providing a dirt outlet passage <b>292</b> between a dirt outlet region <b>190</b> and the dirt collection chamber <b>156</b> is that it may reduce the amount of air flow that diverts from the cyclone chamber <b>154</b> into the dirt collection chamber <b>156</b>. Diverted air flow can produce a pressure drop in the air flow through cyclone <b>152</b>, which may result in less suction and possibly lower dirt separation efficiency all else being equal. By mitigating pressure drops, a smaller, lighter, less expensive suction motor may be used to achieve the same suction, or greater suction may be achieved with the same suction motor. Further, diverted air flow may disturb dirt that has collected in dirt collection chamber <b>156</b>, which may lead to that dirt re-emerging into the cyclone chamber <b>154</b> through the dirt outlet region <b>190</b>. A dirt outlet passage <b>292</b> may help to mitigate dirt collected in dirt collection chamber <b>156</b> from returning to cyclone chamber <b>154</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0273" num="0280">Dirt outlet passage <b>292</b> has a length <b>296</b> extending from dirt outlet region <b>190</b> to passage outlet <b>304</b>. Passage outlet <b>304</b> may be located inside dirt collection chamber <b>156</b> as shown, or may be formed in a sidewall of dirt collection chamber <b>156</b> (e.g., the outlet end may be a port provided in a sidewall of the dirt collection chamber <b>156</b>). Passage outlet <b>304</b> may have any passage length <b>296</b> suitable for directing dirt exiting from cyclone chamber <b>154</b> at a dirt outlet region <b>190</b> to dirt collection chamber <b>156</b>. Preferably, passage length <b>296</b> is greater than a thickness of cyclone chamber sidewall <b>202</b>. For example, passage length <b>296</b> may be greater than 5 mm (e.g. between 5 mm and 300 mm, 25-250 mm, 50-200 mm or 75-150 mm). A passage length <b>296</b> closer to 5 mm may be appropriate where, for example, cyclone chamber <b>154</b> and dirt collection chamber <b>156</b> share a common dividing wall <b>202</b>. A passage length much greater than 5 mm (e.g. 50 mm or more) may be appropriate where, for example, cyclone chamber <b>154</b> and dirt collection chamber <b>156</b> are spaced apart.</p>
<p id="p-0274" num="0281">Dirt outlet passage <b>292</b> may extend in any direction from dirt outlet region <b>190</b> towards dirt collection chamber <b>156</b>. In some embodiments, dirt outlet passage <b>292</b> is oriented tangential to cyclone chamber <b>154</b>. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>26</b></figref> shows an example in which dirt outlet passage <b>292</b> is oriented tangential cyclone chamber <b>154</b> in alignment with the direction of cyclone air flow path <b>212</b> where cyclone air flow path <b>212</b> crosses dirt outlet region <b>190</b>. An advantage of this design is that dirt outlet passage <b>292</b> may be oriented in the same direction as the direction of dirt particles at dirt outlet <b>190</b>. This may increase particle separation efficiency by reducing the number of dirt particles which cross over dirt outlet region <b>190</b> without exiting cyclone chamber <b>154</b>. However, such tangential alignment may also lead to a somewhat greater amount of the air flow diverting from cyclone chamber <b>154</b> into dirt collection chamber <b>156</b>. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>27</b></figref> shows an example in which dirt outlet passage <b>292</b> is oriented tangential to cyclone chamber <b>154</b> but extending in a direction opposed to the direction of cyclone air flow path <b>212</b> where cyclone air flow path <b>212</b> crosses dirt outlet <b>190</b>. An advantage of this design is that it may reduce the amount of air that diverts from cyclone chamber <b>154</b> to dirt collection chamber <b>156</b>, although a somewhat greater number of dirt particles may pass over dirt outlet <b>190</b> without exiting.</p>
