<?summary-of-invention description="Summary of Invention" end="lead"?>
<heading id="h-0001" level="1">TECHNOLOGICAL FIELD</heading>
<p id="p-0002" num="0001">The present disclosure is directed to a system and a method for fabrication of a three-dimensional (3D) edible product, and more specifically, to a system and method for fabrication of a 3D edible product by a plurality of discrete applicators.</p>
<heading id="h-0002" level="1">BACKGROUND</heading>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">The world population is growing, and according to FAO it is expected to be 9.6 billion up to 2050. Consequently, the demand for protein of both plant and animal origin is intended to increase. Most of the proteins of animal origin are derived from livestock, which the farming thereof contributes to global warming and also uses a significant amount of resources in comparison with proteins of plant origin. It is known that a plant-based agriculture has a much lower environmental impact with regards to freshwater use, amount of land required, and waste products generated, than agriculture for meat production. As such, increasing the amount of plant derived protein in favor of the animal derived protein is one of the main challenges of the 21<sup>st </sup>century.</p>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">Today, meat substitute products are made with traditional methods and from a homogenous mixture, which does not provide the visual effect nor the texture or appeal of real meat.</p>
<heading id="h-0003" level="2">General Description</heading>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">According to a first aspect of the disclosure there is a disclosed a system for fabrication of a three-dimensional edible product having two or more edible components, comprising:
<ul id="ul0001" list-style="none">
    <li id="ul0001-0001" num="0000">
    <ul id="ul0002" list-style="none">
        <li id="ul0002-0001" num="0005">(a) a processor configured to receive an edible product design having pattern coordinates, and to provide pattern address signals;</li>
        <li id="ul0002-0002" num="0006">(b) a printing mechanism comprising a printing head having two or more sets of a plurality of discrete applicators, each one of the two or more sets is configured to receive and dispense a different edible component, each discrete applicator of the plurality of discrete applicators being configured to receive and selectively dispense, in a continuous or intermittent manner, its corresponding edible component onto a printing support bed in accordance with the pattern address signals received from the processor; and</li>
        <li id="ul0002-0003" num="0007">(c) a driving mechanism configurable to receive said pattern address signals and to control the position of said printing head with respect to a printing support bed;</li>
    </ul>
    </li>
</ul>
</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0008">In operation, the system is configured to receive a design of a meat slab, such as an Entrec&#xf4;te or Sirloin cuts, from a user or from a predefined storage module thereof, so as to fabricate the meat slab in accordance with the design. The design comprises data about the meat slab such as: desired fat content (for example, on the USDA's grading system), size of slab, fiber rigidity and the like. These settings are being translated into a 3D matrix of pattern coordinates by a controller, and accordingly, pattern address signals are sent by the controller to the printing mechanism and the driving mechanism. The printing mechanism is configured to receive pattern address signals as for which edible components are to be used in the fabrication process, instructions as for when to start and cease dispensing of each of the edible components from each of the discrete applicators of the printing head. The driving mechanism is configured to change the position of the printing head with respect to the support bed by controlling the movement of at least one of them.</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0009">In order to receive the edible components and to facilitate them towards the printing head the system can comprise a feeder mechanism. The feeder mechanism can be configured to receive two or more edible components, which can be received from various sources and can be configured to separately manipulate each edible component towards a respective set of discrete applicators.</p>
<p id="p-0008" num="0010">The feeding mechanism can be configured to receive ready-for-use (i.e., off the shelf) containers of edible components. Each of the containers can have a different shape and be configured to enable extraction of the edible component therein in a different manner. For example, the containers of the edible components can be formed in a box/can like shape having a rigid cover (e.g., a can), and the edible component can be extracted therefrom by increasing the pressure within the container while enabling the pressurized material to be facilitated towards the printing head by a maneuvering system (such as a tubing system, conveyer system and the like). In other examples, the edible component can be formed as a flexible container (e.g., elongated sausage) and be provided directly to the printing head, from which it will be dispensed onto the support bed.</p>
<p id="p-0009" num="0011">In other cases, the feeding mechanism can be configured to receive sources of almost-ready edible components and to complete the preparation thereof to form the ready to use form of container.</p>
<p id="p-0010" num="0012">The edible components that can be received by the feeding mechanism can be in the form of liquids (such as water, blood-substitute, oil and the like), solids (such as dough), or semi-liquids (such as high-viscosity or non-Newtonian fluids).</p>
<p id="p-0011" num="0013">The system can further comprise at least one splitter module interconnecting the feeding mechanism and the printing head. The splitter mechanism is configured to split the stream of edible components received thereto into a plurality of streams directed towards their respective set of discrete applicators. The splitter module comprises a body having a splitter inlet configured to receive edible component from the feeding mechanism, and a plurality of splitter outlets configured to provide edible component to each one of the discrete applicators of one of the two or more sets of a plurality of discrete applicators of the printing head.</p>
<p id="p-0012" num="0014">In general, the printing head can comprise two or more sets of discrete applicators, where each of the sets is configured to receive and dispense a different edible component. More specifically, each of the discrete applicators of the set is configured to receive and dispense the edible component of the set in an independent manner from the other discrete applicators and in accordance with signals received from the controller.</p>
<p id="p-0013" num="0015">The discrete applicators in the sets can have a formation with respect to each other, such that the edible component dispensed from one discrete applicator is configured to overlap with the edible component dispensed from its adjacent discrete applicator.</p>
<p id="p-0014" num="0016">In some cases, the printing head can further comprise a printing plate configured to be in fluid communication with the discrete applicators of at least one of the sets along a fluid path, and to dispense edible component therefrom onto the support bed. The printing plate can be configured with outlet ports, that are configured with a predetermined position and in which each two adjacent outlet ports are closer to each other than their respective discrete applicators fluidly connected thereto to enable tighter formation of dispensed edible components onto the support bed.</p>
<p id="p-0015" num="0017">According to a second aspect of the presently disclosed subject matter, there is provided a system for fabrication of a three-dimensional edible product having two or more edible components, comprising:
<ul id="ul0003" list-style="none">
    <li id="ul0003-0001" num="0000">
    <ul id="ul0004" list-style="none">
        <li id="ul0004-0001" num="0018">(a) a processor configured to receive an edible product design having pattern coordinates, and to provide pattern address signals;</li>
        <li id="ul0004-0002" num="0019">(b) a printing support bed;</li>
        <li id="ul0004-0003" num="0020">(c) a printing mechanism comprising a printing head configured with two or more sets of a plurality of discrete applicators, each one of the two or more sets is configured to receive and selectively dispense, in a continuous or intermittent manner, one of the two or more different edible components in a distinct manner onto the printing support bed in accordance with the pattern address signals received from the processor; and</li>
        <li id="ul0004-0004" num="0021">(d) a driving mechanism configurable to receive said pattern address signals so as to control the position of the printing support bed with respect to the printing head.</li>
    </ul>
    </li>
</ul>
</p>
<p id="p-0016" num="0022">In general, the driving mechanism can be configurable to control the position of the support bed with respect to the printing head, or vise versa, in accordance with the pattern signals received from the processor/controller. For that purpose, the driving mechanism can be configured with drive elements in order to maneuver the printing head and/or the support bed.</p>
<p id="p-0017" num="0023">According to a third aspect of the disclosure there is a system for fabrication of a three-dimensional edible product having two or more edible components, comprising:</p>
<p id="p-0018" num="0024">(a) a processor configured to receive an edible product design having pattern coordinates, and to provide pattern address signals;</p>

<p id="p-0021" num="0027">(d) a driving mechanism configurable to receive said pattern address signals and to control the position of said printing head with respect to the printing support bed;</p>
<p id="p-0022" num="0028">wherein each discrete applicator is configured to selectively dispense, in a continuous or intermittent manner, one of the two or more edible components onto the support bed in accordance with pattern address signals received from the processor.</p>
<p id="p-0023" num="0029">According to a fourth aspect of the disclosure there is a disclosed a method for fabricating a three-dimensional edible product comprising two or more edible components in accordance with pattern address signals, comprising:</p>
<p id="p-0024" num="0030">(a) providing a printing support bed by which said edible product is supported while being fabricated;</p>
<p id="p-0025" num="0031">(b) providing a printing mechanism comprising at least one printing head having a plurality of discrete applicators, for dispensing, in a continuous or intermittent manner, a plurality of strands of two or more different edible compositions provided to said printing mechanism onto said printing support bed, in accordance with the pattern address signals, so as to form a product layer; and</p>

<heading id="h-0005" level="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF EMBODIMENTS</heading>
<p id="p-0051" num="0079">Attention is first directed to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>1</b>A-<b>1</b>C</figref> illustrating a schematic view of an example of a system for fabrication of a three-dimensional edible product <b>100</b>, also referred to simply as system <b>100</b> hereafter. The system <b>100</b> comprises a housing <b>110</b>, a printing mechanism <b>120</b> configured to fabricate an edible product A, a printing support bed <b>200</b> configured to support the edible product A while being fabricated by the printing mechanism <b>120</b>, a driving mechanism <b>250</b> and a controller <b>300</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0052" num="0080">In general, the system <b>100</b> is configured to receive at least two edible components, and to fabricate thereby the edible product A by the printing mechanism <b>120</b>. The printing mechanism <b>120</b> can be configured to receive and dispense each of the edible components in a separate manner on the printing support bed <b>200</b>, which can be integral to or integrated with the system <b>100</b>. In some cases, as illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b>A</figref>, the printing mechanism <b>120</b> can comprise two or more sets of discrete applicators in order to receive and dispense, in a separate manner, each of the edible components so as to fabricate a product layer. The fabrication process of the product layer is configured to occur in a repeatable manner, layer on top of layer, such that each layer is fabricated on top of a preceding layer. The system <b>100</b> is also configured to receive, by the controller <b>300</b> thereof, an edible product design, and to provide pattern address signals to the printing mechanism <b>120</b> in accordance to which each of the edible components is fabricated by the printing mechanism in a time dependent manner so as to form each layer, and thereby the product.</p>
<p id="p-0053" num="0081">In an example of the present invention, the housing is formed as an elongated cube comprising a longitudinal print axis P, a latitudinal cross-print axis XP and a height axis Z. The print axis P is the axis along which the edible product A is mainly fabricated, and on which long fibers of edible component mimicking the fibers of a real meat slab are dispensed. In another example of the present example (not illustrated), the housing <b>110</b> can be formed as a circular chamber and can comprise a circular print axis P, a radial cross-print axis XP and a height axis Z. In such example, the printing mechanism can be positioned at the center and the printing support bed can be formed in a ring shape encompassing the printing mechanism.</p>

The housing <b>110</b> is configured to provide suitable conditions for manufacturing foodstuff products, such as controlled temperature, filtration mechanism, smooth surfaces and the like. In some cases, the mechanical portion <b>112</b> and the fabricating portion <b>114</b> are isolated from each other by a barrier <b>113</b>, through which a portion of the printing mechanism <b>120</b> sealingly protrudes to the fabricating portion <b>114</b> in order to fabricate the edible product.</p>
<p id="p-0055" num="0083">The housing <b>110</b> is configured with a component receiving end <b>115</b>, through which a user may provide sources of edible components for the printing mechanism <b>120</b>, and a product releasing end <b>116</b>, through which the fabricated edible products A can be withdrawn. Although the housing <b>110</b> is shown in a rectangular box-like geometry, other configurations could be used.</p>
<p id="p-0056" num="0084">In general, the system can also comprise one or more subsystems within the housing configured to perform multiple operations, either during the fabrication process or at the end thereof. Such operations can comprise dispensing solids or fluids containing color additives, spices, &#x2018;blood&#x2019;-like substitute and other food additives on the slab. The same subsystems can be configured to dispense the food additives on the slab in a plurality of methods such as spraying, dispersing and the like.</p>
<p id="p-0057" num="0085">In the present example, the system can include the following subsystems:
<ul id="ul0007" list-style="none">
    <li id="ul0007-0001" num="0000">
    <ul id="ul0008" list-style="none">

    </ul>
    </li>
</ul>
</p>
<p id="p-0058" num="0090">The printing mechanism <b>120</b>, the printing support bed <b>200</b> and the driving mechanism <b>250</b> of the system <b>100</b> are illustrated, at different formations and combinations thereof, in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>2</b>A-<b>2</b>B</figref>, with the housing <b>110</b> omitted therefrom for illustration purposes. In the embodiment shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b>A</figref> the fabricating portion <b>114</b>, contains two printing support bed <b>200</b> parallelly driven by driving mechanism <b>250</b>. Such arrangement allows printing and post fabrication processing to take place in concurrently, as will be discussed further below.</p>
<p id="p-0059" num="0091">As schematically shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b>B</figref>, the printing mechanism <b>120</b> comprises a feeding mechanism <b>130</b>, and a printing head <b>150</b> having two or more sets of discrete applicators <b>160</b> in fluid communication with the feeding mechanism <b>130</b>. The printing head <b>150</b> is configured to dispense the two or more edible components received from the feeding mechanism <b>130</b> onto the printing support bed.</p>
<p id="p-0060" num="0092">In general, the feeding mechanism <b>130</b> can be located either within the mechanical portion <b>112</b> of the housing or external thereto, and is configured to receive two or more sources (i.e., containers) of edible components. The feeding mechanism <b>130</b> can comprise at least one pressurizing element or propelling element, configured to facilitate movement of the edible component towards the printing mechanism.

In other embodiments (not shown), the feeding mechanism <b>130</b> can comprise as many pressurizing elements such that each discrete applicator of the two or more sets of discrete applicators <b>160</b> is configured with its respective pressurizing element. The feeding mechanism <b>130</b> can be configured to receive solid and liquid edible components. In some cases, the feeding mechanism can be configured to receive and release liquid edible component into solid edible component to increase the hydration percentage thereof.</p>
<p id="p-0061" num="0093">In the present example, best illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>3</b>A and <b>3</b>B</figref>, the feeding mechanism <b>130</b> is configured with a receiving base <b>131</b>, which is configured to receive and secure at least one source of an edible component, and in the present example containers C<b>1</b> and C<b>2</b> illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b>A</figref>. For that purpose, the receiving base <b>131</b> can be configured with source positioning portion <b>131</b>A, that is configured to provide position indication to the position in the feeding mechanism <b>130</b> in which optimal usage of the edible components stored in the containers can be achieved. As shown, the feeding mechanism <b>130</b> comprises a first and a second pressurizing elements <b>132</b>A and <b>132</b>B that are configured to induce pressure in their respective. The first and a second pressurizing elements <b>132</b>A and <b>132</b>B are illustrated as press mechanisms each having a cylinder <b>133</b> and a piston <b>134</b> having a disc shape and configured to be pressed by the cylinder into containers C<b>1</b> and C<b>2</b>. In other examples, the first and a second pressurizing elements <b>132</b>A and <b>132</b>B can be formed with any other pressure inducing devices known to a person having skill in the art. The pressure applied by each of the first and a second pressurizing elements <b>132</b>A and <b>132</b>B is configured to facilitate a stream of edible component from its respective container towards the printing head <b>150</b> which is fluidly connected to the feeding mechanism <b>130</b> via a tubing system <b>125</b> (schematically shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b>B</figref>).</p>
<p id="p-0062" num="0094">In some cases, the feeding mechanism <b>130</b> can be configured with a flexible pressurizing element (not shown), that is configured to induce pressure inside containers that do not fit within the container receiving base <b>131</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0063" num="0095">In another example illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b>C</figref>, the feeding mechanism <b>130</b> is configured to receive ingredients forming an edible components or ready to use edible components. For that purpose, the feeding mechanism comprises a feeding inlet <b>135</b>, configured to receive ingredients or ready to use edible component and a pressurizing element <b>136</b> configured to apply pressure inside feeding mechanism <b>130</b> as to facilitate the edible component towards the printing head <b>150</b>. Optionally, feeding mechanism may also include a processing unit <b>137</b> which receives the ingredients forming edible component via the feeding inlet <b>135</b> and completes the preparation thereof to create ready to use edible component. In such case, pressurizing element <b>136</b> is configured to apply pressure inside the processing unit <b>137</b> so as to facilitate the edible component generated at the processing unit <b>137</b> towards the printing head <b>150</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0064" num="0096">In general, the pressurizing elements can be customized for each specific edible component intended to be used during the fabrication process, and for a plurality of containers in which they arrive. It should be emphasized that in the present example, at least one of the edible component is configured with high-viscosity properties as detailed in publication No. PCT/IL2020/050099 of the applicant, which is hereby incorporated by reference. In some cases, each of the pressurizing elements can be configured to induce and maintain a pressure of about 50 Bar, preferably 10-40, and more specifically, about 20-30 Bar in the tubing system.</p>
<p id="p-0065" num="0097">The tubing system is configured to facilitate the edible component inside the printing mechanism <b>120</b> towards the sets of discrete applicators of the printing head. In some cases, the tubing system can be further configured to control the temperature of the edible component facilitated therein. In order to provide each of the discrete applicators with equally pressurized edible component, which in some cases, is less than the pressure provided by the feeding mechanism <b>130</b>. For that purpose, the printing mechanism <b>120</b> can further comprise a splitter module <b>140</b>, that is configured to receive a single pressurized stream of edible component and to provide a plurality of pressurized, or less pressurized, streams of the edible component.</p>
<p id="p-0066" num="0098">In general, the printing mechanism can comprise a splitter module for each of the two or more sets of discrete applicators. Each splitter module can fluidly interconnect the tubing arriving from the feeding mechanism to the printing head. in some cases, each splitter module can comprise a splitter body having a splitter inlet configured to receive pressurized edible component from the feeding mechanism and a plurality of splitter outlets configured to release said sub-streams of edible component out from the splitter module and towards the printing head. In some cases, all of the sub-streams provided from the splitter outlets can have about same pressure and flow rate.</p>
<p id="p-0067" num="0099">As used herein the term &#x201c;about&#x201d; relates to a change of up to 10% from the corresponding property to which it relates. In other cases, the pressure can be reduced inside the splitter and be omitted therefrom in a reduced pressure. In yet other cases, the pressure can be increased inside the splitter module and be omitted therefrom in an increased pressure.</p>
<p id="p-0068" num="0100">In some cases, the splitter outlets can be constituted from a plurality of branching tubes, extending from the splitter inlet itself or from another branching tubes, either of same size or larger).</p>
<p id="p-0069" num="0101">In an example of the splitter module disclosed in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>4</b>A-<b>4</b>C</figref>, the splitter <b>140</b> is formed in a similar manner to a flower bouquet having a single splitter inlet <b>142</b> (as the trunk) and a plurality of splitter outlets <b>144</b> branching therefrom. The splitter <b>140</b> comprises a plurality of edible material flow paths, identical to the number of splitter outlets <b>144</b>, for example, F<b>1</b> extends between the splitter inlet <b>142</b> to splitter outlet <b>144</b>A.</p>
<p id="p-0070" num="0102">The splitter <b>140</b> of the present example is further configured with a plurality of branching tubes <b>145</b> extending between the splitter inlet <b>142</b> and the splitter outlets <b>144</b>. Each of the branching tubes <b>145</b> is configured with a proximal receiving end <b>146</b> constituted as the splitter inlet <b>142</b> or configured to be connected to a preceding branching tube <b>145</b>, and two or more releasing ends <b>147</b> at a distal end thereof, branching off in an identical manner from the receiving end <b>146</b>. In some cases, the number of branching tubes <b>145</b> tubes along each edible material flow path may. The plurality of branching tubes <b>145</b> can vary in their diameters. In some cases, the receiving end <b>146</b> is configured with a diameter larger than the diameter of the releasing ends <b>147</b>, thereby forming branching tubes <b>145</b> of different sizes that are configured to split the received stream of edible component into narrower and narrower streams of equal pressure and release said streams from the splitter outlet <b>144</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0071" num="0103">Attention is now drawn to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>5</b>A to <b>5</b>B</figref>, illustrating an example of the printing head <b>150</b> of the present disclosure. In general, the printing head <b>150</b> is configured to be in fluid communication with the feeding mechanism <b>130</b> via the tubing system <b>125</b> and is configured to receive at least two streams of edible components therefrom.

In some cases, the discrete applicators <b>160</b>A can be configured with a slicing element configured to cut off the stream of edible component applicated from each of the applicators. The slicing element can be a plurality of slicing elements associated with each of the discrete extruders or a single slicing element associated with the entire set.</p>
<p id="p-0073" num="0105">In the present example, the printing head <b>150</b> comprises a first, a second and a third sets of discrete applicators <b>151</b>, <b>152</b> and <b>153</b>, each of which is fluidly connected to the feeding mechanism <b>130</b> which provides a different edible component to each set. Each of the sets of discrete applicators <b>151</b>, <b>152</b> and <b>153</b> comprises identical number of discrete applicators <b>160</b>A, which are arranged in the same formation in an identical manner and in parallel to each of the other sets. In other cases, each of the sets of discrete applicators <b>151</b>, <b>152</b> and <b>153</b> can include a different number of discrete applicators than the others.</p>
<p id="p-0074" num="0106">In some cases, the discrete applicators <b>160</b>A of each one of the sets of discrete applicators <b>151</b>, <b>152</b> and <b>153</b> are arranged one next to each other in two rows, being indented to each other. In such cases, the discrete applicators are configured to dispense the edible component such that the fabricated edible component is in contact communication with the fabricated edible component of its adjacent discrete applicator to prevent spaces in the product layer.</p>
<p id="p-0075" num="0107">In accordance with some examples of the present disclosure, the printing head <b>150</b> can further comprise a scaffold holder <b>155</b> (shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b>C</figref>). The scaffold holder <b>155</b> comprises an external frame <b>156</b>, which can be configured to be firmly connected to the housing <b>110</b>, and two or more pairs of fixing strips, each matching a set of discrete applicators disposed in parallel to each other along the length of the frame. In other cases (not illustrated), the scaffold holder can be movably connected to the housing by an articulated arm, enabling it to be maneuvered with respect to the printing bed and/or to other printing heads (if any).</p>
<p id="p-0076" num="0108">In general, each set of discrete applicators <b>160</b> can comprise (in its homogeneous configuration) different types of discrete applicators. Each of which is adapted to fabricate the specific edible component received thereby. In other cases, each discrete applicator <b>160</b>A can be configured to fabricate many types of different edible components.</p>
<p id="p-0077" num="0109">In the present example, each one of the discrete applicators <b>160</b>A comprises an elongated body <b>161</b> having a central axis Y extending along the length thereof and having a propelling mechanism <b>170</b> operably connected thereto. The elongated body <b>161</b> comprises a shaft <b>164</b> extending therein along the vertical axis Y and having a top opening <b>164</b>A and a bottom opening <b>164</b>B. The elongated body <b>161</b> further comprises an edible component inlet <b>165</b> positioned about a top end <b>162</b> of the shaft <b>164</b> being in fluid communication with the shaft <b>164</b> and an applicator outlet <b>166</b> positioned at a bottom end <b>163</b> of the shaft <b>164</b> (i.e., constituting the bottom opening <b>164</b>B).</p>
<p id="p-0078" num="0110">In general, the propelling mechanism <b>170</b> can be configured to receive pattern address signals from the controller <b>300</b> and operate on the elongated body <b>161</b> accordingly, so as to propel edible component received from the edible component inlet <b>165</b> towards and outwards from the bottom opening <b>164</b>B of the shaft <b>164</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0079" num="0111">In the present example, the propelling mechanism <b>170</b> of each discrete applicator comprises a propelling engine <b>171</b> and a propelling element <b>172</b> having an actuated end <b>172</b>A operably connected to the propelling engine <b>171</b> and a propelling portion <b>172</b>B, configured to snuggly fit within the shaft <b>164</b>. The propelling element <b>172</b> can be formed, for example, as an auger pump or a progressive cavity pump (PCP). In a specific example illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>6</b>A-<b>6</b>D</figref>, the propelling element <b>172</b> is formed as an auger bit, snuggly fitted within said shaft <b>164</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0080" num="0112">In general, the fluid path between the feeding mechanism <b>130</b> and the bottom opening <b>164</b>B of the shaft <b>164</b> can be uninterrupted by valves or shutters disrupting the flow of the edible component. As such, the shaft <b>164</b> and the propelling element <b>172</b> can be configured with certain properties in order to induce a predetermined amount of friction within the shaft <b>164</b> of each discrete applicator <b>160</b>A, so as to precisely control the flow of edible component dispensed therefrom. In some cases, the shaft <b>164</b> can have a relatively small diameter and a sufficient length, such that the fluid path extending around/about the propelling element <b>172</b>, from the edible component inlet <b>165</b> to the applicator outlet <b>166</b>, is designed/configured to provides the sufficient amount of friction in order to arrest flow of said edible component arriving from the fluid inlet <b>165</b> without further propelling of the propelling element <b>172</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0081" num="0113">In the present example, the propelling element <b>172</b> is an auger pump comprising an inner diameter in the range of 5-12 mm and specifically 9 mm, a spin rate of 1 to 4 and length in the range of 35 mm to 100 mm.</p>
<p id="p-0082" num="0114">In some cases, the bottom opening <b>164</b>B of the shaft <b>164</b> can be configured with a drool prevention element (not shown), configured to cease further application of the edible component after receiving such signal from the controller <b>300</b>. Such cases can occur when the length between each discrete applicator and the splitting module and/or feed mechanism is different, or that there is not enough vacant space in the shaft <b>164</b> for the edible component to be arrested by the friction thereof. such drool prevention element can be a shutter installed on the bottom opening <b>164</b>B of the shaft <b>164</b>, or a controller that is configured to arrange the timing of the signals sent to the printing mechanism <b>120</b> while taking into consideration the duration of the application of edible material, the distance of the applicator from the feed mechanism and the like.</p>
<p id="p-0083" num="0115">In an example of the present disclosure, the discrete applicators may be configured with a certain diameter such that no contact exists between the edible product that is dispensed therefrom and the edible product that is dispensed from its adjacent discrete applicator. In such cases (along with other cases), the printing head can comprise an intermediate element, fluidly connected by tubes to each discrete applicator of the at least one set, and having smaller dimensions than the applicator along the XP axis (such that long fibers of edible component can be fabricated, while being in contact with each other).</p>
<p id="p-0084" num="0116">In the present example, the printing plate <b>180</b>, as best illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>1</b>C, <b>7</b>A and <b>7</b>B</figref>, comprises an inlet surface <b>181</b>, an outlet surface <b>182</b> and a plurality of apertures <b>183</b> transversing the plate from the inlet surface <b>181</b> to the outlet surface <b>182</b>. The apertures are configured with inlet ports <b>184</b> at the inlet surface <b>181</b> side thereof to which the printing head <b>150</b> is fluidly connected via a secondary tubing elements. In some cases, two applicators of the printing head <b>150</b> can be fluidly connected to the same inlet port <b>184</b>. In some cases, at least one applicator can be connected to two or more inlet ports <b>184</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0085" num="0117">The apertures are also configured with outlet ports <b>185</b> at the outlet surface <b>182</b> side thereof from which edible product can be fabricated onto the printing support bed <b>200</b>. As shown, each inlet ports <b>184</b> is fixedly connected to the printing plate <b>180</b> by screws <b>186</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0086" num="0118">In some cases, the apertures <b>183</b> of the printing plate can be arranged in several arrays, each of which can be configured with a different diameter to fit the edible component that is configured to be fabricated therethrough. in some cases, a single discrete applicator can be fluidly connected to two or more inlet ports <b>184</b>. For example, the three lateral inlet ports on each lateral side can be fluidly connected to a single discrete applicator since they are configured to fabricate a wall portion of the meat slab, which always fabricated from the same material entirely.</p>
<p id="p-0087" num="0119">In some cases, the distance between each pair of the plurality of apertures <b>183</b> on the printing plate <b>180</b>, at least along the XP axis, is configured to be smaller than the distance between the central axes Y of each respective pair of the discrete applicators <b>160</b> fluidly connected thereto.</p>
<p id="p-0088" num="0120">In some cases, each of the discrete applicators <b>160</b> or their respective outlet ports <b>185</b>, can further comprise an elevating motor (not shown) configured to draw near or to distance it from the printing support bed <b>200</b> independently of one another.</p>
<p id="p-0089" num="0121">In general, the printing support bed <b>200</b> can be configured to support, retain and/or hold the edible product A or an object onto which edible product A can be fabricated. For that purpose, the printing support bed <b>200</b> can be moveable with respect to the printing mechanism <b>120</b>. The printing support bed <b>200</b> can be constituted by two printing support beds <b>200</b>, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b>A</figref> such that when the printing head <b>150</b> fabricates edible components on a first printing support bed positioned at least partly underneath the printing head <b>150</b>, a second printing support bed can enable post processing of edible components fabricated thereon earlier away from the printing head <b>150</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0090" num="0122">In the present example, the printing support bed <b>200</b> comprises a bed surface <b>202</b>, which can move with respect to the printing head <b>150</b> by the driving mechanism <b>250</b> and in accordance with signals received from the controller <b>300</b>. For example, the bed surface <b>202</b> can be configured to maneuver along the P axis and the Z axis, while the printing head <b>150</b> is configured to be maneuvered along the XP axis by the driving mechanism <b>250</b>. In some cases, the bed surface <b>202</b> can be configured to rotate and/or tilt about one or more axes associated with the bed surface <b>202</b>. Thus, it is contemplated that in at least some embodiments, the bed surface <b>202</b> may be moved into any desired relative configuration with the printing head <b>150</b>. For that purpose, the printing support bed <b>200</b> comprises a bed body <b>201</b>, to which the bed surface <b>202</b> is operably connected by an adjusting mechanism <b>203</b>, configured to enable the printing support bed the aforementioned movements. The bed body <b>201</b> is further configured with a moveable portion <b>204</b> configured to be moved by the driving mechanism <b>250</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0091" num="0123">In general, the driving mechanism <b>250</b> is configured to maneuver the printing support bed <b>200</b> relative to the printing head <b>150</b>. As would be apparent for the skilled in the art, this may be achieved by moving printing head <b>150</b> relative to support bed <b>200</b>, moving support bed <b>200</b> relative to printing head <b>150</b> or any combination thereof (e.g., in the drawn embodiment of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>1</b>B, <b>1</b>C</figref> in Cartesian coordinated-support bed <b>200</b> moves in P and Z direction and printing head <b>200</b> move in XP direction). For that purpose, the driving mechanism <b>250</b> can be in electrical communication with the controller <b>300</b> for receiving pattern signals therefrom so as to control the movement of either the printing support bed <b>200</b> or the printing head <b>150</b>. In further cases, the driving mechanism <b>250</b> can be configured to maneuver the printing plate relative to the set of discrete applicators connected thereto. The relative position of the printing support bed <b>200</b> relative to the printing head can be achieved using either a Cartesian and/or cylindrical axes system.</p>
<p id="p-0092" num="0124">In the present example, the driving mechanism <b>250</b> comprises a railing module <b>251</b> comprising two rails <b>251</b>A and <b>251</b>B, extending in parallel to each other and inverted to each other. The two rails <b>251</b>A and <b>251</b>B extend from at least beneath the printing head <b>150</b>, each towards its respective opposite lateral ends of the housing <b>110</b>. In the embodiment shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b>A</figref> driving mechanism <b>250</b> includes two separate pairs of rails <b>251</b>A and <b>251</b>B, each pair carries one of the support beds <b>200</b>. The driving mechanism <b>250</b> comprises an engine <b>252</b>, configured to move the moveable portion <b>204</b> of a respective printing support bed <b>200</b> on its respective rail from a fabrication position, in which the printing support bed is positioned at least somewhat underneath a portion of the printing head (such as the printing plate <b>180</b>) to a post processing position, in which any fabricated material dispensed on the bed surface <b>202</b> is allowed to be cured.</p>
<p id="p-0093" num="0125">As discussed above, the system <b>100</b> comprises the controller <b>300</b> which is configured to receive and provide information to and from a user, either local or remote and/or controller from and to the printing mechanism <b>120</b>. The controller <b>300</b> can include a processor <b>310</b> and a communication module <b>320</b>. Generally, the term &#x201c;processor&#x201d; refers to the computing resources of a single computer, a portion of the computing resources of a single computer, and/or two or more computers in communication with one another. Any of these resources can be operated by one or more users. In some cases, the controller <b>300</b> can include one or more interfaces, for example, the controller can comprise a print server responsible for providing pattern address signals for the printing head <b>150</b>, the driving mechanism <b>250</b> and the printing support bed <b>200</b>, while a separate interface, either locally or remotely in communication with the print server (e.g., desktop, laptop or tablet) may allow a user to provide edible product designs to the system <b>100</b>. The controller <b>300</b> can also include one or more storage modules for storing edible product designs received by the system.</p>
