<heading level="1" id="h-0002">FIELD</heading>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">The subject disclosure relates to brushing, scrubbing, and general cleaning, and more particularly, to implements which concurrently brush plural tooth surfaces.</p>
<heading level="1" id="h-0003">BACKGROUND</heading>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">The field of teeth cleaning includes a number of approaches to brushing teeth. In the very basic, conventional approach is to provide a manually operated single brush head which the user applies to a single tooth or two overlapping teeth at a time until the user moves on.</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">Other approaches use electric powered toothbrushes in response to the ineffective approach of manual toothbrushes. Some electric toothbrushes power a single head in either a rotary motion (where the brush head spins) or in a reciprocating motion. Still, the single brush head approach requires time to apply the brush to each tooth.</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">Some devices have proposed multiple toothbrush heads but are limited in their effectiveness because of choice in the range of motion which for some is, for example, along an axis into and out of the user&#x2019;s mouth. As may be seen, this may be ineffective because the direction of brushing does not follow the front face of the front teeth, which are the teeth most visible to others. Still yet, the rear surface of the front teeth may likewise be generally missed by such an approach.</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">In some instances, conventional brushing devices lack enough bristles to adequately reach each tooth surface simultaneously.</p>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">As can be seen, there is a need for a device that improves the coverage of teeth and thereby reduces the amount of time it takes.</p>
<heading level="1" id="h-0004">SUMMARY</heading>
<p id="p-0009" num="0008">In one aspect of the disclosure, a teeth cleaning system is disclosed. The system comprises: an arcuate tray configured to receive a set of teeth, wherein the tray includes: an inner arcuate wall, an outer arcuate wall, a baffle positioned transversely across between an inner surface of the outer arcuate wall and an inner surface of the inner arcuate wall and defining an upper channel for receiving teeth of an upper jaw and defining a lower channel for receiving teeth of a lower jaw, and a plurality of bristles positioned in the upper channel and in the lower channel; a handle; a connector, wherein the arcuate tray is coupled to the handle by the connector; a motor coupled to the handle; and an oscillator coupled to the connector, wherein the oscillator is configured to move the arcuate tray side-to-side along the same plane as the baffle in response to operation of the motor.</p>
<p id="p-0010" num="0009">In another aspect of the disclosure, a teeth cleaning system is disclosed which, comprises: an arcuate tray configured to receive a set of teeth, wherein the tray includes: an inner arcuate wall, an outer arcuate wall, a baffle positioned transversely across between an inner surface of the outer arcuate wall and an inner surface of the inner arcuate wall and defining an upper channel for receiving teeth of an upper jaw and defining a lower channel for receiving teeth of a lower jaw, and a plurality of bristles positioned in the upper channel and in the lower channel, wherein the plurality of bristles comprises a density of between 324 bristles per cm<sup>2</sup> -646 bristles per cm<sup>2</sup>; a handle; a connector, wherein the arcuate tray is coupled to the handle by the connector; and a motor coupled to the handle, wherein operation of the motor brushes the teeth of the upper jaw and brushes the teeth of the lower jaw.</p>
<p id="p-0011" num="0010">In yet another aspect of the disclosure a teeth cleaning system is disclosed which, comprises: an arcuate tray configured to receive a set of teeth, wherein the tray includes: an inner arcuate wall, an outer arcuate wall, a baffle positioned transversely across between an inner surface of the outer arcuate wall and an inner surface of the inner arcuate wall and defining an upper channel for receiving teeth of an upper jaw and defining a lower channel for receiving teeth of a lower jaw, and a plurality of bristles positioned in the upper channel and in the lower channel, wherein the plurality of bristles comprise a density between 324 bristles per cm<sup>2</sup> - 646 bristles per cm<sup>2</sup>, herein a top surface of the baffle and a bottom surface of the baffle, the inner surface of the inner arcuate wall, and the inner surface of the outer arcuate wall each include a plurality of receptacles and wherein the plurality of bristles are positioned in bundles in respective receptacles; a handle; a connector, wherein the arcuate tray is coupled to the handle by the connector; a motor coupled to the handle, wherein operation of the motor brushes the teeth of the upper jaw and brushes the teeth of the lower jaw; and an oscillator coupled to the connector, wherein the oscillator is configured to move the arcuate tray side-to-side along a same plane as the baffle in response to operation of the motor.</p>
<p id="p-0012" num="0011">It is understood that other configurations of the subject technology will become readily apparent to those skilled in the art from the following detailed description, wherein various configurations of the subject technology are shown and described by way of illustration. As will be realized, the subject technology is capable of other and different configurations and its several details are capable of modification in various other respects, all without departing from the scope of the subject technology.

<heading level="1" id="h-0006">DETAILED DESCRIPTION</heading>
<p id="p-0039" num="0038">The detailed description set forth below is intended as a description of various configurations of the subject technology and is not intended to represent the only configurations in which the subject technology may be practiced. The appended drawings are incorporated herein and constitute a part of the detailed description. The detailed description includes specific details for the purpose of providing a thorough understanding of the subject technology. However, it will be apparent to those skilled in the art that the subject technology may be practiced without these specific details. Like or similar components are labeled with identical element numbers for ease of understanding.</p>
<p id="p-0040" num="0039">In general, exemplary embodiments of the subject technology provide a cleaning system for teeth that provides improved coverage area and an improved range of motion to more effectively brush teeth with motorized actuation. It will be appreciated that, aspects of the system include an arrangement of bristles that provide greater bristle density than in previous systems. The greater density covers more tooth surfaces to be brushed. The system includes a motor to automatically actuate the brushing features. The system may automatically brush all tooth surfaces during operation. Another aspect contributing to the improved brushing performance includes the motion of actuation used in some embodiments. The system may be configured to actuate the brushing in a side-to-side range of movement, which may be more natural to users.</p>
<p id="p-0041" num="0040">Referring now to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>, a teeth cleaning system <b>100</b> (referred to generally as the &#x201c;system <b>100</b>&#x201d;) is shown according to an exemplary embodiment. The system <b>100</b> generally includes a tray assembly <b>110</b> (referred to sometimes as &#x201c;tray 11 O&#x201d;) and a handle assembly <b>150</b> (sometimes referred to as the &#x201c;handle <b>150</b>&#x201d;). As will be described in further detail below, the handle assembly <b>150</b> is motorized. The tray <b>110</b> is connected to the handle <b>150</b> so that the tray <b>110</b> is actuated to brush a user&#x2019;s teeth. In general use, the tray assembly <b>110</b> may be inserted into a user&#x2019;s mouth (not shown) axially along an axis &#x201c;a&#x201d;. The axis &#x201c;a&#x2033;&#x201d; represents the line or plane that extends from the bottom of the handle <b>150</b> to front of the tray assembly <b>110</b> and is generally in the direction of insertion. When the handle <b>150</b> is operated, the motor element (described below) may actuate the tray assembly <b>110</b> laterally (relative to the axis &#x201c;a&#x201d;) along an axis &#x201c;/&#x201d;. For example, the left and right sides of the tray <b>110</b> may move toward the left and right sides of the handle <b>150</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0042" num="0041">Referring now to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>2</b>-<b>8</b></figref>, the tray assembly <b>110</b> is shown according to an exemplary embodiment. The tray <b>110</b> may be generally arcuate to loosely index to the shape of a user&#x2019;s jaw. In an exemplary embodiment, the tray <b>110</b> may include an outer arcuate wall <b>115</b> and an inner arcuate wall <b>145</b>. In some embodiments, a baffle <b>135</b> may be positioned transversely to span across between an inner surface <b>120</b> of the outer arcuate wall <b>115</b> and an inner surface <b>125</b> of the inner arcuate wall <b>145</b>. The baffle <b>135</b> may follow the general arcuate shape of the tray <b>110</b>. In some embodiments, the baffle <b>135</b> may be parallel to the plane of the axis&#x2033;/&#x201d; and transverse to the axis &#x201c;a&#x201d; (see <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref>). The arrangement of the baffle <b>135</b> between the outer arcuate wall <b>115</b> and the inner arcuate wall <b>145</b> may define an upper arcuate channel for receiving teeth of an upper jaw and may define an arcuate lower channel for receiving teeth of a lower jaw in use. A plurality of brushing elements <b>130</b> is positioned in the channels of the tray assembly <b>110</b>. The brushing elements <b>130</b> may be for example bristles (sometimes referred to as &#x201c;bristle-hairs&#x201d; or &#x201c;strands&#x201d;). In some embodiments, the bristles may be for example, nylon, microfiber, sponge, organic sponge, fabric, rubber, silicone, or bamboo.</p>
<p id="p-0043" num="0042">In some embodiments, the outer arcuate wall <b>115</b>, the inner arcuate wall <b>145</b>, and the top and bottom surfaces of the baffle <b>135</b> include a plurality of receptacles (holes) (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>6</b> and <b>7</b></figref>). Each of the receptacles may be configured to hold a bundle of bristles <b>130</b>. The free ends of bristles <b>130</b> may be arranged to contact the anterior, posterior, and top surfaces of each tooth (as well as reach in between teeth and gums). In some embodiments, the bundles of bristles projecting from the inner surface <b>120</b> of the outer arcuate wall <b>115</b> and from the inner surface <b>125</b> of the inner arcuate wall <b>145</b> may project at an acute angle relative to the plane of the upper/lower surface of the baffle <b>135</b>. In operation, as the tray <b>100</b> is actuated, the bristles <b>130</b> on the baffle <b>135</b> brush the top surfaces of teeth. The bristles on the inner surface <b>120</b> of the outer arcuate wall <b>115</b> and from the inner surface <b>125</b> of the inner arcuate wall <b>145</b> brush the anterior and posterior surfaces of teeth. The angle of the bristles on the inner surface <b>120</b> of the outer arcuate wall <b>115</b> and from the inner surface <b>125</b> of the inner arcuate wall <b>145</b> promote brushing along the height of a tooth&#x2019;s anterior/posterior face. In some embodiments, the bristles <b>130</b> on the innermost and outermost rows of the baffle <b>135</b> may partially overlap with the bristles <b>130</b> (on the rows closest to the baffle <b>135</b>) on the inner surface <b>120</b> of the outer arcuate wall <b>115</b> and of the inner surface <b>125</b> of the inner arcuate wall <b>145</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0044" num="0043">In an exemplary embodiment, the bristles may be arranged in a density of approximately 42 bristles per hole and 452.4 bristle-hairs per square centimeter. Embodiments may vary the bristle density between 324 bristles per cm<sup>2</sup> - 646 bristles per cm<sup>2</sup>. As will be understood, the density of bristles may vary depending on factors such as bristles per hole, number of holes, spacing of holes, diameter of holes, and diameter of bristle strands used. For example, in embodiments that use softer bristles with thinner strand diameters than the embodiment with 42 bristles per hole, there may be approximately 84 bristles per hole which yields approximately the same density but with a softer brush rating. Similarly, embodiments using firmer bristles with thicker strand diameters may use 24 bristles per hole to achieve the same density. Accordingly, the bristle density may be manipulated by increasing or decreasing the strand diameter and/or the number of strands per hole. In addition, the other aforementioned factors (relating to hole position, size, and spacing) may be manipulated to generate a bristle density within the disclosed range. For example, more empty areas between holes may require more bristles to provide the same density and vice versa.</p>
<p id="p-0045" num="0044">Thus, when referring to &#x201c;bristle density&#x201d;, the subject disclosure encompasses in general the density of bristle material per area with the understanding that substitutions may be made in any of the underlying factors of bristle density while still falling within the scope of the technology herein. The bristle material per area may be based on the diameter of a bristle used in an embodiment multiplied by the numbers of bristles per unit of area.</p>
<p id="p-0046" num="0045">Embodiments may include 327 to 653 holes overall on the surfaces <b>120</b> and <b>125</b>, and on both sides of the baffle <b>135</b>. In an exemplary embodiment, there may be approximately 480 holes overall on the surfaces <b>120</b> and <b>125</b>, and on both sides of the baffle <b>135</b>. Embodiments may position holes with a distance of 1.8 mm to about 0.75 mm between holes. In some embodiments, there may be approximately 7.72 holes per cm<sup>2</sup> of a surface (<b>120</b>, <b>125</b>, <b>135</b>) to approximately 15.38 holes per cm<sup>2</sup>. In an exemplary embodiment, there are approximately 11.31 holes per cm<sup>2</sup>.</p>
<p id="p-0047" num="0046">There may be approximately 42 bent bristles/hole. Embodiments may include a range of approximately 25-55 bristles per hole. The bristle thickness may range from 0.01 mm to 0.2 mm. For embodiments with 42 bristles per hole, the bristle thickness may be approximately 0.15 mm. In total, there may be approximately 13,100 to 26,120 bent bristle hairs inserted into the tray assembly <b>110</b>. In an exemplary embodiment, there may be 19,200 bent bristle hairs inserted into the tray assembly <b>110</b>. As will be seen, the density of bristles is above the conventional density of bristles in previous systems, which leads to improved coverage of the brushing area for the surfaces of teeth. With a minimal range of motion, the system <b>100</b> is able to brush teeth more efficiently. It will be appreciated that this is a significant improvement in technology since the range of space available to move laterally within a user&#x2019;s mouth is limited. The density of bristles <b>130</b> in the subject technology allows for better brushing effectiveness in the limited range of lateral movement.</p>
<p id="p-0048" num="0047">In some embodiments, the inner surface <b>120</b> of the outer arcuate wall <b>115</b> and/or the inner surface <b>125</b> of the inner arcuate wall <b>145</b> may include slots. See <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>6</b> and <b>7</b></figref>. As will be appreciated, the slots <b>112</b> provide flexure in the tray <b>110</b> so that the tray <b>100</b> may flex to accommodate the fit of different sized jaws. In some embodiments, the outer arcuate wall <b>115</b> and the inner arcuate wall <b>145</b> may comprise shells of a soft plastic, for example, thermoplastic polyurethane, silicone, or a thermoplastic elastomer, providing support for holding the inner surfaces <b>120</b> and <b>125</b>. In some embodiments, the inner surfaces <b>120</b> and <b>125</b> may comprise a material that is firmer than the outer arcuate wall <b>115</b>, for example, a hard plastic (which may be for example, polypropylene, acrylonitrile butadiene styrene, or a polycarbonate plastic). As may be appreciated, the softer material of the outer arcuate wall <b>115</b> and the inner arcuate wall <b>145</b> provide a user comfort since these elements may contact the user&#x2019;s inner cheek surfaces as the brushing elements <b>130</b> engage the user&#x2019;s teeth and gums. In some embodiments, the inner surfaces <b>120</b> and <b>125</b> may be firm providing a solid support structure for detaining the brushing elements <b>130</b> in place during use.</p>
<p id="p-0049" num="0048">Referring now to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>3</b>-<b>8</b></figref>, in some embodiments, the tray assembly <b>100</b> may include a connector <b>140</b> coupled to an exterior surface of the outer arcuate wall <b>115</b>. The connector <b>140</b> may be configured to receive the oscillator mechanism discussed below in more detail. For example, some embodiments may include a mating element <b>142</b> (for example, a female receptacle) which may receive a drive element (described below in reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>9</b>-<b>12</b></figref>) that actuates the tray assembly <b>110</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0050" num="0049">Referring now to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>9</b>-<b>12</b></figref>, the handle assembly <b>150</b> is shown according to an exemplary embodiment. The handle <b>150</b> includes a casing <b>155</b> and a button <b>160</b> which when triggered, activates the actuation of the tray assembly <b>110</b>. The handle <b>150</b> may house an oscillator assembly <b>170</b>. In an exemplary embodiment, the oscillator assembly <b>170</b> includes a shaft <b>172</b> (seen in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>13</b></figref>) protruding from a top end of the casing <b>155</b>. The shaft <b>172</b> may be covered by a sleeve <b>146</b>. The sleeve <b>146</b> may be a male connection configured to slide into the opening in the connector <b>140</b>. A distal end <b>148</b> of the shaft <b>172</b> may be configured to mate with the mating element <b>142</b> in the connector <b>140</b> shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>8</b></figref>. The oscillator assembly <b>170</b> may be configured to move the shaft <b>172</b> side-to-side, which when the shaft <b>172</b> is actuated, drives the tray assembly <b>110</b> to oscillate from one side to the other in a lateral direction.</p>
<p id="p-0051" num="0050">While the above mating configuration was described with the sleeve <b>146</b> attached to the handle <b>150</b>, it should be understood that in other embodiments, the sleeve <b>146</b> may instead be in the connector <b>140</b> and the end <b>148</b> of the shaft <b>172</b> is inserted through the interior of the sleeve <b>146</b> to connect to the mating element <b>142</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0052" num="0051">Referring now to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>13</b>-<b>20</b></figref>, the oscillator assembly <b>170</b> and other driving elements inside the casing <b>155</b> are shown according to an exemplary embodiment. The actuation from the handle <b>150</b> may be driven by a power source <b>192</b> which may be a battery, or a storage cell connected to a wall outlet source for plugged-in embodiments of the system <b>100</b>. The oscillator assembly <b>170</b> may be driven by a motor <b>165</b>. The motor <b>165</b> may include a drive shaft <b>190</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>19</b></figref>) which rotates during operation. The drive shaft <b>190</b> may be coupled to a cam assembly <b>195</b>. The top of the cam assembly <b>195</b> may include a cam <b>185</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>18</b></figref>). The cam <b>185</b> may couple to a proximal end of the shaft <b>172</b>. The cam <b>185</b> may be configured to, when engaged with the shaft <b>172</b>, drive the shaft <b>172</b> in the lateral direction when the motor&#x2019;s drive shaft <b>190</b> rotates the cam assembly <b>195</b>. In some embodiments, the oscillator assembly <b>170</b> may include a sleeve <b>175</b> which houses a section of the shaft <b>172</b>. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>20</b></figref>, in an exemplary embodiment, the cam <b>185</b> may comprise a projection which is received in a pocket of the sleeve <b>175</b>. As the cam <b>185</b> rotates, the projection causes the sleeve <b>175</b> to move laterally following the path of the cam rotation. The shaft <b>172</b> moves laterally with the sleeve <b>175</b>. In some embodiments, the handle <b>150</b> may include one or more guide plates <b>180</b>. The guide plates <b>180</b> may include slots through which the shaft <b>172</b> passes through. The guide plate <b>180</b> slot( s) may include a width that defines a range of movement that limits the travel of the shaft <b>172</b> in the lateral direction. The guide plates <b>180</b> ensure that the shaft <b>172</b> stays within a restricted path of motion. Some embodiments may include a cover <b>194</b> which prevents water from entering the handle and contacting the internal elements.</p>
<p id="p-0053" num="0052">Referring now to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>21</b>-<b>23</b></figref>, an alternative embodiment of the teeth cleaning system is shown with a focus on the connection between a tray and the handle assembly. Certain embodiments may be water resistant with respect to the tray and the handle assembly. Reference numeral <b>200</b> represents a handle assembly <b>200</b> and reference numeral <b>250</b> represents the handle assembly <b>200</b> when it is connected to a tray. Handle assembly <b>200</b> is not connected to a tray in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>21</b>-<b>22</b></figref>. A flexible collar <b>204</b> may be used to protect the handle assembly <b>200</b> from water. The handle assembly <b>200</b> may include a front panel <b>210</b> and a back panel <b>212</b>. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>21</b>-<b>23</b></figref>, the front panel <b>210</b> and the back panel <b>212</b> have recessed edges that fit into the flexible collar <b>204</b> when constructed. The flexible collar <b>204</b> may include an outer rim <b>202</b> at the upper portion of the flexible collar <b>204</b> and a void space <b>222</b> on the inside of the outer rim <b>202</b>. The flexible collar <b>204</b> may also include an upper groove <b>208</b> and a lower groove <b>206</b> to form a tight fit with the corresponding portions of the handle assembly <b>200</b> (front panel <b>210</b>, back panel <b>212</b>). The upper groove <b>208</b> and lower groove <b>206</b> may assist in preventing any water from getting into the handle assembly <b>200</b>. A male connector <b>220</b> from the handle assembly <b>200</b> may be configured to connect to the tray. The inner surface of this void space <b>222</b> of the flexible collar <b>202</b> fits tightly with the male connector <b>220</b> from the handle assembly <b>200</b> to prevent water from entering the handle assembly <b>200</b>. Recessed portions of the male connector <b>220</b> enable connection with the flexible collar <b>204</b>. The upper groove <b>208</b>, the lower groove <b>206</b>, and the inner surface of the void space <b>222</b> assist in preventing water from the tray or from use of the teeth cleaning system to enter the handle assembly <b>200</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0054" num="0053">The flexible collar <b>204</b> may be made out of silicone or TPU for sturdiness, but also flexibility. As discussed herein, the male connector <b>220</b> and the trey may move back and forth in operation. The flexible collar <b>204</b> is designed to flexibly move back and forth with the male connector <b>220</b> and the trey to keep the watertight fit with the handle assembly <b>200</b> and prevent water from entering the handle assembly <b>200</b>. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>23</b></figref> shows how the flexible collar <b>204</b> may move in conjunction with both the male connector <b>220</b> and the connected trey. The void space <b>222</b> is designed to allow this motion of the trey and male connector <b>220</b> within this cavity of the flexible collar <b>204</b>. As the trey moves right and left, the flexible collar <b>204</b> adjusts accordingly without breaking the seal.</p>
<p id="p-0055" num="0054">Referring now to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>24</b>-<b>26</b></figref>, an alternative embodiment of a teeth cleaning system <b>300</b> is shown with a display screen <b>316</b> (a cover for the display screen <b>306</b> is shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>24</b></figref>) on a handle assembly <b>304</b>. While this handle assembly <b>304</b> is shaped differently than handle assembly <b>150</b>, it is designed to control a tray piece <b>302</b> as discussed above. However, the display screen <b>306</b> enables the teeth cleaning system <b>300</b> to provide the user with information, including a timer for brushing, the time of day, the weather outside, and other types of information. One of the most important functions of the display screen <b>306</b> may be to provide the user feedback when he or she is interacting with the device (e.g., directions on teeth cleaning, directions on taking images of the mouth or teeth). An audio speaker (not shown) may be used to provide audio feedback to the user. Connection to an internal network (wifi, cell network) of the user may be used to enable these features. Thus, a transceiver (not shown), which may be located on a printed circuit board (PCB), may be used to enable connection to this internal network or even external networks. Additionally, the cover of a display screen <b>306</b> in conjunction with a hole in the cover for a flash <b>310</b> and a second hole in the cover for a camera <b>308</b> enables the user to take images and video of the teeth, gums, and mouth of the user. A button <b>312</b>, which may be located on either side of the handle assembly <b>304</b> may enable the user to turn on and off the handle assembly <b>304</b> and the corresponding display screen <b>316</b>. An outer case and a cover for the display screen <b>306</b> have been removed in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>26</b></figref> to show the internal components of the handle assembly <b>150</b>. More specifically, a flash <b>318</b> and a camera <b>320</b> provide the ability to take images and videos of the teeth, gums, face, and mouth of the user. A printed circuit board (PCB) <b>322</b> exists underneath the display screen <b>306</b> to house the hardware, firmware, and software necessary for features discussed herein. Two secondary buttons <b>314</b> may exist to control other features of the display screen <b>316</b>, camera <b>320</b>, flash and/or handle assembly <b>304</b>. The hardware, firmware, and software of the teeth cleaning system <b>300</b> enable the features discussed below. Simple images of the user&#x2019;s teeth and gums may be taken by the user for internal analysis by the teeth cleaning system <b>300</b> or for external analysis by external software or dental professionals. The transceiver (not shown) may be used to enable this connection to external software or dental professionals. The transceiver may consist of a transmitter and a receiver for transmitting and receiving data.</p>
<p id="p-0056" num="0055">This camera <b>320</b>, flash <b>318</b>, and hardware/software may provide simple scan or dual scan capabilities according to certain embodiments. A machine learning component may exist on the PCB <b>322</b> to enable automatic capturing of simple scans for routine oral and dental photography. These images may be processed internally by the teeth cleaning system <b>300</b> or may be transmitted to a remote server for analysis by external software and/or dental professionals. A transmitter or transceiver may be used to transmit said data to an external network. A deep scan option may also be available for more in-depth dental imaging. This imaging and processing may enable the detection of dental plaque, tooth decay, gingivitis, periodontitis, gum recession, tooth surface shade, and demineralization. In some embodiments, in-depth dental imaging may also detect misplacement of the teeth, oral cancer, and other health-related symptoms, including exhaustion, depression, pulse, blood pressure, etc. It can be difficult for a user to keep track of his or her dental health and detect inconsistencies when they arise, especially if the user does not or cannot visit a dental professional regularly. These features can offer effortless oral health monitoring on a consistent basis, allowing users to detect any symptoms in the early stages before they evolve into serious health issues. The teeth cleaning device may also include a lift to wake sensor (not shown) that enables the features of the handle assembly <b>200</b> after the user lifts the device. This sensor may be controlled by the hardware, firmware, and software on the PCB.</p>
<p id="p-0057" num="0056">In some embodiments, the hardware and software of the teeth cleaning system <b>300</b> uses machine learning technology to automatically detect a person&#x2019;s face and teeth to make the process of capturing the necessary images less time consuming and cumbersome. An initial scan of the user&#x2019;s teeth, gums, mouth, and face may be necessary to set a baseline for this type of machine learning technology. Data storage may be required to store said images and deep scans of said images. Directions or instructions for taking the scans, images, or videos of the user&#x2019;s teeth and gums may be given by the teeth cleaning device <b>300</b> through a speaker (not shown) or by instructions on the display screen <b>316</b>. The directions may also be given through an app on a user&#x2019;s mobile device that communicates with the teeth cleaning system <b>300</b> through a network. These directions may include commands concerning placement, movement, or handling of the teeth cleaning system <b>300</b> while the images or scans are being taken. More specifically, the directions for the scanning may be sent from an external server or cloud network and may be triggered by the user&#x2019;s input in the app on the user&#x2019;s mobile device. In some embodiments, complex instructions may be required to ensure that the teeth cleaning system <b>300</b> can detect the user&#x2019;s face, smile, and teeth. The images or scans taken by the teeth cleaning system <b>300</b> may be updated or annotated by the user, software, or dental professional in certain embodiments. Segmentation and/or cropping out may also be necessary to process and analyze the user&#x2019;s teeth and gums. A user&#x2019;s interaction with the app on a mobile phone may enable additional features of the teeth cleaning system, including tracking of dental activities, dental appointments, videos of dental care, dental care tips, etc.</p>
<p id="p-0058" num="0057">The flash <b>318</b> may be covered with a type of Fresnel lens to light up the teeth as well as autofocus technology that improves the quality of the images or scans taken of the user&#x2019;s teeth and gums. The camera <b>320</b> may be a 5-mega pixel camera that offers colored images or could also be an IR camera (LiDAR). The hardware and software (at least partially on the PCB <b>322</b>) ensures that the data from the corresponding images or scans may be acquired, processed, and sent to the external server or cloud network according to a secure protocol to protect the user&#x2019;s health data. As discussed above, these images and scans may be part of a broader oral care system where teledentistry is available. The high-resolution images and scans may be accessed and analyzed by a dental professional, which may enable remote diagnostics and treatment. Additionally, the dental professional may utilize the benefit of machine learning technology for assistance in dental treatment as the catalog of dental images may provide a better overall view of the user&#x2019;s dental health. Teledentistry may also be accomplished through the corresponding app on a mobile phone.</p>
