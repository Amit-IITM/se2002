<heading id="h-0001" level="1">CROSS-REFERENCE TO RELATED APPLICATIONS</heading>
<p id="p-0002" num="0001">This application claims the benefit of European Application No. 20177552.5, filed May 29, 2020, and entitled &#x201c;FAT-BASED COMPOSITIONS&#x201d;, which is incorporated by reference herein in its entirety.</p>
<heading id="h-0002" level="1">FIELD OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">The invention relates to a fat-based confectionery composition and to a process for the manufacture of said fat-based confectionery composition. The invention also relates to the use of sucrose having a small particle size distribution D90 and bulking agents for reducing the sugar and/or calories in fat-based confectionery compositions.</p>
<heading id="h-0003" level="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">Fat-based confectionery compositions, such as fillings, coatings, chocolates, and chocolate-like compositions are generally indulgent high sugar and high calorie food products.</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">However, consumers and public health bodies are becoming increasingly concerned about the sugar and fat content of foods and in particular about the sugar content of confectionery products such as chocolate. Sugar has received a lot of negative connotation and many companies &#x26; brands now strive to reduce sugar levels in their complete portfolio to satisfy consumer demand A high sugar diet has been linked to a number of health problems. For example, an excessive consumption of such products may cause obesity, may increase the risk of diabetes and other metabolic diseases and may promote the development of dental caries. Confectionery products comprising less sugar and/or fewer calories, which may be termed &#x2018;light&#x2019; and/or &#x2018;sugar free&#x2019; products, are therefore growing in popularity. Sugar-free confectionery is of course particularly popular with those suffering from diabetes.</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">Accordingly, it would be desirable to provide a fat-based composition having a reduced sugar and/or calorie content, preferably at least 30% sugar reduction by weight. At least a 30% sugar reduction is required in order to claim sugar reduction on the packaging of a food product according to European regulations.</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">However, nutritive sugars, most often sucrose, play a key role in many fat-based confectionery compositions and products. Sucrose provides the familiar and appealing sweetness that consumers expect from such confectionery products. Many previous attempts of confectionery manufacturers to reduce or replace sugar in confectionery products have been unsuccessful, providing an inferior taste and/or texture compared to the &#x201c;full sugar&#x201d; reference products. Therefore, consumer acceptance of such reduced sugar products may be low.</p>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">It is generally known to replace all or some of the sucrose in fat-based confectionery compositions and products with substitutes, such as sugar alcohols (also known as polyols) according to regulatory requirements. Sugar alcohols are less sweet than sucrose, but generally provide fewer calories because they are partially or completely indigestible. Unfortunately, as with many other indigestible substances, overconsumption can lead to gastro-intestinal effects such as bloating, diarrhoea and flatulence. There is thus a recommended upper limit for daily consumption of such sugar alcohols, which must be indicated on the label of the confectionery item. Consumers may furthermore have a bias against products which are labelled as containing &#x201c;artificial sweeteners&#x201d; or contain E numbers in the list of ingredients.</p>
<p id="p-0009" num="0008">Erythritol is a sugar alcohol that is better tolerated than the other sugar alcohols, because it is excreted via the kidneys. It is almost as sweet as sucrose (70% relative sweetness) and has a calorie content of just 0.2 kcal/g. However, erythritol has a high negative heat of solution (&#x2212;180 joules/g) that provides a significant cooling effect in the mouth. This effect works well with mint flavours, e.g. in chewing gums, but can be less desirable in fat-based compositions used for confectionery such as chocolate. Combining erythritol with fibres, such as inulin or FOS, to reduce the cooling effect has been attempted in the past in such applications. Unfortunately, it does not sufficiently overcome the problem of the cooling effect in the mouth and the texture may also be negatively affected. Furthermore, polyols generally have a lower sweetness than sugar, requiring compensation with high intensity sweeteners that may also require an E number listing on the label or that may result in an off-taste or a lingering after-taste, including for instance bitterness.</p>
<p id="p-0010" num="0009">Other attempts to solve the problem of sugar-reduction, include the use of high-intensity sweeteners, which are much sweeter than standard table sugar. However, these ingredients often have a marked bitter off-taste that needs to be masked. Furthermore, high-intensity sweeteners may be able to provide the sweetness of sucrose, however, they are unable to provide the bulk, texture and mouthfeel provided by sucrose. In order to make up for the bulk, an alternative solution is to increase the fat content. However, although this reduces the overall sugar content, an increased fat content will possibly result in an even higher calorie content than the full-sugar reference.</p>
<p id="p-0011" num="0010">To summarize, sugar is not only an ingredient that provides sweetness, it also brings beneficial functionalities to many food products, making sugar reduction very challenging. Many attempts at solutions exist, all with their advantages and disadvantages. The ultimate goal is to provide a solution (or combination of solutions) that does not change the functionality, mouthfeel and sweetness perception of the final fat-based composition.</p>
<heading id="h-0004" level="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0012" num="0011">It is one aim of the present invention, amongst others, to provide a fat-based composition that addresses at least one disadvantage of the prior art, identified herein.</p>
<p id="p-0013" num="0012">For instance, it is one aim of the present invention to provide a fat-based composition, which comprises a reduced amount of sugars and/or calories than the reference full-sugar fat-based composition.</p>
<p id="p-0014" num="0013">For instance, it is also an aim of the present invention to provide a fat-based composition, which comprises a reduced amount of sugars and/or calories than the reference full-sugar chocolate composition, whilst maintaining comparable sweetness and/or creaminess and/or mouthfeel, compared to the reference full-sugar fat-based composition.</p>
<p id="p-0015" num="0014">For instance, it is also an aim of the present invention to provide a simple process to prepare a fat-based composition, which does not require increasing the processing capacity of an existing confectionery line or may even improve the productivity of an existing line without significant capital investment.</p>
<p id="p-0016" num="0015">For instance, it is also an aim of the present invention to provide a process to prepare a fat-based filling more efficiently.</p>
<p id="p-0017" num="0016">According to a first aspect of the present invention, there is thus provided:</p>

<p id="p-0044" num="0057">Preferably, the particulate ingredient is a bulking agent. More preferably, at least one of the particulate ingredients is a bulking agent.</p>
<p id="p-0045" num="0058">More than one bulking agent may be used.</p>
<p id="p-0046" num="0059">Two or more different soluble fibres from the lists below may be used. Two or more different insoluble fibres from the lists below may be used. A combination of both soluble and insoluble fibres may be used.</p>
<p id="p-0047" num="0060">By &#x201c;soluble&#x201d; it is meant predominantly soluble in water.</p>
<p id="p-0048" num="0061">By &#x201c;insoluble&#x201d; it is meant predominantly insoluble in water.</p>
<p id="p-0049" num="0062">1.2.1.1. Soluble Fibre</p>

<p id="p-0051" num="0064">Preferably, the soluble fibre is selected from a resistant dextrin. The term &#x201c;resistant dextrin&#x201d; includes herein soluble corn fibre, soluble wheat fibre, digestion resistant maltodextrin. The resistant dextrin may for example be Nutriose&#xae; from Roquette. The resistant dextrin may for example be Promitor&#xae; Soluble Corn Fibre from Tate &#x26; Lyle.

<p id="p-0055" num="0068">1.2.1.2. Insoluble Fibre</p>
<p id="p-0056" num="0069">Optionally, the particulate ingredient is a bulking agent selected from an insoluble fibre selected from bran such as cereal bran (including wheat bran, rice bran, corn bran, oat bran, barley bran), bamboo fibre, fruit fibre, sugar beet fibre, sugar cane fibre, tomato fibre, coconut fibre, straw from cereals such as wheat or barley, pea fibre, tea, coffee, potato fibre, cocoa, cocoa powder, bran waste, sugar waste, cocoa waste, corn-cob waste, cellulose (including microcrystalline cellulose), hemi-cellulose (for example from elephant grass), chitosan, pectins, gums, mucilages, lignins, native starches, modified starches and combinations of two or more thereof.</p>
<p id="p-0057" num="0070">Moreover, the use of insoluble fibre is a sustainable alternative, as these are often obtained from by-products in the food industry, which can be optionally pre-treated (chemically or physically).</p>
<p id="p-0058" num="0071">Preferably, the insoluble fibre is selected from bran, such as cereal bran, in particular wheat bran or corn bran. The bran can be size-reduced (for instance micronized) down to a particle size distribution D90 of less than 150 &#x3bc;m, preferably less than 100 &#x3bc;m and/or heat-treated. Particle size reduction and the heat treatment can either occur sequentially (in any order) or simultaneously.</p>
<p id="p-0059" num="0072">1.2.2. Nutritive Sweetener</p>
<p id="p-0060" num="0073">Nutritive sweeteners are sugars, such as monosaccharides and disaccharides, and polyols. By &#x201c;nutritive sweeteners&#x201d; it is meant herein sweeteners that provide energy in the form of carbohydrates. They are also known as &#x201c;caloric sweeteners&#x201d;.</p>
<p id="p-0061" num="0074">Preferably, the particulate ingredients comprise at least one bulking agent and at least one nutritive sweetener.</p>
<p id="p-0062" num="0075">More than one nutritive sweetener may be used.</p>
<p id="p-0063" num="0076">1.2.2.1. Monosaccharides</p>
<p id="p-0064" num="0077">Suitable monosaccharides include glucose (also known as dextrose), either in the form of glucose anhydrate or in the form of glucose monohydrate, fructose in crystalline or semi-crystalline form, and any other known monosaccharide, such as galactose, mannose, allulose, ribose, xylose, tagatose etc. and combinations of two or more thereof.</p>
<p id="p-0065" num="0078">The glucose and/or fructose can also be in the form of dried glucose and/or fructose syrups having a DE of from 20 to 40. Glucose and/or fructose syrups can also be prepared by the controlled acid or enzymatic hydrolysis of starch, for instance corn starch.</p>
<p id="p-0066" num="0079">1.2.2.2. Disaccharides</p>
<p id="p-0067" num="0080">Suitable disaccharides include sucrose (also known colloquially as sugar or table sugar or standard table sugar), maltose, lactose, lactulose, trehalose, cellobiose, isomaltulose, and a combination of two or more thereof.</p>
<p id="p-0068" num="0081">The term &#x201c;sucrose&#x201d; as used herein includes sucrose in various forms including but not limited to standard (e.g. granulated) table sugar, powder sugar, pearl sugar, soft white sugar, caster sugar, icing sugar, sugar syrup, silk sugar, unrefined sugar, crystal sugar, fine sugar, ultrafine sugar. The sucrose can be obtained from sugar cane, sugar beet, sugar maple sap, date palm, sorghum. The sucrose can also be in the form of raw or unrefined or whole cane sugar, or brown sugar or molasses.</p>
<p id="p-0069" num="0082">Preferably, the mixture in step (a) comprises at least one particulate ingredient comprising, essentially consisting of or consisting of sucrose.</p>
<p id="p-0070" num="0083">1.2.2.3. Polyols</p>
<p id="p-0071" num="0084">Polyols include, for example, erythritol, mannitol, maltitol, sorbitol, xylitol, isomalt, lactitol, and a combination of two or more thereof.</p>
<p id="p-0072" num="0085">Preferably, the fat-based composition according to the invention is substantially free of polyols.</p>
<p id="p-0073" num="0086">1.2.3. Non-Nutritive Sweeteners</p>
<p id="p-0074" num="0087">The particulate ingredients can include non-nutritive sweeteners. By &#x201c;non-nutritive sweeteners&#x201d; it is meant herein sweeteners that generally do not provide caloric energy, but do provide a sweet taste. They are also known as &#x201c;non-caloric sweeteners&#x201d;.</p>
<p id="p-0075" num="0088">Non-nutritive sweeteners include, for example, high intensity sweeteners.</p>
<p id="p-0076" num="0089">High intensity sweeteners include aspartame, advantame, acesulfame salts such as acesulfame-k, cyclamates, saccharin, sucralose, neohesperidin dihydrochalon, alitame, neotame, stevia, stevia-leaf extracts, glycosides such as steviosides or rebaudiosides e.g. rebaudioside A or M, mogrosides (and other sweeteners found in monk fruit), glycyrrhizin, monellin, thaumatin, brazzein, or any combination of two or more thereof.</p>
<p id="p-0077" num="0090">Preferably, if present, the high intensity sweetener is stevia, a stevia leaf extract or a glycoside e.g. rebaudioside A or M.</p>
<p id="p-0078" num="0091">Preferably, the fat-based composition according to the invention is substantially free of high-intensity sweeteners.</p>
<p id="p-0079" num="0092">1.2.4. Dairy-Based Powders</p>
<p id="p-0080" num="0093">The dairy-based powders are preferably selected from but not limited to skimmed milk powder, full fat milk powder, caramelized milk powder, (sweet) whey powder, lactose, skimmed yoghurt powder, full fat yoghurt powder, cream powder and combinations of two or more thereof.</p>
<p id="p-0081" num="0094">1.3. Powder Ingredient(s)</p>
<p id="p-0082" num="0095">The powder ingredient(s) to be added after the refining step to the refined mixture are selected from bulking agents and nutritive sweeteners as listed under Sections 1.2.1. and 1.2.2. respectively, and combinations of two or more thereof.</p>
<p id="p-0083" num="0096">The powder ingredient(s) may also comprise or essentially consist of the dry-blends disclosed in EP20161754.5 and the dried and recrystallised blends (which are then size-reduced to the required D90) disclosed in EP20161793.3.</p>
<p id="p-0084" num="0097">The choice of powder ingredient(s) will depend on the desired type of end composition. For instance, a sugar free fat-based composition will preferably comprise a bulking agent and/or polyol as at least one of the powder ingredients. However, for a reduced sugar fat-based composition, the powder ingredient(s) will preferably comprise sucrose.</p>
<p id="p-0085" num="0098">The difference between the powder ingredient(s) in step (c) and the particulate ingredient(s) in step (a) is the particle size. The powder ingredient(s) must have a particle size distribution D90 of at most 30 &#x3bc;m, preferably at most 25 &#x3bc;m, more preferably at most 20 &#x3bc;m. Optionally, the powder ingredient(s) also has a particle size distribution D50 of at most 10 &#x3bc;m, preferably at most 9 &#x3bc;m, more preferably at most 8 &#x3bc;m. The lower limit of the particle size distribution D90 is greater than zero, but may be negligible depending on the limit of detection of the equipment used to measure the particle size.</p>
<p id="p-0086" num="0099">If more than one powder ingredient is being used, all powder ingredients must have a particle size distribution D90 of at most 30 &#x3bc;m, preferably at most 25 &#x3bc;m, preferably at most 20 &#x3bc;m.</p>
<p id="p-0087" num="0100">Preferably, the powder ingredient(s) comprises, essentially consists of, or consists of sucrose having a particle size distribution D90 of at most 30 &#x3bc;m, preferably at most 25 &#x3bc;m, preferably at most 20 &#x3bc;m. Optionally, the sucrose has a particle size distribution D50 of at most 10 &#x3bc;m, preferably at most 9 &#x3bc;m, more preferably at most 8 &#x3bc;m. The sucrose can thus be a size-reduced powder sugar, fine sugar, refined sugar, ultrafine sugar, silk sugar etc.</p>
<p id="p-0088" num="0101">Advantageously, the powder ingredient(s) comprises, essentially consists of, or consists of silk sugar, such as the silk sugar manufactured by British Sugar Plc. Silk sugar is a sugar preferably having a particle size distribution D90 of at most 30 &#x3bc;m, or at most 25 &#x3bc;m, or at most 20 &#x3bc;m. Silk sugar may have a D50 particle size of at most 15 &#x3bc;m, or at most 10 &#x3bc;m, or at most 9 &#x3bc;m, or at most 8 &#x3bc;m. More preferably, silk sugar has a D90 particle size of 20 &#x3bc;m and a D50 particle size of 8 &#x3bc;m.</p>
<p id="p-0089" num="0102">Without being bound by theory, according to the prior art method, it is thought that by adding standard table sugar, which has a D90 of about 1000 &#x3bc;m, and optionally other particulate ingredients, such as bulking agents (e.g. soluble or insoluble fibres), to the mixture in step (a) and then refining it down together with the fat to a D90 of less than 35 um, preferably less than 30 um, the sucrose becomes very embedded in the food matrix and interacts substantially with the other ingredients. Hence, despite the small particle size after refining, the sugar is not readily accessible by the taste receptors in the mouth. Thus, dissolution and sweetness perception in the mouth is limited. Despite the use of bulking agents to partially replace some of the sugar, a fat-based composition according to the prior art, the same level of sweetness as the full-sugar reference cannot be achieved without adding further non-nutritive sweeteners.</p>
<p id="p-0090" num="0103">Without being bound by theory, the inventors of the current method and fat-based composition according to the invention, have surprisingly found that by adding a powder ingredient(s) with a relatively small particle size, preferably comprising, essentially consisting of, or consisting of sucrose, to an already refined mixture, the powder ingredient(s) are then in fact less embedded in the food matrix. Is it thought that the powder ingredient(s), although homogeneously dispersed in the refined mixture, can dissolve surprisingly more quickly in the oral cavity by being added after the refining step. This rapid dissolution leads to an enhanced perception of sweetness, because it means that more of the sweetener composition is tasted by the tongue before being swallowed. Thus, less sugar and powder ingredient(s) are needed to achieve the same or comparable level of sweetness.</p>
<p id="p-0091" num="0104">Thus, the powder ingredient(s), preferably comprising, essentially consisting of, or consisting of sucrose, can be used to boost the sweetness of a food product together with a bulking agent. More bulking agent can be used to replace the overall sucrose content without significantly affecting taste and texture.</p>
<p id="p-0092" num="0105">The relatively small particle size also provides good mouthfeel to the final product as the composition will not be perceived as gritty or grainy or gummy in texture. An additional surprising advantage of the invention, is that it has been observed that the composition becomes much creamier when using powder ingredient(s), preferably comprising, essentially consisting of, or consisting of sucrose, after refining, than by adding the same ingredient with a bigger particle size (as a particulate ingredient) before refining. Again, without being bound by theory, it is thought that this is a surprising result of the powders being less embedded and linked to the other ingredients, in particular the fat.</p>
<p id="p-0093" num="0106">Furthermore, without being bound by theory, it can be assumed that a very fine nutritive sweetener or bulking agent would interact with the fat differently than a coarse nutritive sweetener/bulking agent that then needs to be refined. Fat is an important ingredient in the composition, known for its ability to crystallize. We would assume that the granulometry of the sugar would influence the crystallization of the fat. Thus, adding the very fine nutritive sweetener/bulking agent at the end of the process is thought to positively affect the inherent structure of the fat, allowing for the creamier texture.</p>
<p id="p-0094" num="0107">1.3.1. Particle Size and Particle Size Reduction</p>
<p id="p-0095" num="0108">According to the present invention particle size, i.e. granulometry, is defined using D90. The D90 value is a common method of describing a particle size distribution. &#x201c;D90&#x201d; refers to is the volume diameter where 90% of the volume distribution of the particles is below this value. In other words, in a cumulative distribution of the maximum particle dimension in a sample of particles, 90% of the distribution lies below the D90 value. &#x201c;D50&#x201d; refers to the value of the maximum particle dimension (for example, the diameter for a generally spherical particle) where 50% of the volume of the particles in the sample have a maximum particle dimension below that value. In other words, in a cumulative distribution of the maximum particle dimension in a sample of particles, 50% of the distribution lies below the D50 value.</p>
<p id="p-0096" num="0109">&#x201c;Maximum dimension&#x201d; or &#x201c;maximum particle dimension&#x201d; refers to the longest cross-sectional dimension of any particular particle, e.g. a carbohydrate crystal, a particle of bulking agent, or particle of the final sweetener composition.</p>
<p id="p-0097" num="0110">The particle size distribution values, such as D90 or D50, may be measured for example by a laser light diffraction/scattering particle size analyzer as described further below. Other known measurement techniques for particle size may also be used depending on the nature of the sample. The particle size distribution values, such as D90 or D50, of powders may conveniently be measured by digital image analysis (such as using a CAMSIZER XT&#xae; as sold by Retsh GmbH) while the particle size distribution values, such as D90 or D50, of particles comprised within a fat-based composition may be measured by laser light scattering. Particle size may be measured using any known method using suitable equipment. One device that is commonly used is a Malvern Mastersizer 3000 as sold by Malvern Panalytical Ltd.</p>
<p id="p-0098" num="0111">Any particle size reduction technique that is known in the art may be used to obtain powder ingredient(s) suitable for the present invention, such as milling, micronization, grinding, extrusion, high pressure homogenization, abrasion, fractionation, or pulverizing. A combination of particle size reduction techniques may also be used.</p>
<p id="p-0099" num="0112">Any known milling method may be used. For example, ball-milling, wet-ball milling, or micro-milling in an impact mill.</p>
<p id="p-0100" num="0113">Micronization may be used to provide very fine particles (e.g. less than 100 microns). Micronization methods are known in the industry. For example, WO2017/167965, which is incorporated herein by reference, describes a micronized material. Micronization involves heat-treating the material and then milling at high speed (e.g. at least 3000 rpm) using a high performance mill, such as a cell mill or jet mill.</p>
<p id="p-0101" num="0114">A cell mill is a highly efficient mechanical mill with multiple rotors mounted on a vertical shaft. Product quality is optimised by control of mill speed through a frequency inverter, which also limits the starting current. A cell mill results in two product streams, standard (or product) and oversize, the standard stream is the preferred output.</p>
<p id="p-0102" num="0115">A jet mill (also known as a microniser) typically comprises a spiral jet which uses compressed gas to produce superfine materials by autogenous comminution. Feed material is inspirated by a small proportion of the compressed gas through a venturi into the grinding chamber where numerous angles nozzles accelerate the material into particle-particle impact. There are no moving parts in the mill and no mechanical forces are applied to the grinding process. Variation in gas pressure and residence time is possible.</p>
<p id="p-0103" num="0116">The particle size reduction technique may be cryogenic. Cryogenic techniques are particularly useful where there is a need to control or reduce the stickiness of the particles.</p>
<p id="p-0104" num="0117">The particle size reduction technique may also include size classification and/or separation steps (e.g. sieving or sifting). For example, a TTC/TTD Air Classifier&#xae; or Mikro&#xae; Acucut Air classifier model sold by Hosokawa Micron Powder Systems may be used.</p>
<p id="p-0105" num="0118">1.4. Emulsifiers</p>
<p id="p-0106" num="0119">The fat-based composition of the present invention may further comprise one or more emulsifier(s). The most commonly used emulsifier is lecithin. Suitable emulsifiers include lecithin derived from either soya bean, safflower, sunflower or corn; fractionated lecithins enriched with either phosphatidyl choline, phosphatidyl ethanolamine, phosphatidyl inositol; emulsifiers derived from oats, mono and diglycerides and their tartaric esters, monosodium phosphate derivatives of mono- and diglycerides of edible fats and oils, sorbitan monostearate, sorbitan tristearate, sucrose esters, polyoxyethylene sorbitan monostearate, hydroxylated lecithin, synthetic phospholipids such as ammonium phosphatides, lactylated fatty acid esters of glycerol and propylene glycol, polyglycerol esters of fatty acids, propylene glycol mono- and diesters of fats and fatty acids.</p>
<p id="p-0107" num="0120">Other emulsifiers include polyglycerol polyricinoleate (PGPR), polyglycerol ester (PGE), whey proteins, milk proteins, sodium caseinate, lysolecithin, fatty acid salts, lysozyme, sodium stearoyl lactylate, calcium stearoyl lactylate, lauroyl arginate, sucrose monooleate, sucrose monostearate, sucrose monopalmitate, sucrose monolaurate, sucrose distearate, sorbitan monooleate, sorbitan monostearate, sorbitan monopalmitate, sorbitan monolaurate, and sorbitan tristearate.</p>
<p id="p-0108" num="0121">It is preferred to use at least one or more of (fractionated) lecithin, polyglycerol polyricinoleate (PGPR), ammonium phosphatide, and mono- and diglycerides as the emulsifier.</p>
<p id="p-0109" num="0122">Optionally, the emulsifier is added after the refining step (b) of the method according to the invention. The emulsifier can be added together with fat or separately. This can occur before, during or after step (d).</p>
<p id="p-0110" num="0123">Optionally, a part or all of the emulsifier is included in the mixture of step (a) and any remaining amount of the emulsifier is added after the refining step (b) of the method according to the invention, either before, during or after step (c) and/or step (d). The emulsifier can be added together with fat or separately.</p>
<p id="p-0111" num="0124">1.5. Other Optional Ingredients: Cocoa Solids, Milk Chocolate Crumb, Flavours, Colours, Texturizers, Proteins and Other Additives</p>
<p id="p-0112" num="0125">The fat-based composition of the present invention may further comprise other optional ingredients, such as cocoa solids, flavours, colours, texturizers, proteins, additives and combinations of two or more thereof.</p>
<p id="p-0113" num="0126">The cocoa solids are selected from one or more of cocoa powder (including natural cocoa powder, alkalized cocoa powder, and fat-reduced cocoa powder), cocoa liquor (in the form of a paste comprising cocoa-based solids and fats) and combinations of two or more thereof. If cocoa solids are present, optionally, the method further comprises a step (b&#x2032;) of conching the mixture after step (b) and prior to step (c); and optionally a step (e) of solidifying the mixed refined mixture to obtain a chocolate or chocolate-like composition. During the conching step (b&#x2032;) an additional amount of fat can be added, preferably to liquify the mixture.</p>
<p id="p-0114" num="0127">The fat-based composition may also comprise a milk crumb or milk chocolate crumb. Milk chocolate crumb is a vacuum dried, crystallized mixture made from milk, sugar and cocoa liquor. If there is no cocoa liquor in it, it is called milk crumb or blokmilk.

<p id="p-0120" num="0133">2.1. Step a) Providing a Mixture</p>
<p id="p-0121" num="0134">The mixture is prepared by thoroughly mixing the particulate ingredient(s) and at least a part of the fat and to obtain a homogeneous mixture.</p>
<p id="p-0122" num="0135">Any mixer known in the art for preparing pre-refined fat-based mixtures can be used e.g. planetary mixers or Z blade mixers. The mixture is a suspension i.e. a dispersion of the particulate ingredient(s) in the fat matrix.</p>
<p id="p-0123" num="0136">Preferably, mixing is carried out a temperature at least &#x3e;5&#xb0; C., preferably at least &#x3e;10&#xb0; C. higher than the melting point of the mixture e.g. for instance at about 50&#xb0; C.</p>
<p id="p-0124" num="0137">Mixing can be carried out preferably for a period of from 10 to 30 minutes, more preferably from 10 to 15 min, or simply until homogeneous. The shear rate will depend on the type of mixing equipment used and will be shear rate commonly used in the art.</p>
<p id="p-0125" num="0138">The fat and particulate ingredient(s) respectively may be present in the mixture of step (a) in an amount by weight according to the ratio of fat:particulate ingredient(s) of 99:1, or 98:2, or 97:3, or 96:4, or 95:5, or 90:10, or 85:15, or 80:20, or 75:25, or 70:30, or 65:35, or 60:30, or 55:45, or 50:50, or 45:55, or 40:60, or 35:65, or 30:60, or 25:75, or 20:80, or 15:85, or 10:90, or 5:95, or 4:96, or 3:97, or 2:98, or 1:99. The fat and particulate ingredient(s) may also be present in the sweetener composition in an amount by weight within a range formed by a combination of the end points from any two of the above list of ratios.</p>
<p id="p-0126" num="0139">The ratio of fat to particulate ingredient will depend on the type of fat-based composition being prepared and the type and amount of particulate ingredient included in step (a).</p>
<p id="p-0127" num="0140">Preferably, for fillings, coatings, dips, spreads, enrobing compositions: the ratio of fat to particulate ingredient(s) can be from 60:40 to 40:60, preferably from 50:50 to 55:45.</p>
<p id="p-0128" num="0141">Preferably, for chocolate and chocolate-like compositions: the ratio of fat to particulate ingredient(s) can be from 25:75 to 40:60, preferably from 30:70 to 35:65.</p>
<p id="p-0129" num="0142">The fat may be present in the mixture in an amount of 99%, 98%, 97%, 96%, 95%, 90%, 85%, 80%, 75%, 70%, 65%, 60%, 55%, 50%, 45%, 40%, 35%, 30%, 25%, 20%, 15%, 10%, 5%, 4%, 3%, 2%, or 1% by weight. The fat may also be present in the mixture in an amount by weight within a range formed by a combination of any two values from the above list of percentages. Preferably, the fat is present in the mixture in an amount sufficient to provide a continuous fat phase in which the particulate ingredient(s) can be dispersed.</p>
<p id="p-0130" num="0143">Optionally, only a part of the fat of the fat-based composition is provided in the mixture of step (a). The remainder of the fat can be added after the refining step either before, during or after step (c) and/or (d). In this case, at least 1%, at least 5%, at least 10%, at least 20%, at least 30%, at least 40%, at least 50%, at least 60%, at least 70%, at least 80%, at least 90%, at least 95%, at least 99% in an amount by weight of fat of the fat-based composition is provided in the mixture of step (a).</p>

Preferably, the bulking agent(s) is present in the mixture in an amount sufficient to provide a bulking effect.</p>
<p id="p-0133" num="0146">2.2. Step b) Refining</p>
<p id="p-0134" num="0147">The term &#x201c;refining&#x201d;, as used herein in relation to all aspects of the invention, will be well-known to those skilled in the art and refers to a step of particle size reduction. The term &#x201c;refining&#x201d; may be synonymous with milling.</p>
<p id="p-0135" num="0148">The refining step is selected from roll-refining, ball-refining, knife-refining, dry-grinding and micronizing.</p>
<p id="p-0136" num="0149">The refining step may be carried out using a ball mill or roll refiner, preferably a roll refiner, more preferably a 5 roll refiner.</p>
<p id="p-0137" num="0150">Standard conditions known in the art and by the skilled person can be used.</p>
<p id="p-0138" num="0151">The mixture from step (a) is refined to a particle size distribution D90 of less than 40 &#x3bc;m, preferably less than 35 &#x3bc;m, more preferably less than 30 &#x3bc;m. Section 1.3.1 regarding particle size distribution applies.</p>
<p id="p-0139" num="0152">The skilled person will know how much fat needs to be added in order to refine the mixture.</p>
<p id="p-0140" num="0153">2.3. Step c) Adding Powder Ingredient</p>
<p id="p-0141" num="0154">After the refining step, the powder ingredient(s) are added to the refined mixture. This is preferably done with the temperature of the refined mixture at at least &#x3e;5&#xb0; C., preferably at least 10&#xb0; C. above the melting temperature of the refined mixture. Most preferably, the powder ingredient(s) should be added as late as possible in the process i.e. after refining and even after the addition of any additional fat and/or emulsifier(s) after refining.</p>
<p id="p-0142" num="0155">An amount of 99%, 98%, 97%, 96%, 95%, 90%, 85%, 80%, 75%, 70%, 65%, 60%, 55%, 50%, 45%, 40%, 35%, 30%, 25%, 20%, 15%, 10%, 5%, 4%, 3%, 2%, or 1% by weight of powder ingredient(s) (based on the total weight of the fat-based composition) may be added to the refined mixture. The powder ingredient(s) may also be added in an amount by weight (based on the total weight of the fat-based composition) within a range formed by a combination of any two values from the above list of percentages. Preferably, the at least one powder ingredient is added to the refined mixture in an amount sufficient to provide an enhanced sweetening effect. Preferably, the powder ingredient(s) comprises, essentially consists of, or consists of sucrose.</p>
<p id="p-0143" num="0156">Without being bound to theory, it is thought that adding powder ingredients having a very small particle size after the refining step, means that the powder ingredients interact less with the other ingredients in the fat-based composition. Hence, their sensory functionalities are more accessible upon consumption of the composition. For example, if the powder ingredient is a nutritive sweetener, such as sucrose and particular a sucrose such as silk sugar having a D90 of about 20 &#x3bc;m or less (and optionally a D50 of about 10 &#x3bc;m or less), the perceived sweetness and creaminess of the composition is increased, even when using 30% less sucrose overall, compared to the full-sugar reference fat-based composition. The bulking properties of the sucrose can be achieved by replacing part of the sugar with a bulking agent, such as a soluble fibre, in particular a resistant dextrin. The bulking agent can be added prior to refining as one of the particulate ingredients.</p>
<p id="p-0144" num="0157">Optionally, only a part of the fat of the fat-based composition is provided in the mixture of step (a) and the remainder of the fat can be added after the refining step, either with, before or after the addition of the powder ingredient(s). In this case, at most 1%, at most 5%, at most 10%, at most 20%, at most 30%, at most 40%, at most 50%, at most 60%, at most 70%, at most 80%, at most 90%, at most 95%, at least 99% in an amount by weight of fat of the fat-based composition is added to the refined mixture.</p>
<p id="p-0145" num="0158">2.4. Step d) Mixing</p>
<p id="p-0146" num="0159">The refined mixture and the powder ingredient(s) are then thoroughly mixed to obtain a homogenous fat-based composition.</p>
<p id="p-0147" num="0160">According to the present invention, mixing may be carried out by means of any suitable equipment known in the art. A non-exhaustive list of types of devices that can be used may include ribbon mixers, paddle mixers, vertical mixers, tumble mixers, and thermal screws. Mixing may be carried out under low, medium, or high shear, and is carried out for an amount of time sufficient to obtain a homogeneous composition.</p>
<p id="p-0148" num="0161">The method according to the invention is thus suitable for preparing a sugar-reduced fat-based composition. By &#x201c;sugar-reduced&#x201d; it is not meant that sugar present in a composition is physically removed from the composition. It is meant that compared to a reference full-sugar fat-based composition, the method according to the present invention results in a fat-based composition that comprises less overall sugar.</p>

In particular, the method of the invention may be used to wholly or partially replace the sugar in a recipe for a food product (i.e. it may be used as a &#x201c;sugar replacer&#x201d;). The term &#x201c;replace&#x201d; is not intended to be construed such that sugar must be removed from a food product before adding the particulate and powder ingredients according to the invention, rather it is meant that the inventive method is used to add less sugar that would otherwise be used when manufacturing the full-sugar reference food product. When used as a sugar replacer, the method of the invention may be used to replace up to 10%, or up to 20%, or up to 30%, or up to 40%, or up to 50%, or up to 60%, or up to 70%, or up to 80%, or up to 90%, or up to 100% of the sugar in the food product by weight.

<p id="p-0179" num="0202">The fat-based composition may comprise a cocoa butter replacer (CBR) (sometimes known as a cocoa butter substitute (CBS)) in place of some or all of the cocoa butter. Such compositions are sometimes known as compound chocolate or chocolate-like compositions, which may be used as coatings, fillings etc. Suitable CBR's include CBR laurics and CBR nonlaurics. CBR laurics are short-chain fatty acid glycerides. Their physical properties vary within the group but they all have triglyceride configurations that make them compatible with cocoa butter. Suitable CBR's include those based on palm kernel oil and coconut oil. CBR non-laurics consist of fractions obtained from hydrogenated oils. The oils are electively partially or fully hydrogenated with the formation of trans acids, which increases the solid phase of the fat. Suitable sources for CBR nonlaurics include soya, cottonseed, peanut, rapeseed and corn (maize) oil.</p>
<p id="p-0180" num="0203">The fat-based composition may comprise at least one vegetable fat that is liquid at standard ambient temperature and pressure ((SATP, 25&#xb0; C. and 100 kPa).

        <li id="ul0014-0002" num="0219">A typical commercial milk chocolate will normally comprise cocoa solids, fat, dairy-based (or plant-based dairy alternative) powder, sugar and emulsifier, optionally wherein some of the fat can be dairy fat;</li>
        <li id="ul0014-0003" num="0220">A typical commercial white chocolate will normally comprise dairy-based powder, fat, sugar and emulsifier. White chocolate is prepared without the addition of cocoa mass or cocoa powder.</li>
    </ul>
    </li>
</ul>
</p>
<p id="p-0195" num="0221">A chocolate or chocolate-like composition preferably has a fat content of from at least 15%, at least 20%, at least 25%, or at least 30% and up to at most 85%, at most 70%, at most 60%, or at most 50%.</p>
<p id="p-0196" num="0000">Additional Step b&#x2032;) Conching</p>
<p id="p-0197" num="0222">The term &#x201c;conching&#x201d;, as used herein, will be understood by those skilled in the art and refers to a flavour-developing step which involves the intimate mixing or kneading of the chocolate ingredients, typically at elevated temperatures. Conching is preferably carried out prior to addition of the powder ingredient(s) i.e. step (c).</p>
<heading id="h-0010" level="2">Optional Step e) Solidifying</heading>
<p id="p-0198" num="0223">In order to obtain an ambient chocolate or chocolate-like composition i.e. which is solid at room temperature (20-25&#xb0; C.), a final step is applied to solidify the chocolate or chocolate-like composition. The solidification of chocolate and chocolate-like compositions is also called &#x201c;tempering&#x201d;.</p>
<heading id="h-0011" level="2">4. Uses of the Invention</heading>
<p id="p-0199" num="0224">The invention also covers the use of at least one powder ingredient, preferably comprising, essentially consisting of or consisting of at least one nutritive sweetener, having a particle size distribution D90 of less than 30 &#x3bc;m, preferably less than 20 &#x3bc;m, and at least one particulate ingredient, preferably comprising, essentially consisting of or consisting of at least one bulking agent, in the manufacture of a food product for reducing the sugar and/or calorie content of the full-sugar reference food product. The nutritive sweetener is preferably a disaccharide, more preferably sucrose. The bulking agent is preferably a soluble fibre, more preferably resistant dextrin. Optionally, the use includes maintaining comparable sweetness and/or mouthfeel of the full-sugar reference food product.</p>
<p id="p-0200" num="0225">Optionally, the use includes maintaining comparable sweetness and/or mouthfeel in comparison to the full-sugar reference food product.</p>
<p id="p-0201" num="0226">The invention also covers the use of the fat-based composition according to the invention for reducing the sugar and/or calorie content of a full-sugar reference food product, whilst preferably maintaining comparable sweetness and/or mouthfeel of said full-sugar reference food product.</p>
<p id="p-0202" num="0227">The invention also covers a food product comprising the fat-based composition according the invention and other ingredients, wherein the food product is preferably selected from the group consisting of frozen and non-frozen confectionery (chocolate confectionery, sugar confectionery and the like), baked goods (pastries, cakes and the like), biscuits and wafers, and dairy products.</p>
<p id="p-0203" num="0228">The present invention allows to prepare a fat-based filling more efficiently, since the powder ingredient is added after the refining steps, reducing the dry substance of the initial mixture. Thus, the refining step may be carried out with less energy input.</p>

<p id="p-0228" num="0262">In a first step, dry ingredients are weighed out and mixed. A partial amount of the total fat is added. To avoid a sandy mouthfeel in fat-based confectionery products, the particle size of the mixture needs to be reduced down to a D90 of not more than 35 &#x3bc;m by a method known as refining. Roll-refining of the mixture was carried out on a Buhler SDY-200. For these trials a particle size distribution D90 of 25-30 &#x3bc;m was targeted. Particle size was measure with a micrometer as described in the description above.</p>
<p id="p-0229" num="0263">In the last step, the remaining powder ingredients are added and mixed for 15 minutes at speed 3 (see <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>).</p>
<p id="p-0230" num="0264">For full evaluation of ingredient performance, the dosing order of the raw material was varied using two different methods:

        <li id="ul0026-0002" num="0266">Method 2: This is the method according to the invention. Particulate ingredients were added in step 1 i.e. soluble fibre (resistant dextrin) and the milk powders were mixed with a partial amount of the total fat.</li>
    </ul>
    </li>
</ul>
</p>
<p id="p-0231" num="0267">The mixture was refined. The remaining fat was then added and mixed. Finally, the silk sugar and emulsifier were added in step 4 and mixed. This method was applied for the RECIPE R2.</p>
<p id="p-0232" num="0268">Prior to division in small portions the white fat-based fillings were stored at 50&#xb0; C. 20 g of sample was put in a sample container and then cooled in order to induce crystallization for 30 min at 12&#xb0; C.

<p id="p-0240" num="0282">Differences are clearly visible. RECIPE R1, which represents a known method of sugar reduction, partially replaces standard sugar with a bulking agent prior to the refining step. However, this RECIPE R1 performs much worse than the REFERENCE RECIPE. In particular, the sweetness perception is much reduced.</p>
<p id="p-0241" num="0283">RECIPE R2 according to the invention clearly ranks higher than RECIPE R1, even though both have the same sugar reduction of 30%. This shows that the method and the particle size of the sucrose play an important role in the sweetness perception and texture of the final product. The REFERENCE RECIPE and RECIPE R2 have comparable scores on sweetness perception, milk taste and off taste. Surprisingly, RECIPE R2 scores even better on creaminess than the REFERENCE RECIPE. This is an added advantage. Normally, the fat content would need to be increased in order to improve on the creaminess of a fat-based filling.</p>
