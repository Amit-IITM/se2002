<p id="p-0003" num="0002">The present disclosure relates generally to insect guards for use in devices and systems for aspirated smoke, gas, or air quality monitoring.</p>
<heading id="h-0003" level="1">BACKGROUND</heading>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">Some smoke detection systems have a number of sample points spaced around a building that are connected via sampling tubes to a remotely located single central detector apparatus that samples air taken from the sample points to determine if smoke, harmful chemicals, or a fire is present in an area of the building. For example, such systems may be referred to as very early smoke detection apparatus (VESDA) systems.</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">In some jurisdictions, it is a requirement of fire standards that smoke detection systems be fitted with an insect guard in which a mesh is used to prevent entry of large insects which may trigger a false alarm if the insect reaches the smoke detection chamber. In such implementations, the insect guard aperture size is specified by the applicable fire standards.</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">Although used for this purpose, meshes readily accumulate dust, lint, and other particulate and, therefore, impede the entry of smoke and other harmful particles into the detection unit. This is especially true of meshes placed in the air flow path of aspirated smoke detection systems, which is almost always where they will be placed to keep insects out of the unit.</p>

<heading id="h-0005" level="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION</heading>
<p id="p-0012" num="0011">Devices, methods, and systems having insect guards in devices and systems for aspirated smoke, gas, or air quality monitoring are described herein. One aspirated smoke, gas, or air quality monitoring unit includes a detector module that includes at least one particulate sensing chamber within the detector module and an air inlet connecting the sampling tube to the particulate sensing chamber allowing communication of air from the sampling tube to the particulate sensing chamber; and a spiral shaped insect guard positioned within the inlet. Embodiments of the present disclosure use tubes to sample air, smoke, and/or gas from locations in a building that are remotely located from a central detector module (air quality monitoring unit).</p>
<p id="p-0013" num="0012">An insect guard structure is proposed in the present disclosure that uses a wire element formed into a spiral form, by coiling it within a plane such that the wire coils around itself creating a larger coil in each revolution around a reference point at the center of the spiral. In the embodiments of the present disclosure, the gap between adjacent outside surfaces of two adjacent coils is no more than that permitted by an applicable government standard, such as UL Standard 268, 7<sup>th </sup>edition. Section 7.2.</p>
<p id="p-0014" num="0013">An alternate form is the wire element formed in a zig-zag pattern where the gap between adjacent layers is no more than the permitted standard.</p>
<p id="p-0015" num="0014">The advantage of these structures is that the relative aperture area compared to the overall area is high, compared with mesh, allowing less impedance to air flow and, therefore, less accumulation of airborne dust.</p>
<p id="p-0016" num="0015">The types of wire used to create the spiral can be of different cross sections and can offer different characteristics of air flow rate, turbulence generation, and/or dust accumulation, among other characteristics. For example, the wire can be a circular, ellipsoidal, or tear drop shape. Cross sectional shapes can also be polygons, such as triangles, rectangles, rhombuses, other parallelograms, trapeziums, trapezoids, and the like.</p>
<p id="p-0017" num="0016">In one implementation, a rectangular cross section wire element version used in aspirated systems, can have its windward edge tapered, creating a trapezium shape in order to reduce the windward edge surface and to reduce aerodynamic resistance and turbulence further reducing the propensity to collect dust from the air flow. This design is desirable as creation of the shape is relatively easy from a manufacturing standpoint as the wire can be tapered before the coiling process to create the spiral is implemented. A similar functional effect can also be accomplished with ellipsoidal cross section and tear drop cross section wire elements as will be discussed in more detail below with respect to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>5</b>A-<b>5</b>E</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0018" num="0017">This insect guard is a product differentiator for air detection systems as it meets regulatory requirements while reducing or minimizing resistance to air flow or air movement and reducing the likelihood of blockage due to contamination of the guard. A spiral insect guard, which may be made of plastic, metal, or other solid material, is placed in such a way that air containing smoke must pass through it before entering the region where smoke may be detected. The distance of the spacing between the turns of the spiral is set so that insects are prevented from entering the smoke detection area and potentially triggering a false alarm. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref> shows an implementation of an air monitoring system having an insect guard.</p>
<p id="p-0019" num="0018">In the following detailed description, reference is made to the accompanying drawings that form a part hereof. The drawings show by way of illustration how one or more embodiments of the disclosure may be practiced.</p>
<p id="p-0020" num="0019">These embodiments are described in sufficient detail to enable those of ordinary skill in the art to practice one or more embodiments of this disclosure. It is to be understood that other embodiments may be utilized and that mechanical, electrical, and/or process changes may be made without departing from the scope of the present disclosure.</p>

The proportion and the relative scale of the elements provided in the figures are intended to illustrate the embodiments of the present disclosure and should not be taken in a limiting sense.</p>
<p id="p-0022" num="0021">The figures herein follow a numbering convention in which the first digit or digits correspond to the drawing figure number and the remaining digits identify an element or component in the drawing.</p>
<p id="p-0023" num="0022">As used herein, &#x201c;a&#x201d;, &#x201c;an&#x201d;, or &#x201c;a number of&#x201d; something can refer to one or more such things, while &#x201c;a plurality of&#x201d; something can refer to more than one such things. For example, &#x201c;a number of components&#x201d; can refer to one or more components, while &#x201c;a plurality of components&#x201d; can refer to more than one component.</p>
<p id="p-0024" num="0023"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref> is an illustration of a perspective view of an aspirated smoke, gas, or air quality monitoring system device that can be used in accordance with an embodiment of the present disclosure. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>, in some embodiments, each detector module (which in the embodiment illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref> has two sample tubes associated with it) and the system has detector modules that can be individually removed and/or replaced.</p>
<p id="p-0025" num="0024">This can be beneficial as individual modules can be selectively removed for maintenance or repair without having to disconnect the sampling tubes. Similarly, the insect guard can be removed and cleaned or replaced.</p>
<p id="p-0026" num="0025">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>, the illustrated embodiment is a modular aspirated smoke, gas, or air quality monitoring system device <b>100</b> that includes a base <b>102</b> onto which a number of detector modules <b>104</b> are attached thereto. The base <b>102</b> includes a number of components thereon. For example, the base includes a cable conduit <b>112</b> (large tube) that allows cabling to be routed through the interior of the conduit and connected to the aspirated smoke, gas, or air quality monitoring system device via an aperture in the device.</p>
<p id="p-0027" num="0026">The cable conduit <b>112</b> connects to a cable management module <b>108</b> portion of the base <b>102</b>. The cable management module <b>108</b> has a housing with a cover to keep connections for power and data communication to and from the device out of sight and secure from tampering. The cable conduit also provides those functions. In the embodiment of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>, the cable management module is located on the left side of the device, however, the embodiments of the present disclosure are not so limited.</p>
<p id="p-0028" num="0027">In the embodiment of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>, next to the cable management module is a communications module <b>110</b>. The communications module <b>110</b> includes an easy access reset button (<b>316</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref>) on the front. The communication module <b>110</b> also can include other operational buttons and/or dials within the housing and a cover (<b>318</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref>) to also keep them out of sight and secure from tampering. In some embodiments, the cover can be or have a portion that is at least partially translucent, allowing a technician to see the status of the buttons/dials (e.g., their current settings), so the technician can see their status, but the buttons/dials are not accessible to be tampered with.</p>
<p id="p-0029" num="0028">In some embodiments, the covers of one or more modules of the aspirated smoke, gas, or air quality monitoring system device can be secured such that they need to be removed by a tool (specialized tool carried by a technician). In this manner, it is likely that those wishing to tamper with the aspirated smoke, gas, or air quality monitoring system device will not be able to access the internal components of the modules.</p>
<p id="p-0030" num="0029">On the right side of the aspirated smoke, gas, or air quality monitoring system device illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>, a number of detector modules <b>104</b>-<b>1</b> . . . <b>104</b>-N (referred to generally as modules <b>104</b>) are provided. These detector modules each contain one or more sensors that sense one or more environmental elements in the sampled air moving through the one or more tubes connected to the detector. Sensors can, for example, detect particulate, such as smoke particles, or gases, such as carbon monoxide, carbon dioxide, and/or detect other environmental elements that may indicate less than desirable air quality.</p>
<p id="p-0031" num="0030">In the embodiment illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>, each detector <b>104</b> is connected to multiple channels/tubes <b>114</b>. The aspirated smoke, gas, or air quality monitoring system device embodiment illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref> also includes five detector modules <b>104</b> each having two channels, meaning this device can sample on ten channels, however the number of modules and/or channels per module is not so limited. The embodiment of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref> also includes a mounting bracket <b>150</b> for mounting the device to a wall or rack.</p>
<p id="p-0032" num="0031"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref> is an illustration of an aspirated smoke, gas, or air quality monitoring system that can be used in accordance with an embodiment of the present disclosure. In such a system, the aspirated smoke, gas, or air quality monitoring system can include a sensing unit <b>202</b> (unit <b>102</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>) having a detector module (module <b>104</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>) that includes at least one particulate sensing chamber within the detector module and an air inlet (<b>424</b> in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b></figref>) connecting one end of the sampling tube <b>214</b> to the particulate sensing chamber allowing communication of air from the sampling tube <b>214</b> to the particulate sensing chamber.</p>
<p id="p-0033" num="0032">A sampling point <b>222</b> is connected at the other end of the sampling tube <b>214</b>. The sampling point collects air from an area being monitored and a pump pulls the air through the sampling point <b>222</b> into the sampling tube <b>214</b>, through the tube and into the sensing unit <b>202</b>, where the air is tested for particulate, chemicals or other items that may be harmful to occupants or indicate an emergency condition (fire) in the monitored area.</p>
<p id="p-0034" num="0033">A spiral shaped insect guard (<b>440</b> in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b></figref>) can be positioned in the sampling point <b>222</b>, sampling tube <b>214</b>, or sensing unit <b>202</b>. Locating the insect guard in the sensing unit can be beneficial as it allows for easy access for cleaning and/or replacement. Locating the insect guard in the sampling point or in the sampling tube can be beneficial as the location is closer to where the insects enter the system.</p>
<p id="p-0035" num="0034">The monitoring system can be configured to be located within a building and as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref>, the sensing unit can be configured to be located in a first location (first room) and the sample point configured to be located in a second location (second room) that is different than the first location. For example, the second location can be remotely located (office area) from the first location (building mechanical area).</p>
<p id="p-0036" num="0035"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref> is an illustration of a perspective view of an aspirated smoke, gas, or air quality monitoring system device with one of the detector modules removed in accordance with an embodiment of the present disclosure. As in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref> also shows the cable conduit <b>312</b>, the cable management module <b>308</b> and the communication module <b>310</b>, with reset button <b>316</b> and cover <b>318</b>. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref> also provides a more detailed view of the interior components of the base as well as the detector module and its filter module/cover.</p>
<p id="p-0037" num="0036">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref>, the detector modules are independently removeable from the base <b>302</b> of system <b>300</b>. Each detector module also has a cover thereon that is removable. The cover can have a display <b>320</b> that indicates a status condition of the individual detector. In some embodiments, the cover can be a filter module as described in more detail below.</p>
<p id="p-0038" num="0037"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref> also illustrates that the base <b>302</b> can have a number of tube connections that connect the tubes <b>314</b> to its associated detector module and circuitry connections for providing connections for power and data transmission purposes of the components of the module, such as for sensing components and data collection. Similar connections are also shown on the front surface of the detector. These connections can be used for attachment of other modules that can be added on (e.g., gas sensing module and/or air quality module, added to a smoke sensing module) to the detector module. In the embodiment of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref> the base <b>302</b> can include a pump to facilitate movement of air through the tubes <b>314</b> and through the modules <b>304</b>. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref> also shows the mounting bracket <b>350</b> attached to the back side of the base <b>302</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0039" num="0038">In some embodiments, each detector module can also have a filter that can be removed from the detector module without disassembling the detector module. Such functionality can thereby save the technician's time during maintenance of the system.</p>
<p id="p-0040" num="0039"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b></figref> is an exploded view illustration of one of the detector modules removed showing the insect guards in accordance with an embodiment of the present disclosure. In the embodiment illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b></figref>, the module <b>404</b> has multiple particulate sensing chamber inlets <b>424</b> on side <b>423</b> that corresponds with side <b>323</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref>. The inlets each connect to a different particulate sensing chamber within the module <b>404</b>, and multiple particulate sensing chamber outlets <b>434</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0041" num="0040">In use, the module <b>404</b> is connected, via inlets <b>424</b> and outlets <b>434</b> to corresponding inlet and outlet ports of the base <b>302</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref>, such that the air to be tested can be communicated from tubes <b>314</b> to the module <b>304</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0042" num="0041">As can be understood from the layout of the module shown, in the embodiment of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b></figref>, the module <b>404</b> can be used to sample air through air paths (path of air through the sampling point, sampling tube, and detector module) from two sampling tubes <b>414</b>. However, some embodiments may have more or less air sampling paths provided therein.</p>
<p id="p-0043" num="0042">Each air sampling path draws air in from one of the tubes <b>314</b> and tests the air to see if it contains smoke, undesired chemicals, or a threshold level of particulate (by using a sensor in the particulate sensing chamber designed to identify one or more such particles). Additionally, the sensors can be easily changed to repurpose a unit to sense a different type of particle which can be beneficial in some implementations.</p>
<p id="p-0044" num="0043">In the embodiment illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b></figref>, the insect guard <b>440</b> is a spiral shaped removable insect guard mounted within the inlet <b>424</b>. In some embodiments, the interior surface of the inlet <b>424</b> has a ledge <b>444</b> formed thereon and where the ledge <b>444</b> is shaped to allow a portion of an outer surface of the insect guard to rest on the ledge <b>444</b>. For example, the non-ledge portion of the interior surface of the inlet has a first diameter, but the portion where the ledge is located has a second diameter that is smaller than the first diameter. The diameter of the insect guard is less than the first diameter, but larger than the second diameter. In this way, the insect guard is sized to fit inside the inlet, but large enough so that an outer edge of the insect guard rests on the ledge, thereby fixing the insect guard inside the inlet.</p>
<p id="p-0045" num="0044">The implementation of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b></figref> also includes a gasket <b>442</b> that is inserted into the inlet <b>424</b> after the insect guard <b>440</b> is inserted and inhibits the removal of the insect guard <b>440</b> from the inlet <b>424</b>. The gasket <b>442</b> frictionally interacts with the inner surface of the inlet <b>424</b> to inhibit the removal of the insect guard <b>440</b> from the inlet <b>424</b>. In some embodiments, an adhesive material is interposed between an outer surface of the gasket <b>442</b> and the inner surface of the inlet <b>424</b> to inhibit the removal of the insect guard <b>440</b> from the inlet <b>424</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0046" num="0045">The spiral of the spiral insect guard <b>440</b> is comprised of a number of coils of wire that are coiled around a central reference point forming the center of the spiral. The spacing between these wire coils can be any suitable distance. For example, the spacing distance can be determined based on an applicable government standard. For instance, in one example embodiment, the spiral of the spiral insect guard <b>440</b> is comprised of a single wire that is coiled in a number of coils of wire and wherein a maximum opening size between adjacent outside surfaces of two adjacent coils is not greater than 1.27 mm.</p>
<p id="p-0047" num="0046"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>5</b>A-<b>5</b>E</figref> are illustrations of different wire element cross sectional shapes in accordance with different embodiments of the present disclosure. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b>A</figref> provides the easiest design to manufacture with the wire element forming the spiral insect guard have a circular cross section <b>541</b>-A.</p>
<p id="p-0048" num="0047">Another easy to manufacture design is shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b>B</figref>, with a rectangular cross section <b>541</b>-B. This design may be beneficial in implementations where less particulate settling on the guard is desired as, if the air is traveling from top to bottom, its top surface area is less than the circular cross section embodiment.</p>
<p id="p-0049" num="0048">Other quadrilateral shapes can be used. For example, in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b>C</figref>, an end of a rectangular cross sectional can be tapered to reduce the top surface to reduce the flat area that particulate can collect on and increase aerodynamics which increases airflow around the wire and decreases air turbulence which reduces the ability for particulate to land on the surfaces of the wire.</p>
<p id="p-0050" num="0049">Such aerodynamic effects can also be provided by the designs shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>5</b>D and <b>5</b>E</figref> at <b>541</b>-D and <b>541</b>-E. These ellipsoidal and tear drop designs have a larger top area which will provide more area to collect particulate, but both increase flow speed and decrease resistance due to turbulence.</p>
<p id="p-0051" num="0050">The embodiments of the present disclosure provide greater flexibility in creating an aspirated smoke, gas, or air quality monitoring system that includes an insect guard that provides more air flow and allows the insect guard to be independently cleanable and/or replaceable.</p>
<p id="p-0052" num="0051">It is to be understood that the above description has been made in an illustrative fashion, and not a restrictive one. Combination of the above embodiments, and other embodiments not specifically described herein will be apparent to those of skill in the art upon reviewing the above description.</p>
