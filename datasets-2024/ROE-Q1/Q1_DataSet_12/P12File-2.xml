<p id="p-0001" num="0000">A control device controls a water supply device that supplies irrigation water to an open farm field in which a plant grows. The control device includes a storage unit, a calculation unit, and an output unit. The storage unit stores an environment value of each of a plurality of divided areas obtained by dividing the farm field and weather forecast of the farm field. The calculation unit calculates, based on an environment value and the weather forecast, an irrigation schedule in which supply time and amount of the irrigation water individually supplied to each of the plurality of divided areas during the irrigation period are determined. The output unit outputs to the water supply device, a control signal to control supply and no supply of the irrigation water to each of the plurality of divided areas based on the irrigation schedule.</p>

<p id="p-0049" num="0048">Hereinafter, examples of the present disclosure will be described.</p>
<p id="p-0050" num="0049">According to an example of the present disclosure, an automatic irrigation system includes a water supply device and a control device. The control device controls the timing and amount of water supplied from the water supply device to a farm field.</p>
<p id="p-0051" num="0050">Application of the automatic irrigation system to a location other than a greenhouse may involve a risk of a soil moisture content being unsuitable for plants growing in the farm field due to a weather change or the like.</p>
<p id="p-0052" num="0051">A control device according to an example of the present disclosure is configured to control a water supply device, which is configured to supply irrigation water to an open farm field in which a plant grows, to control a supply time and an amount of the irrigation water supplied to the farm field. The control device comprises:</p>
<p id="p-0053" num="0052">a storage unit configured to store an environment value, which is input from an environment sensor provided to each of a plurality of divided areas obtained by dividing the farm field, and a weather forecast for the farm field, which is input from an external information source;</p>
<p id="p-0054" num="0053">a calculation unit configured to calculate, based on the environment value and the weather forecast, an irrigation schedule in which the supply time and the amount of the irrigation water individually supplied to each of the plurality of divided areas during an irrigation period are determined; and</p>
<p id="p-0055" num="0054">an output unit configured to output to the water supply device, a control signal to control supply and no supply of the irrigation water to each of the plurality of divided areas based on the irrigation schedule.</p>
<p id="p-0056" num="0055">An irrigation program according to an example of the present disclosure is to be executed by a processor to cause the processor to</p>
<p id="p-0057" num="0056">acquire an environment value, which is input from an environment sensor provided to each of a plurality of divided areas obtained by dividing an open farm field in which a plant grows, and a weather forecast, which is input from an external information source,</p>
<p id="p-0058" num="0057">calculate, based on the environment value and the weather forecast, an irrigation schedule in which a supply time and an amount of irrigation water individually supplied to each of the plurality of divided areas during an irrigation period are determined, and</p>
<p id="p-0059" num="0058">output a control signal to control supply and no supply of the irrigation water to the divided areas based on the irrigation schedule.</p>
<p id="p-0060" num="0059">As described above, the irrigation schedule is determined based on the environment value and the weather forecast. Thus, the soil moisture content of an outdoor divided area is prevented from being a value unsuitable for the plants due to weather changes such as rainfall and drying.</p>
<p id="p-0061" num="0060">Hereinafter, a plurality of embodiments of the present disclosure will be described with reference to the drawings. In each embodiment, the same reference numerals are given to portions corresponding to the matters described in the preceding embodiments, and redundant description may be omitted. In a case where only a part of the configuration is described in each embodiment, other embodiments previously described are applicable to the remaining part of the configuration.</p>
<p id="p-0062" num="0061">Parts of embodiment that are clearly described to be specifically combinable can be combined with each other. Partial combination between embodiments, between an embodiment and a modification, and between modifications is possible even if they are not clearly described to be combinable, as long as the combination leads to no problem.</p>
<heading id="h-0007" level="1">First Embodiment</heading>
<p id="p-0063" num="0062">An irrigation system according to the present embodiment will be described based on <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>1</b> to <b>20</b></figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0064" num="0063">Hereinafter, three directions orthogonal to each other are referred to as an x direction, a y direction, and a z direction. In the present embodiment, a plane defined by the x direction and the y direction is along the horizontal plane. The z direction is along the vertical direction. In the drawings, the word &#x201c;direction&#x201d; is omitted, and x, y, and z are simply described.</p>
<p id="p-0065" num="0064">&#x3c;Farm Field&#x3e;</p>
<p id="p-0066" num="0065">An irrigation system <b>10</b> is applied to an open farm field <b>20</b> cultivated in hills and plains. To simplify the following description, as illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>, an embodiment in which the irrigation system <b>10</b> is applied to the farm field <b>20</b> cultivated in a plain will be described. The size of the farm field <b>20</b> is several tens of square meters to several thousands of square kilometers.</p>
<p id="p-0067" num="0066">The farm field <b>20</b> is provided with a plurality of growth sites such as ridges extending in the x direction. These plurality of growth sites extending in the x direction are arranged apart from each other in the y direction. The seeds and seedlings of plants <b>30</b> are planted in each of the plurality of growth sites. Examples of the plants <b>30</b> include grape, corn, almond, raspberry, leaf vegetables, cotton, and the like.</p>
<p id="p-0068" num="0067">A plurality of the plants <b>30</b> are grown in one growth site. As illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>, the plurality of plants <b>30</b> are arranged in the x direction to form a column. Hereinafter, the plurality of plants <b>30</b> arranged in a column in the x direction is referred to as a plant group <b>31</b>. In the farm field <b>20</b>, a plurality of the plant groups <b>31</b> are arranged apart from each other in the y direction.</p>
<p id="p-0069" num="0068">The minimum separation distance between of the plurality of plant groups <b>31</b> in the y direction is longer than the minimum separation distance between the plurality of plants <b>30</b> included in one plant group <b>31</b> in the x direction. The separation interval of the plurality of plant groups <b>31</b> in the y direction is variously changed according to the type of the plants <b>30</b> grown as well as the undulations and climate of the farm field <b>20</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0070" num="0069">The separation interval of the plurality of plant groups <b>31</b> in the y direction is about 1 m to 10 m. This guarantees a space sufficient for at least a person to move in the x direction between two plant groups <b>31</b> even if branches and leaves of the plants <b>30</b> vigorously grow in the y direction.</p>
<p id="p-0071" num="0070">&#x3c;Irrigation System&#x3e;</p>
<p id="p-0072" num="0071">The irrigation system <b>10</b> includes a water supply device <b>100</b> and a control device <b>200</b>. The water supply device <b>100</b> supplies irrigation water to the plants <b>30</b> in the farm field <b>20</b>. The control device <b>200</b> determines the supply time and amount of the irrigation water from the water supply device <b>100</b> to the plants <b>30</b> during an irrigation period. The control device <b>200</b> determines an irrigation schedule for the water supply device <b>100</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0073" num="0072">&#x3c;Water Supply Device&#x3e;</p>
<p id="p-0074" num="0073">The water supply device <b>100</b> includes a pump <b>110</b>, a water supply pipe <b>130</b>, and a piping module <b>150</b>. The pump <b>110</b> supplies the irrigation water to the water supply pipe <b>130</b>. The piping module <b>150</b> controls discharge of the irrigation water supplied to the water supply pipe <b>130</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0075" num="0074">&#x3c;Pump&#x3e;</p>
<p id="p-0076" num="0075">The pump <b>110</b> is in a constantly driven sate. Alternatively, the pump <b>110</b> is in a daytime driving state. The pump <b>110</b> pumps out the irrigation water stored in a tank or a reservoir and supplies the irrigation water to the water supply pipe <b>130</b>. Examples of the irrigation water include well water, river water, rainwater, city water, and the like.</p>
<p id="p-0077" num="0076">As described below, the water supply pipe <b>130</b> is provided with a plurality of water supply valves <b>152</b>. When each of the plurality of water supply valves <b>152</b> is in a closed state and the irrigation water is not leaking from the water supply pipe <b>130</b>, the water supply pipe <b>130</b> is filled with the irrigation water. In this state, the water pressure in the water supply pipe <b>130</b> is of a value (pump pressure) depending on the discharge capacity of the pump <b>110</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0078" num="0077">When the water supply valve <b>152</b> transitions to an open state from the closed state, the irrigation water is discharged from the water supply pipe <b>130</b> to the farm field <b>20</b>. Once the discharge amount of the irrigation water is stabilized on a time-average basis, the water pressure in the water supply pipe <b>130</b> is flow pressure lower than the pump pressure.</p>
<p id="p-0079" num="0078">&#x3c;Water Supply Pipe&#x3e;</p>
<p id="p-0080" num="0079">Water supply pipe <b>130</b> includes a main pipe <b>131</b> and drip pipe <b>132</b>. The main pipe <b>131</b> is connected to the pump <b>110</b>. The drip pipe <b>132</b> is connected to the main pipe <b>131</b>. The pump <b>110</b> supplies the irrigation water from the main pipe <b>131</b> to the drip pipe <b>132</b>. This irrigation water is supplied from the drip pipe <b>132</b> to the farm field <b>20</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0081" num="0080">&#x3c;Main Pipe&#x3e;</p>
<p id="p-0082" num="0081">The main pipe <b>131</b> includes a longitudinal pipe <b>133</b> and a lateral pipe <b>134</b>. The longitudinal pipe <b>133</b> extends in the y direction. The lateral pipe <b>134</b> extends in the x direction. The longitudinal pipe <b>133</b> and the lateral pipe <b>134</b> are connected to each other. With such a configuration, the irrigation water flows in the y direction and the x direction in the main pipe <b>131</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0083" num="0082">In the example illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>, one longitudinal pipe <b>133</b> is connected to one pump <b>110</b>. A plurality of the lateral pipes <b>134</b> extend in the x direction from the longitudinal pipe <b>133</b> extending in they direction. The position of the lateral pipe <b>134</b> in the z direction is set to be more separated from the ground than the apices of the plants <b>30</b> fully grow are.</p>
<p id="p-0084" num="0083">Needless to say, the configuration illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref> is merely an example. The number of pumps <b>110</b> and longitudinal pipes <b>133</b> provided in the farm field <b>20</b>, the number of longitudinal pipes <b>133</b> connected to one pump <b>110</b>, the number of longitudinal pipes <b>133</b> connected to one lateral pipe <b>134</b>, and the positions of the lateral pipes <b>134</b> and the longitudinal pipes <b>133</b> in the z direction are not particularly limited.</p>
<p id="p-0085" num="0084">The plurality of lateral pipes <b>134</b> are arranged apart from each other in the y direction. The minimum separation distance between the plurality of lateral pipes <b>134</b> in the y direction is equivalent to the minimum separation distance between the plurality of plant groups <b>31</b> in the y direction. One of the plurality of lateral pipes <b>134</b> is provided to one of the plurality of plant groups <b>31</b>. The lateral pipe <b>134</b> extends along a direction (x direction) in which the plurality of plants <b>30</b> included in the plant group <b>31</b> are arranged. The drip pipe <b>132</b> is connected to the lateral pipe <b>134</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0086" num="0085">&#x3c;Drip Pipe&#x3e;</p>
<p id="p-0087" num="0086">A plurality of the drip pipes <b>132</b> are connected to one lateral pipe <b>134</b>. The plurality of drip pipes <b>132</b> connected to one lateral pipe <b>134</b> are arranged apart from each other in the x direction.</p>
<p id="p-0088" num="0087">As illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref>, the drip pipe <b>132</b> includes an extension pipe <b>135</b> and branch pipes <b>136</b>. The extension pipe <b>135</b> extends downward in the z direction from the lateral pipe <b>134</b>. Two connection ports open in the x direction are formed on the distal end sides of the extension pipe <b>135</b>. The branch pipes <b>136</b> are connected to these two connection ports.</p>
<p id="p-0089" num="0088">The branch pipes <b>136</b> include a first branch pipe <b>136</b><i>a </i>connected to one of the two connection ports and a second branch pipe <b>136</b><i>b </i>connected to the other of the two connection ports. The first branch pipe <b>136</b><i>a </i>and the second branch pipe <b>136</b><i>b </i>extend in directions opposite to each other in the x direction from positions connected with the extension pipe <b>135</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0090" num="0089">In each of the first branch pipe <b>136</b><i>a </i>and the second branch pipe <b>136</b><i>b</i>, a drip hole <b>137</b> through which an internal space where the irrigation water flows communicates with an external space outside the internal space is formed. The drip hole <b>137</b> is opened on the lower surface on the ground side of each of the first branch pipe <b>136</b><i>a </i>and the second branch pipe <b>136</b><i>b. </i></p>
<p id="p-0091" num="0090">The drip hole <b>137</b> may be opened on the upper surface on the sky side of each of the first branch pipe <b>136</b><i>a </i>and the second branch pipe <b>136</b><i>b</i>. The drip hole <b>137</b> may be opened on the side surface, connecting the upper surface and the lower surface, of each of the first branch pipe <b>136</b><i>a </i>and the second branch pipe <b>136</b><i>b. </i></p>
<p id="p-0092" num="0091">A plurality of the drip holes <b>137</b> are formed in each of the first branch pipe <b>136</b><i>a </i>and the second branch pipe <b>136</b><i>b</i>. The plurality of drip holes <b>137</b> are arranged apart from each other in the x direction. The separation interval between the plurality of drip holes <b>137</b> in the x direction is equivalent to the separation interval between the plurality of plants <b>30</b> in the x direction. Three drip holes <b>137</b> are formed in each of the first branch pipe <b>136</b><i>a </i>and the second branch pipe <b>136</b><i>b </i>in the example illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0093" num="0092">The separation interval between the plurality of drip holes <b>137</b> may be different from the separation interval between the plurality of plants <b>30</b>. The number of drip holes <b>137</b> formed in the first branch pipe <b>136</b><i>a </i>and the second branch pipe <b>136</b><i>b </i>is not limited to three.</p>
<p id="p-0094" num="0093">&#x3c;Flow of Irrigation Water&#x3e;</p>
<p id="p-0095" num="0094">The irrigation water supplied to the longitudinal pipe <b>133</b> by the pump <b>110</b> flows in the y direction in the longitudinal pipe <b>133</b>. This irrigation water is supplied to each of the plurality of lateral pipes <b>134</b> connected to the longitudinal pipe <b>133</b>. The irrigation water flows in the x direction in each of the plurality of lateral pipes <b>134</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0096" num="0095">The irrigation water flowing in the lateral pipe <b>134</b> flows into the branch pipe <b>136</b> through the extension pipe <b>135</b>. This irrigation water is discharged from the drip holes <b>137</b> of each of the first branch pipe <b>136</b><i>a </i>and the second branch pipe <b>136</b><i>b</i>. Thus, the irrigation water is supplied to the plant <b>30</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0097" num="0096">In the example illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>, each of the first branch pipe <b>136</b><i>a </i>and the second branch pipe <b>136</b><i>b </i>is located more on the ground side of the farm field <b>20</b> than the apex side of the plant <b>30</b> in the z direction. The irrigation water dripping from the drip holes <b>137</b> of the first branch pipe <b>136</b><i>a </i>and the second branch pipe <b>136</b><i>b </i>is mainly supplied to the trunk and the root of the plants <b>30</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0098" num="0097">&#x3c;Water Spray Nozzle&#x3e;</p>
<p id="p-0099" num="0098">A configuration may be employed in which a water spray nozzle is attached to the drip holes <b>137</b>. An injection direction of the irrigation water injected from the water spray nozzle may be directed toward the ground side or the sky side in the z direction. When the irrigation water is injected toward the sky, the injection direction of the irrigation water is more likely to spread in the horizontal direction as compared with the configuration in which the irrigation water is injected toward the ground. Therefore, the irrigation water injected from the water spray nozzle is sprayed over a wide range of the farm field <b>20</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0100" num="0099">Whether the irrigation water is injected toward the ground side or the sky side can be determined based on the type of the plant <b>30</b> to which the irrigation water is supplied, the depth of the soil layer of the farm field <b>20</b>, the climate of the farm field <b>20</b>, and the like. For example, in cases of the plant <b>30</b> having roots growing widely, a shallow soil layer, or a climate under which the drying is less likely to occur, the irrigation water is injected toward the sky side. In cases of the plant <b>30</b> having roots growing deeply, a deep soil layer, or a climate under which the drying is likely to occur, the irrigation water is injected toward the ground side.</p>
<p id="p-0101" num="0100">&#x3c;Piping Module&#x3e;</p>
<p id="p-0102" num="0101">As simply illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref>, the drip pipe <b>132</b> is provided with the piping module <b>150</b>. The piping module <b>150</b> includes a storage box <b>151</b>, the water supply valve <b>152</b>, and a water pressure sensor <b>153</b>. The water supply valve <b>152</b> and water pressure sensor <b>153</b> are stored in the storage box <b>151</b>. The storage box <b>151</b> is illustrated in a cross-sectional view in the drawing.</p>
<p id="p-0103" num="0102">&#x3c;Water Supply Valve&#x3e;</p>
<p id="p-0104" num="0103">The water supply valve <b>152</b> is provided on the side of the position, of each of the first branch pipe <b>136</b><i>a </i>and the second branch pipe <b>136</b><i>b</i>, connected with the extension pipe <b>135</b>. All the drip holes <b>137</b> are located between the respective distal end sides of the first branch pipe <b>136</b><i>a </i>and the second branch pipe <b>136</b><i>b</i>, away from the extension pipe <b>135</b>, and the water supply valves <b>152</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0105" num="0104">When the water supply valves <b>152</b> is in the open state, the extension pipe <b>135</b> and the drip holes <b>137</b> communicate with each other. Thus, the irrigation water is discharged from the drip holes <b>137</b>. On the other hand, once the water supply valves <b>152</b> is in the closed state, the extension pipe <b>135</b> and the drip holes <b>137</b> are no longer in communication with each other. Thus, the discharging of the irrigation water from the drip holes <b>137</b> stops.</p>
<p id="p-0106" num="0105">The water supply valve <b>152</b> provided to the first branch pipe <b>136</b><i>a </i>and the water supply valve <b>152</b> provided to the second branch pipe <b>136</b><i>b </i>are controlled by the control device <b>200</b> to be opened and closed independently from one another. With this opening/closing control, the discharge of the irrigation water from the drip holes <b>137</b> of the first branch pipe <b>136</b><i>a </i>and the discharge of the irrigation water from the drip holes <b>137</b> of the second branch pipe <b>136</b><i>b </i>are controlled independently from each other. As the water supply valve <b>152</b>, an electromagnetic valve is employed that can be switched between the open state and the closed state in response to a discharge signal input and not input.</p>
<p id="p-0107" num="0106">&#x3c;Water Pressure Sensor&#x3e;</p>
<p id="p-0108" num="0107">The water pressure sensor <b>153</b> is provided on each of the side of the two connection ports of the extension pipe <b>135</b> connected to the first branch pipe <b>136</b><i>a </i>and the second branch pipe <b>136</b><i>b</i>. The two water pressure sensors <b>153</b> each detect the water pressure in the extension pipe <b>135</b>. The water pressure detected by the water pressure sensor <b>153</b> is output to the control device <b>200</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0109" num="0108">The locations where the water pressure sensors <b>153</b> are disposed are not limited to the example described above. For example, the water pressure sensor <b>153</b> may be provided at each of a location between the position of the first branch pipe <b>136</b><i>a </i>connected to the extension pipe <b>135</b> and the position where the water supply valve <b>152</b> is located, and a location between the position of the second branch pipe <b>136</b><i>b </i>connect to the extension pipe <b>135</b> and the position where the water supply valve <b>152</b> is located.

<p id="p-0174" num="0173">As described below, the microcomputer <b>330</b> is intermittently driven with the sleep mode and the normal mode alternately repeated. Therefore, wireless communications between the communication unit <b>340</b> and the integrated communication unit <b>400</b> are infrequently performed. A time interval during which wireless communications are performed between the communication unit <b>340</b> and the integrated communication unit <b>400</b> is long.

<p id="p-0176" num="0175">The power generation unit <b>360</b> includes a solar cell <b>361</b>, a power storage unit <b>362</b>, a current sensor <b>363</b>, and a power sensor <b>364</b>.

<p id="p-0177" num="0176">The solar cell <b>361</b> converts light energy into electric energy. The power storage unit <b>362</b> stores the electric energy (electric power).

<p id="p-0178" num="0177">The current sensor <b>363</b> detects current output from the solar cell <b>361</b> to the power storage unit <b>362</b>.

The processing unit <b>334</b> also stores the current and the electric power in the information storage unit <b>500</b> via the communication unit <b>340</b> and the integrated communication unit <b>400</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0179" num="0178">The driving power for the monitoring units <b>300</b> depends on the electric power generated by the power generation unit <b>360</b>. Therefore, when the amount of light incident on the power generation unit <b>360</b> is small, the driving power of monitoring unit <b>300</b> might be depleted.

<p id="p-0183" num="0182">The integrated calculation unit <b>600</b> calculates the power storage amount based on the electric power stored in the information storage unit <b>500</b>. The integrated calculation unit <b>600</b> sets a longer intermittent driving interval for a smaller power storage amount. Conversely, the integrated calculation unit <b>600</b> sets a shorter intermittent driving interval for a larger power storage amount.</p>
<p id="p-0184" num="0183">The integrated calculation unit <b>600</b> provides the intermittent driving interval in the instruction signal. The processing unit <b>334</b> of the microcomputer <b>330</b> adjusts the intermittent driving interval upon acquiring the instruction signal.

<p id="p-0185" num="0184">A massive change in the environment of the farm field <b>20</b> rarely occurs in units of several seconds.

Alternatively, each of the plurality of monitoring units <b>300</b> determines the irrigation schedule based on the environment value detected by the environment sensor <b>310</b>.</p>

<p id="p-0250" num="0249">In a case where the farm field <b>20</b> is wide, has severe undulations, or is under severe weather, information transmission between the integrated calculation unit <b>600</b> and each of the plurality of monitoring units <b>300</b> may fail due to a communication failure. The wireless communications between the integrated communication unit <b>400</b> and each of the plurality of monitoring units <b>300</b> may fail.</p>
<p id="p-0251" num="0250">Without taking into consideration the undulations of and an obstacle in the farm field <b>20</b> hindering the communications, the monitoring unit <b>300</b> with a short separation distance from the integrated communication unit <b>400</b> is expected to be less likely to have a communication failure with the integrated communication unit <b>400</b>, compared with the monitoring unit <b>300</b> with a long separation distance from the integrated communication unit <b>400</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0252" num="0251">Therefore, for example, among the plurality of monitoring units <b>300</b>, the monitoring unit <b>300</b> with a short separation distance from the integrated communication unit <b>400</b> is defined as a child device, and the monitoring unit <b>300</b> having a long separation distance is referred to as a grandchild device.

<p id="p-0253" num="0252">&#x3c;Weather Forecast and Irrigation Schedule&#x3e;</p>
<p id="p-0254" num="0253">As described above, the information storage unit <b>500</b> stores the current value of the soil moisture content, the change/decrease predicted value, and the user instruction. The information storage unit <b>500</b> stores the growth inhibition moisture point and the permanent wilting point of the plants <b>30</b>, the water absorption amount which is an amount of water absorbed by the plants <b>30</b> per unit time, and the water retention capacity of the soil.</p>
<p id="p-0255" num="0254">Furthermore, the information storage unit <b>500</b> stores the weather forecast for the farm field <b>20</b> output/distributed from an external information source <b>1000</b> as illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref> and <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref>.

<p id="p-0257" num="0256">&#x3c;Target Value and Estimation Value&#x3e;</p>
<p id="p-0258" num="0257">When determining the irrigation schedule, the integrated calculation unit <b>600</b> calculates, for example, a target value and an estimation value of the soil moisture content illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>14</b> to <b>19</b></figref>. In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>14</b> to <b>19</b></figref>, the vertical axis represents the soil moisture content. The horizontal axis represents time. In the drawings, the soil moisture content is denoted as W, and the time is denoted as T.</p>
<p id="p-0259" num="0258">It is a matter of course that the target value of the soil moisture content is set to a value between the growth inhibition moisture point and the permanent wilting point. For the sake of sound growth of the plant <b>30</b>, the target value of the soil moisture content is set to a value with a certain amount of difference from each of the growth inhibition moisture point and the permanent wilting point which are theoretical values.</p>
<p id="p-0260" num="0259">The integrated calculation unit <b>600</b> sets, as the target value of the soil moisture content, an upper limit target value on the growth inhibition moisture point side and a lower limit target value on the permanent wilting point side. In the irrigation period for which the irrigation schedule is set, the integrated calculation unit <b>600</b> determines the irrigation schedule with the estimation value of the soil moisture content set between the upper limit target value and the lower limit target value. Furthermore, the integrated calculation unit <b>600</b> determines the irrigation schedule in such a manner that the estimation value of the soil moisture content does not exceed the growth inhibition moisture point, even when the estimation value of the soil moisture content is expected to exceed the upper limit target value due to heavy rain. The upper limit target value corresponds to the first target value. The lower limit target value corresponds to the second target value.</p>
<p id="p-0261" num="0260">In the drawings, the growth inhibition moisture point is denoted as GBMP, the permanent wilting point is denoted as PWP, the upper limit target value is denoted as ULT, and the lower limit target value is denoted as LLT. The growth inhibition moisture point and the permanent wilting point are indicated by broken lines. The upper limit target value and the lower limit target value are indicated by one-dot chain lines. The estimation value of the soil moisture content is indicated by a solid line.</p>
<p id="p-0262" num="0261">There is a difference between the growth inhibition moisture point and the upper limit target value. This upper limit difference range is determined based on the climate of the farm field <b>20</b> in consideration of the sound growth of the plants <b>30</b> described above. The climate of the farm field <b>20</b> includes an expected value of an average rainfall amount of the farm field <b>20</b> in the irrigation period of the irrigation schedule and a total rainfall amount predicted by the weather forecast in the irrigation period of the irrigation schedule. The expected value of the average rainfall amount of the farm field <b>20</b> in the irrigation period is stored in the information storage unit <b>500</b>. In the drawings, the upper limit difference range is denoted as ULD.</p>
<p id="p-0263" num="0262">Similarly, there is a difference between the permanent wilting point and the lower limit target value. The lower limit difference range is determined based on a recovery time expected to be required for the recovery of the water supply device <b>100</b> that has failed, a decrease amount of the soil moisture content per unit time, and the like, in consideration of the sound growth of the plants <b>30</b>. For example, the lower limit difference range is determined based on a value obtained by multiplying the recovery time by the soil moisture content decrease amount per unit time. The recovery time is stored in the information storage unit <b>500</b>. In the drawings, the lower limit difference range is denoted as LLD.</p>
<p id="p-0264" num="0263">For example, when a weather forecast for one week from the external information source <b>1000</b> is stored in the information storage unit <b>500</b>, the integrated calculation unit <b>600</b> determines the irrigation schedule for one week. When the weather forecast indicates that there will be no rainfall with in the week, the estimation value of the soil moisture content is expected to gradually decrease with the lapse of time. The decrease amount of the estimation value of the soil moisture content per unit time is determined based on the predicted value of the change/decrease in the soil moisture content of the soil layer. Hereinafter, in order to simplify the description, the estimation value of the soil moisture content is simply referred to as an estimation value as necessary.</p>
<p id="p-0265" num="0264">&#x3c;Irregular Water Supply&#x3e;</p>
<p id="p-0266" num="0265">In the example illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>14</b></figref>, the estimation value gradually decreases from a time point t<b>0</b> due to evaporation of water from the soil layer and the like. As a result of the gradual decrease, the estimation value is expected to fall below the lower limit target value at a time point t<b>1</b>. Therefore, the integrated calculation unit <b>600</b> determines the start of the irrigation water supply at the time point t<b>1</b>. As described above as an example, the irrigation water supply start time point can be set to the time point at which the estimation value reaches the lower limit target value.</p>
<p id="p-0267" num="0266">The integrated calculation unit <b>600</b> determines the water supply amount at the time point t<b>1</b> so that the estimation value reaches the upper limit target value. That is, the integrated calculation unit <b>600</b> determines water supply time tsw from the time point t<b>1</b>. At a time point t<b>2</b> arriving when the water supply time tsw elapses, the estimation value reaches the upper limit target value. Thereafter, the estimation value gradually decreases again. In the drawings, the water supply time tsw is illustrated in an exaggerated manner, that is, longer than actual.</p>
<p id="p-0268" num="0267">With the water supply described above, the estimation value is expected to be between the upper limit target value and the lower limit target value at a time point te one week after the time point t<b>0</b>. Therefore, the integrated calculation unit <b>600</b> determines not to supply the irrigation water between the time point t<b>2</b> and the time point te.</p>
<p id="p-0269" num="0268">Further example will be described. Specifically, as illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>15</b></figref> as an example, when the weather forecast indicates rainfall in an amount expressed with a bar at a time point tr during the irrigation period of the irrigation schedule, the integrated calculation unit <b>600</b> determines the irrigation schedule as follows.</p>
<p id="p-0270" num="0269">Also in the example illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>15</b></figref>, the estimation value gradually decreases from the time point t<b>0</b>. The estimation value is expected to fall below the lower limit target value at a time point t<b>1</b>. Therefore, the integrated calculation unit <b>600</b> determines the start of the irrigation water supply at the time point t<b>1</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0271" num="0270">However, the forecast indicates the rainfall at the time point tr after the time point t<b>1</b>. Therefore, the integrated calculation unit <b>600</b> determines the supply amount of the irrigation water at the time t<b>1</b> so that the estimation value reaches the upper limit target value at the time point tr based on the supply of the irrigation water at the time point t<b>1</b> and the rainfall at the time point tr. The water supply time tsw from the time point t<b>1</b> illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>15</b></figref> is shorter than the water supply time tsw from the time t<b>1</b> illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>14</b></figref> due to rainfall at the time point tr.</p>
<p id="p-0272" num="0271">The irrigation water supply starts at the time point t<b>1</b>, and at a time point t<b>3</b> after elapse of the water supply time tsw, the irrigation water supply ends. The estimation value increases to be slightly smaller than the upper limit target value as a result of this irrigation water supply.</p>
<p id="p-0273" num="0272">Thereafter, the estimation value gradually decreases again. Still, due to the rainfall at the time point tr, the estimation value is expected to reach a value at or around the upper limit target value.</p>
<p id="p-0274" num="0273">Note that, in this example, it is indicated that the estimation value reaches the upper limit target value at the time point tr. However, when the estimation value reaches the upper limit target value or a value (intermediate target value) smaller than the upper limit target value is not particularly limited, as long as the estimation value increased by the irrigation water supply and rainfall does not exceed the upper limit target value. The intermediate target value is a value between the upper limit target value and the lower limit target value. The intermediate target value is an intermediate value between the upper limit target value and the lower limit target value for example.</p>
<p id="p-0275" num="0274">&#x3c;Regular Water Supply&#x3e;</p>
<p id="p-0276" num="0275">In the example of the irrigation schedule described above, the irrigation water supply start time point is set to a time point when the estimation value reaches the lower limit target value. Alternatively, a configuration may be employed in which the irrigation water supply start time point is set in advance.</p>
<p id="p-0277" num="0276">Hereinafter, the irrigation schedule according to such a configuration will be described based on <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>16</b> to <b>19</b></figref>. In this example, the water supply is scheduled to be performed for a total of three times at a predetermined water supply interval during the irrigation period of the irrigation schedule. The irrigation water supply is performed at time points ts<b>1</b>, ts<b>2</b>, and ts<b>3</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0278" num="0277">As illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>16</b></figref> as an example, when the weather forecast indicates no rainfall during the irrigation period, the integrated calculation unit <b>600</b> determines the irrigation schedule as follows.</p>
<p id="p-0279" num="0278">The estimation value is expected to gradually decrease from the time point t<b>0</b> to the first supply time point ts<b>1</b>. The integrated calculation unit <b>600</b> determines the water supply amount at the first supply time point ts<b>1</b> so that the estimation value reaches the upper limit target value.

<p id="p-0281" num="0280">After the water supply at the second supply time point ts<b>2</b> is performed, the estimation value gradually decreases until the third supply time point ts<b>3</b>. The integrated calculation unit <b>600</b> determines third water supply time tsw<b>3</b> from the third supply time point ts<b>3</b> so that the estimation value reaches the upper limit target value.</p>
<p id="p-0282" num="0281">By performing the irrigation water supply based on the irrigation schedule described above, the estimation value is expected to be a value slightly smaller than the upper limit target value at the time point to a week after the time point t<b>0</b>. It is expected that the soil moisture content around the upper limit target value is maintained in the irrigation schedule. It is a matter of course that the soil moisture content around the intermediate target value may be maintained in the irrigation schedule by adjusting the water supply amount at the supply time.</p>
<p id="p-0283" num="0282">As illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>17</b></figref> as an example, when the weather forecast indicates rainfall in an amount expressed with a bar at the time point tr during the irrigation period, the integrated calculation unit <b>600</b> determines the irrigation schedule as follows.</p>
<p id="p-0284" num="0283">The estimation value gradually decreases from the time point t<b>0</b> to the first supply time point ts<b>1</b> also in the example illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>17</b></figref>. The integrated calculation unit <b>600</b> determines the first water supply time tsw<b>1</b> from the first supply time point ts<b>1</b> so that the estimation value reaches the upper limit target value.</p>
<p id="p-0285" num="0284">Thereafter, the estimation value gradually decreases until the second supply time point ts<b>2</b>.

Thus, the integrated calculation unit <b>600</b> determines the second water supply time tsw<b>2</b> from the second supply time point ts<b>2</b> so that the estimation value reaches the upper limit target value at the time point tr, as a result of the irrigation water supply at the second supply time point ts<b>2</b> and the rainfall at the time point tr. The second water supply time tsw<b>2</b> illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>17</b></figref> is shorter than the second water supply time tsw<b>2</b> illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>16</b></figref> due to rainfall at the time point tr.</p>
<p id="p-0286" num="0285">After the water supply at the second supply time point ts<b>2</b> is performed, the estimation value increases to be slightly smaller than the upper limit target value.

<p id="p-0287" num="0286">Thereafter, the estimation value gradually decreases until the third supply time point ts<b>3</b> after the rainfall at the time point tr. In this case, the integrated calculation unit <b>600</b> determines the third water supply time tsw<b>3</b> from the third supply time point ts<b>3</b> so that the estimation value reaches the upper limit target value. The third water supply time tsw<b>3</b> illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>17</b></figref> is shorter than the third water supply time tsw<b>3</b> illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>16</b></figref> due to rainfall at the time point tr after the second water supply time tsw<b>2</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0288" num="0287">As illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>18</b></figref> as an example, when the weather forecast indicates heavy rainfall in an amount expressed with a bar at the time point tr during the irrigation period, the integrated calculation unit <b>600</b> determines the irrigation schedule as follows.</p>
<p id="p-0289" num="0288">The integrated calculation unit <b>600</b> determines whether the estimation value exceeds the upper limit target value at the time point tr, due to the irrigation water supply at the second supply time point ts<b>2</b> and the rainfall at the time point tr. In the example illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>18</b></figref>, since the amount of rainfall at the time point tr is large, the estimation value is expected to exceed the upper limit target value at the time point tr, even if it is determined to stop the water supply at the second supply time point ts<b>2</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0290" num="0289">Therefore, for example, as illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>19</b></figref>, the integrated calculation unit <b>600</b> reduces the water supply amount at the first supply time point ts<b>1</b> by an amount corresponding to the difference between the estimation value at the time point tr and the upper limit target value as a result of stopping the water supply at the second supply time point ts<b>2</b>.

<p id="p-0291" num="0290">As described above, the integrated calculation unit <b>600</b> determines the irrigation schedule so that the estimated amount of the total water supply amount at the supply time before the forecasted rainfall time is prevented from exceeding the upper limit target value at the forecasted rainfall time.</p>
<p id="p-0292" num="0291">The estimation value is expected to exceed the upper limit target value at the forecasted rainfall time due to the heavy rain and to fall below the lower limit target value at a time point before the forecasted rainfall time. In this case, the integrated calculation unit <b>600</b> perform the water supply at a supply time point before the forecasted rainfall time, without making the estimation value exceed the growth inhibition moisture point at the forecasted rainfall time.</p>
<p id="p-0293" num="0292">The estimation value may fall below the lower limit target value during the regular supply times due to sudden drying. In view of this, the irregular water supply described based on <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>14</b></figref> and <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>15</b></figref> may be performed in addition to the regular water supply described above based on <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>16</b></figref> to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>19</b></figref>. That is, the water supply may be performed at the timing when the estimation value reaches the lower limit target value between the regular supply times. Alternatively, in order to avoid such irregular water supply, the water supply interval may be changed based on the decrease amount of the estimation value per unit time.</p>
<p id="p-0294" num="0293">The supply time and the forecasted rainfall time may overlap. The rainfall amount is merely a forecast, and it is difficult to predict how much the soil moisture content increases due to rainfall. Therefore, if water is supplied during rainfall, the soil moisture content may excessively increase beyond expectation. To avoid this, when the supply time and the forecasted rainfall time overlap, the integrated calculation unit <b>600</b> changes the supply time to be later than the forecasted rainfall time without making the estimation value fall below the lower limit target value.</p>

<p id="p-0310" num="0309">The integrated calculation unit <b>600</b> determines the water supply amount to prevent the estimation value of the soil moisture content from falling below the lower limit target value higher than the permanent wilting point over the entirety of the irrigation period of the irrigation schedule. The integrated calculation unit <b>600</b> determines a range of difference between the permanent wilting point and the lower limit target value (lower limit difference range) based on the recovery time, the decrease amount in the soil moisture content per unit time, and the like.</p>
<p id="p-0311" num="0310">With the lower limit difference range thus set, even if the soil moisture content is close to the lower limit target value but the irrigation water cannot be supplied due to a failure of the water supply valves <b>152</b> or the like, the soil moisture content is prevented from reaching the permanent wilting point before the recovery from the failure.</p>
<p id="p-0312" num="0311">The integrated calculation unit <b>600</b> supplies water at a timing when the estimation value of the soil moisture content reaches the lower limit target value in the irrigation schedule. As a result, the soil moisture content is prevented from falling below the lower limit target value.</p>
<p id="p-0313" num="0312">The integrated calculation unit <b>600</b> set the irrigation water supply time to be different from the forecasted rainfall time. Thus, even if the amount of rainfall is larger than that forecasted, excessive increase in the soil moisture content is suppressed.</p>
<heading id="h-0008" level="1">Second Embodiment</heading>
<p id="p-0314" num="0313">Next, a second embodiment will be described based on <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>21</b> to <b>24</b></figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0315" num="0314">In the example described in the first embodiment, the integrated calculation unit <b>600</b> determines the irrigation schedule for each of the plurality of divided areas using the weather forecast input from the external information source <b>1000</b>. On the other hand, in the present embodiment, the integrated calculation unit <b>600</b> predicts a weather change in the farm field <b>20</b> based on the environment value detected by each of the plurality of monitoring units <b>300</b>. Then, the integrated calculation unit <b>600</b> determines the irrigation schedule for each of the plurality of divided areas, by using the weather prediction.</p>
<p id="p-0316" num="0315">For example, in Japan, an automatic weather data collection system called AMeDAS is provided at a weather observation point in each region. Weather data such as rainfall amount, temperature, sunshine duration, wind direction, and wind speed are observed by AMeDAS provided at the weather observation points in these regions. In addition, weather data such as distribution and transition of rain clouds over Japan is observed by a weather satellite or the like. The Meteorological Agency announces the weather forecast based on the weather data observed by AMeDAS at the local weather observation points and the weather satellites.</p>
<p id="p-0317" num="0316">The similar applies to other countries. The weather forecast based on weather data observed by observation devices at local weather observation points and satellites provided are announced in each country.</p>
<p id="p-0318" num="0317">Unfortunately, the weather observation points where the weather data is acquired are not equally distributed. The distribution density of the weather observation points is higher in a region with a higher population density. Thus, the distribution density of the weather observation points is lower in a region with a lower population density.</p>
<p id="p-0319" num="0318">The farm field <b>20</b> provided with the irrigation system <b>10</b> is generally cultivated in a region with a lower population density. Therefore, the weather change of the cultivated area of the entire farm field <b>20</b> may be collectively notified by the weather forecast with no difference among parts in the farm field <b>20</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0320" num="0319">Generally, the farm field <b>20</b> cultivated in a region with a low population density is wide and has severe undulations. The climate of the farm field <b>20</b> may be severe. Thus, the weather may largely differ between the east side and west side of the farm field <b>20</b>, contrary to the weather forecast notifying a change in weather in the entire farm field <b>20</b>. There may be heavy rain on the east side, while the weather is fine on the west side. Depending on the movement of rain clouds, an accumulated rainfall amount or an accumulated solar radiation amount in one day may significantly differ between the east side and the west side. Thus, there may be a case where the weather forecast is the same between the east side and the west side, but the weather changes differently between the east side and the west side.</p>
<p id="p-0321" num="0320">In view of this, the irrigation system <b>10</b> of the present embodiment predicts a change in weather of the farm field <b>20</b> based on the environment value detected in each of the plurality of divided areas. Then, the irrigation schedule for each of the plurality of divided areas is determined by using the weather prediction.</p>
<p id="p-0322" num="0321">In the present embodiment, the environment sensor <b>310</b> of each of the plurality of monitoring units <b>300</b> include the soil moisture sensor <b>311</b>, the solar radiation sensor <b>312</b>, the rain sensor <b>313</b>, the temperature sensor <b>314</b>, the humidity sensor <b>315</b>, the atmospheric pressure sensor <b>316</b>, and the wind sensor <b>317</b>. The environment values of the divided areas are detected by these various sensors.</p>
<p id="p-0323" num="0322">As described above, the plurality of monitoring units <b>300</b> are arranged in a matrix in the farm field <b>20</b>. In order to simplify the description of the present embodiment, as schematically illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>21</b> to <b>23</b></figref>, it is assumed that 100 monitoring units <b>300</b> are arranged in a matrix of 10 rows and 10 columns in the farm field <b>20</b>. The row direction corresponds to the x direction and extends along the east-west direction. The column direction corresponds to the y direction and extends along the north-south direction.</p>
<p id="p-0324" num="0323">In these drawings, for example, among the various components illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>, those not so related to the matrix arrangement of the monitoring units <b>300</b> described below are omitted. In addition, in order to avoid complication of notation, reference numerals are given only to the monitoring units <b>300</b> in the 10th row and the 10th column.</p>
<p id="p-0325" num="0324">In the drawings, the row numbers and the column numbers increase in a direction away from the pump <b>110</b>. For example, the first row is denoted as <b>1</b>L, and the first column is denoted as <b>1</b>C. The side with a smaller row number is the north side, and the side with a larger row number is the south side. The side with a smaller column number is the east side, and the side with a larger column number is the west side. In the example illustrated, the integrated communication unit <b>400</b> is located on the east side of the farm field <b>20</b>. Therefore, the monitoring unit <b>300</b> with a smaller column number corresponds to the monitoring unit <b>300</b> located closer to the integrated communication unit <b>400</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0326" num="0325">In the configuration illustrated in the drawings, the plurality of monitoring units <b>300</b> located in the first to fifth rows of the first to fifth columns detect the environment value on the northeast side of the farm field <b>20</b>. The plurality of monitoring units <b>300</b> located in the sixth to tenth columns of the first to fifth rows detect the environment value on the northwest side of the farm field <b>20</b>. The plurality of monitoring units <b>300</b> located in the first to fifth columns of the sixth to tenth rows detect the environment value on the southeast side of the farm field <b>20</b>. The plurality of monitoring units <b>300</b> located in the sixth to tenth columns of the sixth to tenth rows detect the environment value on the southwest side of the farm field <b>20</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0327" num="0326">In the following, in order to simplify the description, the plurality of monitoring units <b>300</b> provided on the northeast side, the northwest side, the southeast side, and the southwest side of the farm field <b>20</b> are collectively denoted as a northeast monitoring unit group <b>301</b>, a northwest monitoring unit group <b>302</b>, a southeast monitoring unit group <b>303</b>, and a southwest monitoring unit group <b>304</b>, respectively. In the drawings, boundary lines BL for distinguishing these four monitoring unit groups are one-dot chain lines. Each of these four monitoring unit groups includes a total of 25 monitoring units <b>300</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0328" num="0327">For example, as illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>22</b></figref>, when a rain cloud RC hatched in the drawing is located on the southwest side of the farm field <b>20</b>, rainfall is detected in some of the plurality of monitoring units <b>300</b> included in the southwest monitoring unit group <b>304</b>. Of course, no rainfall is detected by each of the plurality of monitoring units <b>300</b> included in the other three monitoring unit groups. Through the detection of rainfall, the rain cloud RC is detected to be only on the southwest side of the farm field <b>20</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0329" num="0328">For example, when the rain cloud RC moves with elapse of a predetermined period of time as illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>23</b></figref>, the number of monitoring units <b>300</b> that detect raindrops in the southwest monitoring unit group <b>304</b> increases. The direction and the speed of the movement of the rain cloud RC is detected based on a difference in the environment value between the plurality of monitoring units <b>300</b> adjacent to each other in the row direction and the column direction.</p>
<p id="p-0330" num="0329">The monitoring unit <b>300</b> located in the ninth row and the ninth column will be representatively used for the description. The monitoring unit <b>300</b> is located immediately below the rain cloud RC at the timing of each of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>22</b> and <b>23</b></figref>. Thus, the monitoring unit <b>300</b> detects raindrops at both of these timings.</p>
<p id="p-0331" num="0330">On the other hand, each of the monitoring unit <b>300</b> in the eighth row and the ninth column, the monitoring unit <b>300</b> in the eighth row and the eighth column, and the monitoring unit <b>300</b> located in the ninth row and the eighth column adjacent to this monitoring unit <b>300</b> is not located immediately below the rain cloud RC at the timing of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>22</b></figref>. Thus, these three monitoring unit <b>300</b> detect no raindrops at the timing of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>22</b></figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0332" num="0331">At the timing of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>23</b></figref> after the elapse of the predetermined period of time, each of the three monitoring units <b>300</b> is located immediately below the rain cloud RC. Thus, these three monitoring unit <b>300</b> detect the raindrops at the timing of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>23</b></figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0333" num="0332">The movement of the rain cloud RC from location of the ninth row and the ninth column to the location of the eighth row and the ninth column is observed, based on a temporal change in the raindrop detection by the plurality of monitoring units <b>300</b> over time. Thus, the movement of the rain cloud RC toward the northwest side of the farm field <b>20</b> is observed.</p>
<p id="p-0334" num="0333">Similarly, the movement of the rain cloud RC from the location at the ninth row and the ninth column to the location at the eighth row and the eighth column is observed. Thus, the movement of the rain cloud RC toward the northeast side of the farm field <b>20</b> is observed.</p>
<p id="p-0335" num="0334">The movement of the rain cloud RC from the location at the ninth row and the ninth column to the location at the ninth row and the eighth column is observed. Thus, the movement of the rain cloud RC toward the southeast side of the farm field <b>20</b> is observed.</p>
<p id="p-0336" num="0335">At the timing of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>23</b></figref>, no raindrop is detected by each of the monitoring units <b>300</b> in the seventh row and the ninth column and the seventh row and the seventh column, whereas raindrop is detected by the monitoring unit <b>300</b> located in the ninth row and the seventh column.</p>
<p id="p-0337" num="0336">Such a difference between the detection results indicates that the rain cloud RC is moving faster toward the southeast side of the farm field <b>20</b> than toward the northwest side and the northeast side.</p>
<p id="p-0338" num="0337">As described above, it is possible to predict how the rain cloud RC generated in a partial region of the farm field <b>20</b> moves to another region by detecting a difference in environment values such as raindrops detected by the plurality of monitoring units <b>300</b> or a temporal change thereof. Furthermore, it is possible to actually detect and predict a temporal change in rainfall amount and the accumulated rainfall amount in the farm field <b>20</b>. Furthermore, it is possible to actually detect and predict a temporal change in solar radiation amount and the integrated solar radiation amount in the farm field <b>20</b>. Thus, a weather change in the farm field <b>20</b> can be detected and predicted.</p>
<p id="p-0339" num="0338">This weather prediction is performed by the integrated calculation unit <b>600</b>. The integrated calculation unit <b>600</b> updates the irrigation schedule for each of the plurality of monitoring units <b>300</b> based on the weather prediction.</p>
<p id="p-0340" num="0339">&#x3c;Weather Prediction Processing&#x3e;</p>
<p id="p-0341" num="0340">The integrated calculation unit <b>600</b> executes the weather prediction processing illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>24</b></figref> as the cycle task. A result of this processing is reflected on the irrigation schedule update processing described based on <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>20</b></figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0342" num="0341">In step S<b>710</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>24</b></figref>, the integrated calculation unit <b>600</b> calculates a temporal change in the environment value detected by each of the plurality of monitoring units <b>300</b>. In addition, the integrated calculation unit <b>600</b> calculates a difference between and temporal change in various environment values detected by the monitoring units <b>300</b> adjacent to each other in the row direction and the column direction. Regarding the examples illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>21</b> to <b>23</b></figref>, the integrated calculation unit <b>600</b> calculates a difference between and a temporal change in various environment values detected by the monitoring units <b>300</b> included in the four monitoring unit groups. Then, the integrated calculation unit <b>600</b> proceeds to step S<b>720</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0343" num="0342">Upon proceeding to step S<b>720</b>, the integrated calculation unit <b>600</b> determines whether the value calculated in step S<b>710</b> exceeds a detection error. Without taking into consideration temporary blocking of sunlight by clouds or the like as well as undulations and soil difference between divided areas of the farm field <b>20</b> and the like, the calculated value is expected to not exceed the detection error as long as there is no change in weather. When there is a change in weather, the calculated value is expected to exceed the detection error. In view of this, the integrated calculation unit <b>600</b> identifies an area with a change in weather and an area without a change in weather, based on whether the calculated value exceeds the detection error. Regarding the change in rainfall amount illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>22</b></figref> and <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>23</b></figref> only, part of the farm field <b>20</b> on the southwest side is the area with a change in weather, and other areas are the areas without a change in weather.</p>
<p id="p-0344" num="0343">Next, the integrated calculation unit <b>600</b> calculates a geographical separation distance (far or close) between the area with a change in weather the area without a change in weather. Based on the separation distance and a temporal change in the environment value in the area with a change in weather, the integrated calculation unit <b>600</b> performs calculation to figure out which area will have the rainfall or fine weather in each area, and when. In this manner, the integrated calculation unit <b>600</b> performs weather prediction for each of the plurality of divided areas based on the environment values detected in the plurality of divided areas. Then, the integrated calculation unit <b>600</b> proceeds to step S<b>730</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0345" num="0344">Upon proceeding to step S<b>730</b>, the integrated calculation unit <b>600</b> calculates a difference between the weather prediction calculated in step S<b>720</b> and the weather forecast notified from the external information source <b>1000</b>. The difference between the weather prediction and the weather forecast is reflected on, for example, step S<b>125</b> of the irrigation schedule update processing described based on <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>20</b></figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0346" num="0345">When the difference between the weather prediction and the weather forecast is larger than a predetermined weather determination value, the irrigation schedule on the earlier side of the irrigation period may be determined using only the weather prediction among the weather prediction and the weather forecast.</p>
<p id="p-0347" num="0346">Note that the integrated calculation unit <b>600</b> may determine the irrigation schedule based on the weather prediction without acquiring the weather forecast from the external information source <b>1000</b>. In this case, the integrated calculation unit <b>600</b> does not execute step S<b>730</b> illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>24</b></figref>. In addition, the irrigation period of the irrigation schedule set in this case is shorter than the irrigation period in the case of using the weather forecast.</p>
<p id="p-0348" num="0347">&#x3c;Operations and Effects&#x3e;</p>
<p id="p-0349" num="0348">As described above, the integrated calculation unit <b>600</b> updates the irrigation schedule based on the weather prediction for the farm field <b>20</b>. Thus, the soil moisture content of the open farm field <b>20</b> is prevented from exceeding the growth inhibition moisture point or falling below the permanent wilting point due to a change in weather. The soil moisture content is controlled to be suitable for the plants <b>30</b>. As a result, inhibition of the sound growth of the plant <b>30</b> is suppressed.</p>
<p id="p-0350" num="0349">The irrigation system <b>10</b> described in the present embodiment includes at least one of the components of the irrigation system <b>10</b> described in the first embodiment. Therefore, it is a matter of course that the irrigation system <b>10</b> of the present embodiment performs and provides the operations and effects described in the first embodiment using the same components as those of the irrigation system <b>10</b> described in the first embodiment.

<p id="p-0384" num="0388">In step S<b>870</b>, the integrated calculation unit <b>600</b> determines a basic content of the sensor processing based on the power storage amount and the current time.

This means that the integrated calculation unit <b>600</b> increases the processing load on the sensor processing. The integrated calculation unit <b>600</b> determines a simpler processing content for the sensor processing, for a larger rainfall amount. This means that the integrated calculation unit <b>600</b> reduces the processing load on the sensor processing.</p>
<p id="p-0385" num="0389">As described based on <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>6</b></figref>, in the sensor processing, the microcomputer <b>330</b> of each of the plurality of monitoring units <b>300</b> acquires sensor signals input from various sensors, and outputs the sensor signals and the acquisition time to the integrated communication unit <b>400</b> via the communication unit <b>340</b> through wireless communication. The richness of the processing content of the sensor processing corresponds to the number of the plurality of sensor signals input from various sensors and processed. A richer processing content of the sensor processing is provided for a larger number of sensor signals processed. A larger number of sensor signals processed leads to a larger processing load. On the other hand a smaller number of sensor signals processed leads to a smaller processing load.</p>
<p id="p-0386" num="0390">As described above, the types of sensor signals include water pressure, current, electric power, soil moisture content, solar radiation amount, rainfall amount, temperature, humidity, atmospheric pressure, and air volume. These are selected under priority for the sensor processing. As an example of the priority, for example, the water pressure, the electric power, the soil moisture content, the solar radiation amount, the rainfall amount, the current, the temperature, the humidity, the atmospheric pressure, and the air volume are selected in this order. The water pressure, the electric power, and the soil moisture content have higher priorities over the others. The solar radiation amount and the rainfall amount are given priority lower than these. Compared with these, the priorities of the current, the temperature, the humidity, the atmospheric pressure, and the air volume are low. In the sensor processing with the processing content simplified as much as possible, at least one of the water pressure, the power storage amount, and the soil moisture content is output from the communication unit <b>340</b> to the integrated communication unit <b>400</b> through wireless communications.</p>
<p id="p-0387" num="0391">Upon proceeding to step S<b>860</b> by determining that the rainfall amount is equal to or smaller than the rainy weather determination value in step S<b>840</b> which is an earlier step in the flow, the integrated calculation unit <b>600</b> detects a temporal change in the power storage amount and the solar radiation amount. Then, the integrated calculation unit <b>600</b> corrects, that is, increments or decrements the power storage amount and the solar radiation amount as described above. Then, the integrated calculation unit <b>600</b> proceeds to step S<b>880</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0388" num="0392">Upon proceeding to step S<b>880</b>, the integrated calculation unit <b>600</b> determines the intermittent driving interval and the processing content of the sensor processing, based on each of the power storage amount and the solar radiation amount corrected by being incremented or decremented in step S<b>860</b> and on the current time.</p>

Similarly, upon proceeding to step S<b>830</b> by determining that the power storage amount is equal to or smaller than the charge value in step S<b>810</b>, the integrated calculation unit <b>600</b> detects a temporal change in the power storage amount.

<p id="p-0391" num="0395">In steps S<b>830</b> and S<b>890</b>, the intermittent driving interval and the processing content of the sensor processing may be simply set to prescribed values. The prescribed value can be set with the longest intermittent driving interval, with the water pressure, the power storage amount, the soil moisture content selected for the sensor processing, and the like.</p>
<p id="p-0392" num="0396">When water is provided as a result of sudden rain or water supply although the weather is fine, the solar radiation amount detected by the solar radiation sensor <b>312</b> unexpectedly changes due to refraction of light caused by water droplets and evaporation of the water droplets. As a result, rainfall is temporarily detected by the rain sensor <b>313</b>. In order to prevent the intermittent driving interval and the processing content of the sensor processing from changing each time such a change occurs, the integrated calculation unit <b>600</b> may use time average values of the solar radiation amount and the rainfall amount in the sensor processing update processing.</p>
<p id="p-0393" num="0397">&#x3c;Operations and Effects&#x3e;</p>
<p id="p-0394" num="0398">As described above, the intermittent driving interval (wake-up interval) is determined based on the power storage amount, the solar radiation amount, the rainfall amount, and time. Thus, the intermittent driving interval is determined based on the power storage amount of the monitoring unit <b>300</b> and the environment value of the farm field <b>20</b>. As a result, depletion of the power storage amount is prevented.</p>
<p id="p-0395" num="0399">The intermittent driving interval is appropriately made short based on the power storage amount and the environment value of the farm field <b>20</b>. Thus, the sensor processing is executed at a shorter interval, with a decrease of the power storage amount suppressed. As a result, a decrease in the update frequency of the sensor information stored in the information storage unit <b>500</b> is suppressed. As a result, the irrigation schedule determined based on the sensor information becomes close to the irrigation schedule determined based on the actual environment value of the farm field <b>20</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0396" num="0400">When the power storage amount is equal to or smaller than the charge value, the intermittent driving interval is determined based on the power storage amount regardless of the solar radiation amount and the rainfall amount. With this configuration, the intermittent driving interval is prevented from being shortened even when the power storage amount is equal to or smaller than the charge value, due to detection of a solar radiation amount by the solar radiation sensor <b>312</b> temporary receiving light emitted from lighting equipment at night for example. Thus, depletion of the power storage amount is prevented.</p>
<p id="p-0397" num="0401">When the solar radiation amount is equal to or smaller than the day/night determination value, the intermittent driving interval is determined based on the power storage amount regardless of the solar radiation amount. With this configuration, variation of the intermittent driving interval based on the solar radiation amount and the rainfall amount can be prevented at night during which power generation by the solar cell <b>361</b> receiving light cannot be expected.</p>
<p id="p-0398" num="0402">When the rainfall amount is equal to or smaller than the rainy weather determination value, the intermittent driving interval is determined regardless of the rainfall amount. With this configuration, the intermittent driving interval is prevented from varying due to temporary provision of water by rainfall or water supply, in a case where there is actually no rainfall.</p>
<p id="p-0399" num="0403">Thus, the richness of the processing content of the sensor processing is determined based on the power storage amount of the monitoring unit <b>300</b> and the environment value of the farm field <b>20</b>. Thus, the amount of power consumed by the sensor processing is determined based on the power storage amount of the monitoring unit <b>300</b> and the environment value of the farm field <b>20</b>.

<p id="p-0438" num="0450">A fourth embodiment will be described below based on <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>32</b></figref> to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>35</b></figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0439" num="0451">The monitoring unit <b>300</b> of the present embodiment includes a sensor case <b>370</b> illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>32</b> and <b>33</b></figref>. The sensor case <b>370</b> stores the solar radiation sensor <b>312</b>, the rain sensor <b>313</b>, and the control unit <b>320</b>. In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>33</b></figref>, only the microcomputer <b>330</b>, the solar cell <b>361</b>, and the current sensor <b>363</b> among the components of the control unit <b>320</b> are illustrated.</p>
<p id="p-0440" num="0452">The sensor case <b>370</b> includes a cylindrical housing <b>371</b> whose axial direction extends in the z direction and a lid portion <b>372</b> that closes an opening of the housing <b>371</b>. The housing <b>371</b> has two bottom surfaces arranged in the z direction, with the bottom surface on the ground side closed and with the bottom surface on the sky side open. The lid portion <b>372</b> closes the opening of the bottom surface on the sky side.</p>
<p id="p-0441" num="0453">The lid portion <b>372</b> is translucent. Therefore, light such as sunlight incident on an outer surface <b>372</b><i>a </i>of the lid portion <b>372</b> enters the inside of the lid portion <b>372</b> through the outer surface <b>372</b><i>a </i>of the lid portion <b>372</b>. This light propagates inside the lid portion <b>372</b>, and then is emitted, from an inner surface <b>372</b><i>b </i>on the side opposite to the outer surface <b>372</b><i>a</i>, into the internal space of the housing <b>371</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0442" num="0454">Each of the solar radiation sensor <b>312</b>, the rain sensor <b>313</b>, and the solar cell <b>361</b> is disposed in the internal space of the housing <b>371</b> to face the inner surface <b>372</b><i>b </i>of the lid portion <b>372</b>. Therefore, the light emitted from the inner surface <b>372</b><i>b </i>is incident on each of the solar radiation sensor <b>312</b> and the solar cell <b>361</b>. The light can propagate between the rain sensor <b>313</b> and the outer surface <b>372</b><i>a. </i></p>
<p id="p-0443" num="0455">With such an arrangement configuration, the solar radiation amount is detected by the solar radiation sensor <b>312</b>. The rain sensor <b>313</b> detects a water droplet adhering to the outer surface <b>372</b><i>a</i>. The solar cell <b>361</b> converts light energy into electric energy.</p>
<p id="p-0444" num="0456">When the outer surface <b>372</b><i>a </i>of the lid portion <b>372</b> on which the light is incident is contaminated, the light is difficult to enter into the lid portion <b>372</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0445" num="0457">As illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>33</b></figref>, the solar radiation sensor <b>312</b> and the solar cell <b>361</b> are separated from each other in a direction orthogonal to the z direction. Therefore, the solar radiation sensor <b>312</b> and the solar cell <b>361</b> face different regions of the outer surface <b>372</b><i>a</i>. A region of the outer surface <b>372</b><i>a </i>through which light mainly incident on the solar radiation sensor <b>312</b> passes is different from that through which the light mainly incident on the solar cell <b>361</b> passes.</p>
<p id="p-0446" num="0458">For example, when a region (solar radiation region) of the outer surface <b>372</b><i>a </i>through which the light incident on the solar radiation sensor <b>312</b> is expected to pass is contaminated, the amount of light incident on the solar radiation sensor <b>312</b> is reduced. As a result, the detection accuracy of the solar radiation amount is compromised.</p>
<p id="p-0447" num="0459">Similarly, when a region (solar region) of the outer surface <b>372</b><i>a </i>through which the light incident on the solar cell <b>361</b> is expected to pass is contaminated, the amount of light incident on the solar cell <b>361</b> is reduced. As a result, the power generation amount is reduced.</p>
<p id="p-0448" num="0460">The rain sensor <b>313</b> is separated from each of the solar radiation sensor <b>312</b> and the solar cell <b>361</b> in the direction orthogonal to the z direction. Thus, a region (rain region) of the outer surface <b>372</b><i>a </i>where the rain sensor <b>313</b> mainly detects the adhering of the water droplet is different in position from the solar radiation region and the solar region described above. When the rain region is contaminated, the water droplet detection accuracy of the rain sensor <b>313</b> is compromised.</p>
<p id="p-0449" num="0461">In order to solve such an issue, a wiper <b>373</b> is provided on the outer surface <b>372</b><i>a </i>side of the lid portion <b>372</b> of the sensor case <b>370</b>. A motor <b>374</b> for driving the wiper <b>373</b> is provided in the housing <b>371</b>. The wiper <b>373</b> driven by the motor <b>374</b> slides on the outer surface <b>372</b><i>a</i>. Through the rotation of the wiper <b>373</b>, the contaminant adhering to the outer surface <b>372</b><i>a </i>of the lid portion <b>372</b> is wiped off. Thus, the entrance of the light into the lid portion <b>372</b> is less likely to be hindered.</p>
<p id="p-0450" num="0462">However, when no liquid such as water is on the outer surface <b>372</b><i>a</i>, it may be difficult for the wiper <b>373</b> sliding on the outer surface <b>372</b><i>a </i>to remove the contaminant adhering to the outer surface <b>372</b><i>a</i>. Furthermore, the outer surface <b>372</b><i>a </i>may be scratched by the wiper <b>373</b> sliding on the outer surface <b>372</b><i>a</i>, due to increased friction between the wiper <b>373</b> and the outer surface <b>372</b><i>a</i>. When the outer surface <b>372</b><i>a </i>is scratched, diffused reflection of light occurs at the location of the scratch, and thus the light may be less likely to enter into the lid portion <b>372</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0451" num="0463">&#x3c;Wiping Processing&#x3e;</p>
<p id="p-0452" num="0464">Therefore, the microcomputer <b>330</b> executes the wiping processing illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>34</b></figref> as the cycle task in parallel with the sensor processing described based on <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>6</b></figref>. The microcomputer <b>330</b> includes a contamination determination value as a comparison value for performing the wiping processing.</p>
<p id="p-0453" num="0465">In step S<b>1010</b> in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>34</b></figref>, the microcomputer <b>330</b> acquires the solar radiation amount and the amount of current. Then, the microcomputer <b>330</b> proceeds to step S<b>1020</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0454" num="0466">Upon proceeding to step S<b>1020</b>, the microcomputer <b>330</b> calculates the power generation amount expected to be achieved by the solar cell <b>361</b> based on the solar radiation amount detected by the solar radiation sensor <b>312</b>. At the same time, the microcomputer <b>330</b> calculates the amount of power generated by the solar cell <b>361</b> based on the amount of current detected by the current sensor <b>363</b>. Thereafter, the microcomputer <b>330</b> proceeds to step S<b>1030</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0455" num="0467">Upon proceeding to step S<b>1030</b>, the microcomputer <b>330</b> obtains a difference between the power generation amount based on the solar radiation amount and the power generation amount achieved by the solar cell <b>361</b> calculated based on the amount of current. It is determined whether the absolute value of the difference is larger than the contamination determination value. When the absolute value of the difference is larger than the contamination determination value, the microcomputer <b>330</b> proceeds to step S<b>1040</b>. When the absolute value of the difference is equal to or smaller than the contamination determination value, the microcomputer <b>330</b> ends the wiping processing.</p>
<p id="p-0456" num="0468">The contamination determination value can be determined, for example, based on a difference between a power generation amount expected to be achieved by the solar cell <b>361</b> with theoretically maximum contamination and a power generation amount expected by the solar cell <b>361</b> with no contamination at all. The contamination determination value is a value for determining whether the power generation amount has decreased to an extent that cannot be explained by the deterioration of the solar cell <b>361</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0457" num="0469">As described above, the position of the solar radiation region on the outer surface <b>372</b><i>a </i>through which the light incident on the solar radiation sensor <b>312</b> is expected to pass is different from that of the solar region on the outer surface <b>372</b><i>a </i>through which the light incident on the solar cell <b>361</b> is expected to pass. Thus, the solar radiation region and the solar region are less likely to have the same level of contamination. The solar radiation region and the solar region are expected to have difference levels of contamination adhered.</p>
<p id="p-0458" num="0470">Therefore, as described above, the difference between the power generation amount calculated based on the solar radiation amount on the solar radiation sensor <b>312</b> after passing through the solar radiation region, and the power generation amount achieved by the solar cell <b>361</b> calculated based on the amount of current detected by the current sensor <b>363</b>. When one of the solar radiation region and the solar region is contaminated, the absolute value of the difference between the two power generation amounts is expected to be large to exceed the contamination determination value.</p>
<p id="p-0459" num="0471">Upon proceeding to step S<b>1040</b> as a result of determining that the absolute value of the difference is larger than the contamination determination value, the microcomputer <b>330</b> detects the rainfall amount using the rain sensor <b>313</b>. Thereafter, the microcomputer <b>330</b> proceeds to step S<b>1050</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0460" num="0472">In a strict sense, the rainfall amount detected by the rain sensor <b>313</b> corresponds to the water droplet adhered area in the rain region of the outer surface <b>372</b><i>a</i>. The rainfall amount can be determined to be larger with a higher ratio of the water droplet adhered area to the rain region.</p>
<p id="p-0461" num="0473">Upon proceeding to step S<b>1050</b>, the microcomputer <b>330</b> determines whether water droplets are adhering to the outer surface <b>372</b><i>a</i>, based on the rainfall amount detected by the rain sensor <b>313</b>. The determination on whether the water droplets are adhering can be made based on whether the rainfall amount is larger than the rainy weather determination value used in the sensor processing update processing described based on <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>25</b></figref> for example. When the rainfall amount is larger than the rainy weather determination value, the microcomputer <b>330</b> proceeds to step S<b>1060</b>. When the rainfall amount is equal to or smaller than the rainy weather determination value, the microcomputer <b>330</b> ends the wiping processing.</p>
<p id="p-0462" num="0474">Upon proceeding to step S<b>1060</b>, the microcomputer <b>330</b> drives the wiper <b>373</b>. As a result, the contaminant adhering to the outer surface <b>372</b><i>a </i>is expected to be wiped off together with the water droplets adhering to the outer surface <b>372</b><i>a. </i></p>
<p id="p-0463" num="0475">&#x3c;Operations and Effects&#x3e;</p>
<p id="p-0464" num="0476">As described above, the microcomputer <b>330</b> determines whether the outer surface <b>372</b><i>a </i>is contaminated. The microcomputer <b>330</b> determines whether water droplets are adhering to the outer surface <b>372</b><i>a</i>. When water droplets are adhering to the outer surface <b>372</b><i>a</i>, the microcomputer <b>330</b> drives the wiper <b>373</b>. On the other hand, when no water droplet is adhering to the outer surface <b>372</b><i>a</i>, the microcomputer <b>330</b> does not drive the wiper <b>373</b>. With the control thus executed, the contaminant adhering to the outer surface <b>372</b><i>a </i>is wiped off. Furthermore, the outer surface <b>372</b><i>a </i>is prevented from being scratched by the wiper <b>373</b> sliding.</p>
<p id="p-0465" num="0477">As described above, the monitoring unit <b>300</b> is provided in the open farm field <b>20</b>. It rains on the farm field <b>20</b>. Therefore, raindrops adhere to the outer surface <b>372</b><i>a </i>of the sensor case <b>370</b>. Furthermore, the irrigation water is supplied to the farm field <b>20</b>. When the sensor case <b>370</b> is located on the extension line of the direction (parabolic discharge direction) in which the irrigation water is discharged from the drip holes <b>137</b>, the irrigation water is highly likely to adhere to the outer surface <b>372</b><i>a. </i></p>
<p id="p-0466" num="0478">For example, with such a configuration, the water droplets for removing the contamination easily adheres to the outer surface <b>372</b><i>a </i>of the lid portion <b>372</b>, compared with a configuration where the sensor case <b>370</b> is simply provided on a roadside. The farm field <b>20</b> needs not to be provided with a dedicated injection mechanism for applying liquid, such as the irrigation water, onto the outer surface <b>372</b><i>a. </i></p>
<p id="p-0467" num="0479">It is a matter of course that a configuration may be employed in which the farm field <b>20</b> is provided with such an injection mechanism. Furthermore, a configuration may be employed in which the liquid discharged from the injection mechanism is selectively applied to a plurality of the sensor cases <b>370</b>. Which of the plurality of sensor cases <b>370</b> the liquid is applied can be determined based on, for example, how easily the irrigation water discharged from the drip holes <b>137</b> adheres to the outer surface <b>372</b><i>a </i>of the sensor cases <b>370</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0468" num="0480">A configuration may be employed in which the water spray nozzle described in the first embodiment is attached to the drip holes <b>137</b>, and the sensor case <b>370</b> is provided on the extension line of the parabolic injection direction of the irrigation water from the water spray nozzle. With this configuration, the water droplets for removing the contamination can adhere to the outer surface <b>372</b><i>a </i>of the sensor case <b>370</b>, by controlling the injection of the irrigation water from the water spray nozzle through opening/closing control on the water supply valves <b>152</b>. As described above, a configuration may be employed in which irrigation water is used for supplying water to the plants <b>30</b> and removing contamination on the outer surface <b>372</b><i>a </i>of the sensor case <b>370</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0469" num="0481">In the example described, the microcomputer <b>330</b> of each of the plurality of monitoring unit <b>300</b> executes the wiping processing. Alternatively, the integrated calculation unit <b>600</b> may execute the wiping processing. In this case, the integrated calculation unit <b>600</b> executes steps S<b>1010</b> to S<b>1050</b> for the wiping processing illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>34</b></figref> for each of the plurality of monitoring units <b>300</b>. Then, in step S<b>1060</b>, the integrated calculation unit <b>600</b> outputs an instruction signal including an instruction for operating the wiper to the monitoring unit <b>300</b>. The instruction for wiper operation corresponds to the driving instruction.</p>
<p id="p-0470" num="0482">&#x3c;Rain Sensor&#x3e;</p>
<p id="p-0471" num="0483">No specific configuration of the rain sensor <b>313</b> is described above. The rain sensor <b>313</b> can have the following configuration for example.</p>
<p id="p-0472" num="0484">Although not illustrated, the rain sensor <b>313</b> can have a configuration including a light emitting unit and a light receiving unit. The light emitting unit emits light from the inner surface <b>372</b><i>b </i>side toward the rain region of the outer surface <b>372</b><i>a</i>. The light receiving unit converts received light into an electrical signal.</p>
<p id="p-0473" num="0485">When no water droplet is adhering to the rain region, most of the light emitted from the light emitting unit is reflected at the interface between the outer surface <b>372</b><i>a </i>and the air. The reflected light is incident on the light receiving unit. In this case, the maximum amount of light is received by the light receiving unit. The light receiving unit outputs an electrical signal corresponding to this amount of light to the microcomputer <b>330</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0474" num="0486">However, when water droplets are adhering to the rain region, part of the light emitted from the light emitting unit travels from the outer surface <b>372</b><i>a </i>to the water droplet and is emitted to the outside from the water droplet. Therefore, this light is not received by the light receiving unit. The amount of light reflected at the interface between the outer surface <b>372</b><i>a </i>and air decreases, and the amount of light received by the light receiving unit decreases. An electrical signal corresponding to the reduced amount of light is output from the light receiving unit to the microcomputer <b>330</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0475" num="0487">As described above, when water droplets are adhering to the rain region, the electrical signal output from the light receiving unit varies. An increase in the water droplet adhered area in the rain region leads to a large amount of such change. Thus, the rain sensor <b>313</b> generates an electrical signal corresponding to the water droplet adhered area in the rain region.</p>
<p id="p-0476" num="0488">&#x3c;Rainfall Amount Detection Processing&#x3e;</p>
<p id="p-0477" num="0489">The accumulated rainfall amount can be further calculated with the rain sensor <b>313</b> and the wiper <b>373</b>. In this case, the microcomputer <b>330</b> executes rainfall amount detection processing illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>35</b></figref> as the cycle task.</p>
<p id="p-0478" num="0490">In step S<b>1110</b> illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>35</b></figref>, the microcomputer <b>330</b> acquires the output from the rain sensor <b>313</b>. Thereafter, the microcomputer <b>330</b> proceeds to step S<b>1120</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0479" num="0491">Upon proceeding to step S<b>1120</b>, the microcomputer <b>330</b> determines whether the water droplets are adhering to the rain region, based on the output from the rain sensor <b>313</b>. When water droplets are adhering to the rain region, the microcomputer <b>330</b> proceeds to step S<b>1130</b>. When no water droplet is adhering to the rain region, the microcomputer <b>330</b> proceeds to step S<b>1150</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0480" num="0492">Upon proceeding to step S<b>1130</b>, the microcomputer <b>330</b> starts operating the wiper <b>373</b>. As a result, water droplets adhering to the outer surface <b>372</b><i>a </i>are removed. In this case, the microcomputer <b>330</b> executes the processing in step S<b>1140</b>. Specifically, the microcomputer <b>330</b> starts a counter and counts the number of times the outer surface <b>372</b><i>a </i>is wiped by the wiper <b>373</b>. Thereafter, the microcomputer <b>330</b> proceeds to step S<b>1150</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0481" num="0493">Upon proceeding to step S<b>1150</b>, the microcomputer <b>330</b> determines whether monitor time has elapsed. When the monitor time has elapsed, the microcomputer <b>330</b> proceeds to step S<b>1160</b>. When the monitor time has not elapsed yet, the microcomputer <b>330</b> repeats steps S<b>1110</b> to S<b>1150</b>. As a result, whether the water droplets are adhering continues to be determined during the monitor time. The wiping by the wiper <b>373</b> is continued during the monitoring time, and the number of times the wiping is performed with the wiper <b>373</b> is measured.</p>
<p id="p-0482" num="0494">Upon proceeding to step S<b>1160</b>, the microcomputer <b>330</b> calculates the accumulated rainfall amount within the monitor time, based on the water droplet adhered area detected by the rain sensor <b>313</b>, the number of times the wiping is performed by the wiper <b>373</b> during the monitor time. Then, the microcomputer <b>330</b> outputs rain information including the accumulated rainfall amount from the communication unit <b>340</b> to the integrated communication unit <b>400</b>.</p>

<p id="p-0496" num="0508">As disclosed in JP-3444192B, an imaging environment estimation device included in a vehicle automatic driving system of a vehicle has been known.</p>
<p id="p-0497" num="0509">The imaging environment estimation device described in the above publication calculates an approximate straight line based on a distance between a white line extending away from a vehicle on a road and an image capturing device and the level of blurring of the white line in the captured image. Then, the imaging environment estimation device discriminates between fog and rainfall based on the magnitude of the inclination of the approximate straight line.</p>
<p id="p-0498" num="0510">Since such determination is performed, when there is no white line extending away from the vehicle as the detection target, the approximate straight line for discriminating between fog and rainfall cannot be calculated. Thus, fog might not be detectable.</p>
<p id="p-0499" num="0511">An object of the present disclosure is to provide a monitoring unit capable of detecting fog.</p>

<p id="p-0509" num="0521">As illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>38</b></figref>, the monitoring unit <b>300</b> of the present embodiment includes a first sensor case <b>375</b>, a second sensor case <b>376</b>, and a coupling case <b>377</b>. The first sensor case <b>375</b> and the second sensor case <b>376</b> are arranged in the z direction with the coupling case <b>377</b> provided in between. The first sensor case <b>375</b> and the second sensor case <b>376</b> are mechanically connected to each other via the coupling case <b>377</b>. A part of these three members may be integrally connected by resin molding or the like.</p>
<p id="p-0510" num="0522">The first sensor case <b>375</b> stores components other than the solar cell <b>361</b> among the components of the control unit <b>320</b>. As illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>39</b></figref>, the camera <b>318</b> is stored in the first sensor case <b>375</b>. As illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>40</b></figref>, the second sensor case <b>376</b> stores the solar radiation sensor <b>312</b> and the solar cell <b>361</b>. The member stored in the first sensor case <b>375</b> and the member stored in the second sensor case <b>376</b> are electrically connected to each other via wiring or the like extending via the coupling case <b>377</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0511" num="0523">In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>40</b></figref>, the microcomputer <b>330</b>, the solar cell <b>361</b>, and the current sensor <b>363</b> among the components of the control unit <b>320</b> are illustrated. The microcomputer <b>330</b> and the current sensor <b>363</b> are stored in the first sensor case <b>375</b>, and in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>40</b></figref>, the positions where they are projected onto the second sensor case <b>376</b> along the z direction are indicated by broken lines.</p>
<p id="p-0512" num="0524">The first sensor case <b>375</b> includes a cylindrical first housing <b>378</b> and a first lid portion <b>379</b> that closes an opening of the first housing <b>378</b>. The first housing <b>378</b> has a bottom portion and a side wall. The bottom portion has two surfaces arranged in the z direction. The side wall stands in the z direction from one surface located on the sky side of the two surfaces. The side wall also extends annularly in the circumferential direction around the z direction. An opening of the first housing <b>378</b> is defined on the distal end side of the side wall.</p>
<p id="p-0513" num="0525">The first lid portion <b>379</b> has a lower surface on the first sensor case <b>375</b> side and an upper surface <b>379</b><i>a </i>on the opposite side, arranged in z direction. The first lid portion <b>379</b> is connected to the first housing <b>378</b>, to have a first lower surface face the bottom portion of the first housing <b>378</b> in the z direction. The first lid portion <b>379</b> closes the opening of the first housing <b>378</b>. The upper surface <b>379</b><i>a </i>corresponds to the second surface.</p>
<p id="p-0514" num="0526">A through hole is formed through the lower surface and the upper surface <b>379</b><i>a </i>in the z direction, in the first lid portion <b>379</b>. The camera <b>318</b> is provided in the through hole. The distal end side of the camera <b>318</b> protrudes from the opening of the through hole on the upper surface <b>379</b><i>a </i>side. The camera <b>318</b> captures an image on the upper side of the upper surface <b>379</b><i>a. </i></p>
<p id="p-0515" num="0527">In the present embodiment, the position where the through hole, in which the camera <b>318</b> is provided, is formed in the upper surface <b>379</b><i>a </i>is different from the geometric center of the upper surface <b>379</b><i>a</i>. Alternatively, these may be at the same positions.</p>
<p id="p-0516" num="0528">In the present embodiment, the upper surface <b>379</b><i>a </i>is flat. Alternatively, the upper surface <b>379</b><i>a </i>may not be flat. For example, the upper surface <b>379</b><i>a </i>may protrude in the z direction away from the first housing <b>378</b>, with the opening position of the through hole serving as the apex. In such a configuration, even if water droplets are adhering to the upper surface <b>379</b><i>a</i>, the water droplets easily flow down on the upper surface <b>379</b><i>a </i>so as to be separated from the camera <b>318</b> provided in the through hole.</p>
<p id="p-0517" num="0529">The upper surface <b>379</b><i>a </i>may be configured to have higher wettability than the portion of the camera <b>318</b> protruding from the opening of the through hole on the upper surface <b>379</b><i>a </i>side. In other words, the portion of the camera <b>318</b> protruding from the opening of the through hole on the upper surface <b>379</b><i>a </i>side may be configured to have higher water repellency than the upper surface <b>379</b><i>a</i>. With such a configuration, the state where the water droplets are adhering to the camera <b>318</b> is less likely to be maintained. Furthermore, the upper surface <b>379</b><i>a </i>may be provided with a dedicated wiper for wiping the lens of the camera <b>318</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0518" num="0530">The second sensor case <b>376</b> includes a cylindrical second housing <b>380</b> and a second lid portion <b>381</b> that closes an opening of the second housing <b>380</b>. The second housing <b>380</b> has a bottom portion and a side wall. The bottom portion has a lower outer surface <b>380</b><i>b </i>and a lower inner surface on the opposite side that are arranged in the z direction. The side wall stands in the z direction from the lower inner surface. At the same time, the side wall extends annularly in the circumferential direction around the z direction. An opening of the second housing <b>380</b> is defined on the distal end side of the side wall. The lower outer surface <b>380</b><i>b </i>corresponds to the first surface.</p>
<p id="p-0519" num="0531">The second lid portion <b>381</b> includes an upper outer surface <b>381</b><i>a </i>and an upper inner surface on the opposite side, arranged in the z direction. The second lid portion <b>381</b> is connected to the second housing <b>380</b> to have the upper inner surface face the lower inner surface of the bottom portion in the z direction. The second lid portion <b>381</b> closes the opening of the second housing <b>380</b>. The internal space of the second sensor case <b>376</b> is located between the upper inner surface of the second lid portion <b>381</b> and the lower inner surface of the bottom portion in the z direction.</p>
<p id="p-0520" num="0532">The second housing <b>380</b> and the second lid portion <b>381</b> are translucent. Thus, light incident on the upper outer surface <b>381</b><i>a </i>of the second lid portion <b>381</b> enters the inside of the second lid portion <b>381</b> through the upper outer surface <b>381</b><i>a</i>. The light propagates inside the second lid portion <b>381</b>, and then is emitted into the internal space of the second sensor case <b>376</b> from the upper inner surface. On the other hand, the light incident on the lower outer surface <b>380</b><i>b </i>of the bottom portion of the second housing <b>380</b> enters the inside of the bottom portion through the lower outer surface <b>380</b><i>b</i>. The light propagates inside the bottom portion, and then is emitted into the internal space of the second sensor case <b>376</b> from the lower inner surface. Alternatively, the light propagates in the bottom portion and the side wall, and then enters the inside of the second lid portion <b>381</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0521" num="0533">The solar radiation sensor <b>312</b> and the solar cell <b>361</b> are each arranged to face the upper inner surface of the second lid portion <b>381</b> in the z direction. Therefore, the light emitted into the internal space of the second sensor case <b>376</b> from the upper inner surface is incident on each of the solar radiation sensor <b>312</b> and the solar cell <b>361</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0522" num="0534">As illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>40</b></figref>, an upper wiper <b>382</b> is provided on the upper outer surface <b>381</b><i>a </i>side of the second lid portion <b>381</b>. As illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>41</b></figref>, a lower wiper <b>383</b> is provided on the lower outer surface <b>380</b><i>b </i>side of the second housing <b>380</b>. The second sensor case <b>376</b> is provided with the motor <b>374</b> for driving each of the upper wiper <b>382</b> and the lower wiper <b>383</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0523" num="0535">The upper wiper <b>382</b> driven by the motor <b>374</b> slides on the upper outer surface <b>381</b><i>a</i>. The lower wiper <b>383</b> driven by the motor <b>374</b> slides on the lower outer surface <b>380</b><i>b</i>. As a result, water droplets and the contaminants adhering to the upper outer surface <b>381</b><i>a </i>and the lower outer surface <b>380</b><i>b </i>are wiped off.</p>
<p id="p-0524" num="0536">As illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>38</b> and <b>39</b></figref>, a positional relationship between the second sensor case <b>376</b> and the first sensor case <b>375</b> is determined with the coupling case <b>377</b>, such that the lower outer surface <b>380</b><i>b </i>of the second sensor case <b>376</b> and the upper surface <b>379</b><i>a </i>of the first sensor case <b>375</b> face each other while being separated from each other in the z direction.</p>
<p id="p-0525" num="0537">As described above, the first sensor case <b>375</b> is provided with the camera <b>318</b> that captures an image on the upper side of the upper surface <b>379</b><i>a</i>. The camera <b>318</b> faces the lower outer surface <b>380</b><i>b </i>of the second sensor case <b>376</b> in the z direction. Furthermore, the camera <b>318</b> and the translucent upper outer surface <b>381</b><i>a </i>of the second sensor case <b>376</b> are arranged in the z direction. The camera <b>318</b> can capture an image including part of each of the lower outer surface <b>380</b><i>b </i>and the upper outer surface <b>381</b><i>a. </i></p>
<p id="p-0526" num="0538">Note that air may or may not be present in a region between the lower outer surface <b>380</b><i>b </i>and the upper outer surface <b>381</b><i>a </i>located within the viewing angle of the camera <b>318</b>. The configuration with no air in the region between the lower outer surface <b>380</b><i>b </i>and the upper outer surface <b>381</b><i>a </i>located within the viewing angle can be achieved, for example, by filling the region between the lower inner surface of the bottom portion of the second housing <b>380</b> and the upper inner surface of the second lid portion <b>381</b> located with the viewing angle with a translucent material. As the translucent material, for example, a material for forming the second housing <b>380</b> or the second lid portion <b>381</b> can be used. The region between the lower inner surface and the upper inner surface located within the viewing angle may be filled with part of the second housing <b>380</b> or the second lid portion <b>381</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0527" num="0539">In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>40</b> and <b>41</b></figref>, a region (image capturing region SA) of image capturing by the camera <b>318</b> is defined by a one-dot chain line. The image capturing region SA is separated from each of the solar radiation sensor <b>312</b>, the solar cell <b>361</b>, and the motor <b>374</b> stored in the second sensor case <b>376</b>, in a direction orthogonal to the z direction. The image capturing region SA is separated, in a direction orthogonal to the z direction, from each of the solar radiation region of the upper outer surface <b>381</b><i>a </i>through which the light incident on the solar radiation sensor <b>312</b> is expected to pass and the solar region of the upper outer surface <b>381</b><i>a </i>through which the light incident on the solar cell <b>361</b> is expected to pass.</p>
<p id="p-0528" num="0540">As illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>41</b></figref>, a fog symbol <b>384</b> as a reference image is provided in the image capturing region SA in the lower outer surface <b>380</b><i>b</i>. The camera <b>318</b> is focused on the fog symbol <b>384</b>. Therefore, when no water droplet or the like is adhering to the lower outer surface <b>380</b><i>b</i>, the image of the fog symbol <b>384</b> captured by the camera <b>318</b> is in focus. However, when waters droplet and the like are adhering to the lower outer surface <b>380</b><i>b</i>, the image of the fog symbol <b>384</b> captured by the camera <b>318</b> defocused due to irregular reflection of light caused by the water droplets.</p>
<p id="p-0529" num="0541">As illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>38</b> and <b>39</b></figref>, the coupling case <b>377</b> includes a support portion <b>385</b> and an eaves portion <b>386</b>. The support portion <b>385</b> has a cylindrical shape with the axial direction in the z direction. Two bottom surfaces of the support portion <b>385</b> arranged in the z direction are open. The support portion <b>385</b> has an upper annular end surface and a lower annular end surface extending annularly in the circumferential direction around the z direction as part of these two bottom surfaces.</p>
<p id="p-0530" num="0542">The upper annular end surface of the support portion <b>385</b> is arranged to face the edge side of the lower outer surface <b>380</b><i>b </i>of the second sensor case <b>376</b> in the z direction. The support portion <b>385</b> and the second sensor case <b>376</b> are mechanically connected by an adhesive, fitting, or the like.</p>
<p id="p-0531" num="0543">The lower annular end surface of the support portion <b>385</b> is arranged to face the edge side of the upper surface <b>379</b><i>a </i>of the first sensor case <b>375</b> in the z direction. The support portion <b>385</b> and the first sensor case <b>375</b> are mechanically connected by an adhesive, fitting, or the like.</p>
<p id="p-0532" num="0544">The support portion <b>385</b> has an inner side surface <b>385</b><i>a </i>and an outer side surface <b>385</b><i>b </i>of an annular shape, connecting the upper annular end surface and the lower annular end surface. The inner side surface <b>385</b><i>a </i>defines a hollow space of the support portion <b>385</b>. The hollow space is located between the lower outer surface <b>380</b><i>b </i>of the second sensor case <b>376</b> and the upper surface <b>379</b><i>a </i>of the first sensor case <b>375</b> in the z direction. The outer side surface <b>385</b><i>b </i>is exposed to an outer atmosphere.</p>
<p id="p-0533" num="0545">As illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>39</b></figref>, in the support portion <b>385</b>, a communication window <b>385</b><i>c </i>is formed through the inner side surface <b>385</b><i>a </i>and the outer side surface <b>385</b><i>b </i>and communicates the hollow space of the support portion <b>385</b> with the outer atmosphere. The communication window <b>385</b><i>c </i>opens in a direction orthogonal to the z direction. That is, the communication window <b>385</b><i>c </i>opens in the horizontal direction. At least part of the hollow space of the support portion <b>385</b> corresponds to the opposing space.</p>
<p id="p-0534" num="0546">As illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>38</b></figref>, the eaves portion <b>386</b> is provided on the support portion <b>385</b> so as to cover the communication window <b>385</b><i>c</i>. A communication hole <b>386</b><i>a </i>having a smaller opening area than the communication window <b>385</b><i>c </i>is formed in the eaves portion <b>386</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0535" num="0547">The communication hole <b>386</b><i>a </i>is open on the ground side in the z direction. The communication hole <b>386</b><i>a </i>communicates with the communication window <b>385</b><i>c</i>. With this configuration, the outside air flowing from the ground side toward the eaves portion <b>386</b> flows into the hollow space of the support portion <b>385</b> through the communication hole <b>386</b><i>a </i>and the communication window <b>385</b><i>c</i>. On the other hand, the eaves portion <b>386</b> prevents raindrops or the like falling from the sky side onto the eaves portion <b>386</b>, from entering the hollow space of the support portion <b>385</b> through the communication window <b>385</b><i>c. </i></p>
<p id="p-0536" num="0548">The configuration of the communication path between the communication hole <b>386</b><i>a </i>and the communication window <b>385</b><i>c </i>is not particularly limited. Any configuration that can prevent liquid such as rainwater from entering the communication window <b>385</b><i>c </i>through the communication hole <b>386</b><i>a </i>can be employed as the configuration of the communication path. As a specific configuration of the communication path, a configuration may be employed with a labyrinth structure in which the path extends while being folded back at least once to have a long path length for example.</p>
<p id="p-0537" num="0549">The hollow space of the support portion <b>385</b> is located between the upper surface <b>379</b><i>a </i>of the first sensor case <b>375</b> and the lower outer surface <b>380</b><i>b </i>of the second sensor case <b>376</b> in the z direction. Therefore, the camera <b>318</b> provided on the upper surface <b>379</b><i>a </i>and the fog symbol <b>384</b> provided on the lower outer surface <b>380</b><i>b </i>are provided in the hollow space of the support portion <b>385</b>. Each of the camera <b>318</b> and the fog symbol <b>384</b> is exposed to the outside air flowing into the hollow space of the support portion <b>385</b> through the communication hole <b>386</b><i>a </i>and the communication window <b>385</b><i>c. </i></p>
<p id="p-0538" num="0550">For example, when fog appears in the farm field <b>20</b>, outside air containing a large amount of moisture flows into the hollow space of the support portion <b>385</b>. As a result, dew condensation occurs on the lower outer surface <b>380</b><i>b </i>provided with the fog symbol <b>384</b>. When the camera <b>318</b> captures an image of the fog symbol <b>384</b> on the lower outer surface <b>380</b><i>b </i>to which the water droplets are adhering due to the dew condensation, a defocused image of the fog symbol <b>384</b> is acquired due to diffused reflection of light caused by the water droplets.</p>
<p id="p-0539" num="0551">On the other hand, when the rain falls on the farm field <b>20</b>, raindrops are prevented from entering the hollow space of the support portion <b>385</b>. Only the outside air containing some moisture flows into the hollow space of the support portion <b>385</b>. Therefore, adhering of water droplets to the lower outer surface <b>380</b><i>b </i>provided with the fog symbol <b>384</b> is prevented. When the camera <b>318</b> captures an image of the fog symbol <b>384</b> on the lower outer surface <b>380</b><i>b </i>the adhering of water droplets on which is prevented, an in-focus image of the fog symbol <b>384</b> is acquired.</p>
