<p id="p-0002" num="0001">The present invention relates to the technical field of pet feeders, and in particular, to a variable-capacity pet feeder.</p>
<heading id="h-0002" level="1">BACKGROUND OF THE DISCLOSURE</heading>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">With the continuous improvement of residents' living standards, a growing number of domestic urban residents keep pets. Pets have become indispensable good companions for many old people, children and even workers, and also become people's spiritual ballast to relax. However, in real life, since no special person takes care of or feeds pets in most of families, pet owners' going out early and coming home late makes pets have to eat in a hurry only in the morning and in the evening but have nothing to eat when they are hungry at home. It is convenient to buy pets, but raising pets is not an easy task. Especially when people go out for business or tourism, they usually cannot take timely and good care of pets at home, so feeding pets has become an outstanding problem that puzzles people. Therefore, automatic pet feeders have emerged.</p>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">However, existing pet feeders generally have an invariable capacity, so that a user can only buy an invariable-capacity pet feeder and store pet food in the invariable-capacity pet feeder during use, causing inconvenience to food storage.</p>
<heading id="h-0003" level="1">SUMMARY OF THE DISCLOSURE</heading>

<p id="p-0026" num="0025">This embodiment relates to a variable-capacity pet feeder. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref> and <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref>, the pet feeder includes: a discharge assembly <b>2</b>, expansion buckets <b>5</b>, an accommodating bucket <b>4</b>, and detachment members.</p>
<p id="p-0027" num="0026">The discharge assembly <b>2</b> communicates with the accommodating bucket <b>4</b>. The discharge assembly <b>2</b> is configured to control food in the accommodating bucket <b>4</b> to fall or stop falling. A plurality of expansion buckets <b>5</b> are provided. Clamping slots <b>41</b> are provided on the tops of the expansion buckets <b>5</b> and the top of the accommodating bucket <b>4</b>. One detachment member is disposed at each of joints of adjacent expansion buckets <b>5</b> and the accommodating bucket <b>4</b>. The detachment member includes a clamping block <b>51</b> and the clamping slot <b>41</b> for clamping the clamping block <b>51</b>. The clamping blocks <b>51</b> are disposed at the bottom of the expansion bucket <b>5</b>. Between the expansion buckets <b>5</b> or between the expansion bucket <b>5</b> and the accommodating bucket <b>4</b>, through the cooperation of the clamping blocks <b>51</b> and the clamping slots <b>41</b>, the expansion buckets <b>5</b> communicate with the accommodating bucket <b>4</b>, so that the expansion buckets <b>5</b> are detachably stacked at an end of the accommodating bucket <b>4</b> away from the discharge assembly <b>2</b>, to implement an expansion function. In this embodiment, an upper cover <b>6</b> is disposed at the top of the accommodating bucket <b>4</b> or on the expansion bucket <b>5</b>, an insertion part <b>62</b> is disposed on the upper cover <b>6</b>, and the insertion part <b>62</b> is a detachment member, so that the upper cover <b>6</b> can cover the accommodating bucket <b>4</b> or cover the stacked expansion buckets <b>5</b>, to improve sealing performance of the entire apparatus and implement effects of preventing dust, insects and dampness. The discharge assembly <b>2</b> is intelligently controlled and can start to spread food regularly and can also control the amount of spread food. In other embodiments, the discharge assembly <b>2</b> is manual. A telescopic apparatus is disposed between the expansion bucket <b>5</b> and the accommodating bucket <b>4</b>. The telescopic apparatus is configured to increase or decrease a size of a space between the expansion bucket <b>5</b> and the accommodating bucket <b>4</b>, to implement an expansion function. The telescopic apparatus may be a manually stretched or electric pull rope.</p>
<p id="p-0028" num="0027">Preferably, the connector <b>3</b> includes: a clamping ring <b>31</b>, a first clamping part <b>32</b>, and a second clamping part <b>33</b>.

When this apparatus is not used for a long time, the accommodating bucket <b>4</b> can be detached and cleaned, and the accommodating bucket <b>4</b> can serve as a food storage bucket to store the pet food after being detached, to implement multiple functions.</p>
<p id="p-0029" num="0028">Preferably, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref>, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref>, and <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b></figref>, the discharge assembly <b>2</b> includes: a food guide base <b>21</b> and a discharge member.</p>
<p id="p-0030" num="0029">The food guide base <b>21</b> is disposed at the bottom of the accommodating bucket <b>4</b>. A discharge frame <b>211</b> communicating with the accommodating bucket <b>4</b> is disposed on the food guide base <b>21</b>. The discharge member is disposed in the food guide base <b>21</b>. The discharge member is configured to control food in the accommodating bucket <b>4</b> to fall or stop falling. In this embodiment, the food guide base <b>21</b> and the accommodating bucket <b>4</b> are detachably assembled, so that this apparatus is convenient to detach, clean, and replace. A base is disposed at the bottom of the food guide base <b>21</b>. The base <b>11</b> is configured to support the entire apparatus. A food guide plate <b>22</b> is disposed on a side face of the food guide base <b>21</b>. The food guide plate <b>22</b> is inclined, with a higher end disposed below a discharge position of the discharge assembly <b>2</b>. A food dish <b>1</b> is disposed on the food guide base <b>21</b> in an oblique direction, and the food dish <b>1</b> is concave inward and configured to accommodate the pet food. A lower end of the food guide plate <b>22</b> faces toward the food dish <b>1</b>. The pet food slides into the food dish <b>1</b> by using the food guide base <b>21</b> and is prevented from easily falling out of the food dish <b>1</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0031" num="0030">Preferably, the discharge member includes: a partition plate <b>233</b>, a motor <b>231</b>, and a rotation plate <b>235</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0032" num="0031">The partition plate <b>233</b> is fixedly disposed in the discharge frame <b>211</b>. The partition plate <b>233</b> is fixedly disposed in the food guide base <b>21</b>. A first food leaking hole <b>234</b> and a through-hole are provided in the partition plate <b>233</b> and fixedly provided at the bottom of the partition plate <b>233</b>. An output shaft of the motor <b>231</b> penetrates through the through-hole. One side of the rotation plate <b>235</b> is fixedly disposed at an end of the discharge frame <b>211</b> away from the accommodating bucket <b>4</b>, and the other side of the rotation plate <b>235</b> is closely attached to the partition plate <b>233</b>. The rotation plate <b>235</b> is connected to the output shaft of the motor <b>231</b>. A second food leaking hole <b>237</b> that corresponds to the first food leaking hole <b>234</b> is provided in the rotation plate <b>235</b>. An annular groove is provided in an outer edge of the partition plate <b>233</b>. The rotation plate <b>235</b> is rotationally disposed in the annular groove. A diameter of the rotation plate <b>235</b> is greater than or equal to a diameter of the discharge frame <b>211</b> and less than a diameter of the annular groove. When the diameter of the rotation plate <b>235</b> is greater than the diameter of the discharge frame <b>211</b> and less than the diameter of the annular groove and the motor <b>231</b> rotates, the output shaft drives the rotation plate <b>235</b> to rotate in the annular groove. When the second food leaking hole <b>237</b> of the rotation plate <b>235</b> overlaps the first food leaking hole <b>234</b> of the partition plate <b>233</b>, the pet food falls out of the accommodating bucket <b>4</b>. When the motor <b>231</b> continues to rotate, the second food leaking hole <b>237</b> and the first food leaking hole <b>234</b> are staggered, so that the pet food stops falling. In this embodiment, a mounting sleeve <b>236</b> is provided on the rotation plate <b>235</b>, and the output shaft of the motor <b>231</b> and the mounting sleeve <b>236</b> on the rotation plate <b>235</b> are assembled in a clamped manner, so that the motor <b>231</b> and the rotation plate <b>235</b> are convenient to detach. A fastening rod <b>232</b> for fastening the motor <b>231</b> is disposed at the bottom of the partition plate <b>233</b>.</p>
