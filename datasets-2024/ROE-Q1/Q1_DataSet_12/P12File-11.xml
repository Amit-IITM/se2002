<?summary-of-invention description="Summary of Invention" end="lead"?>
<p id="p-0002" num="0001">This nonprovisional application is based on Japanese Patent Application No. 2022-004976 filed on Jan. 17, 2022 with the Japan Patent Office, the entire contents of which are hereby incorporated by reference.</p>
<heading id="h-0001" level="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<heading id="h-0002" level="1">Field of the Invention</heading>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">The present invention relates to a shoe sole including a resilient member and a shoe including the shoe sole.</p>
<heading id="h-0003" level="1">Description of the Background Art</heading>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">A shoe sole including a shock absorber and a shoe including the shoe sole have conventionally been known. The shock absorber is provided in the shoe sole for the purpose of alleviating the impact received on contact with the ground, and is generally often formed of a solid body or a hollow body made of resin or rubber.</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">For example, U.S. Patent Publication No. 2020/0281313 discloses a shoe configured such that a shock absorber formed of a hollow body made of resin is disposed between a highly rigid plate embedded in a shoe sole and an outsole defining a ground contact surface of the shoe sole.</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">In recent years, there has been developed a shoe having a shoe sole including an area having a lattice structure or a web structure to thereby enhance the shock absorbing performance in terms not only of material but also of structure. A shoe having a shoe sole including an area having a lattice structure is disclosed, for example, in U.S. Patent Publication No. 2018/0049514.</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">Further, Japanese National Patent Publication No. 2017-527637 explains that a three-dimensional object manufactured by a three-dimensional additive manufacturing method can be manufactured by adding a thickness to a geometrical surface structure, such as a polyhedron or a triply periodic minimal surface having a cavity therein, and discloses that the three-dimensional object is formed of an elastic material and thereby can be applicable as a shock absorber, for example, to a shoe sole.</p>
<heading id="h-0004" level="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">This type of shock absorber exhibits a shock absorbing function when a load is applied to the shock absorber (i.e., when a foot comes into contact with the ground). Thus, conventionally, shock absorbers have been developed for the purpose of maximizing the shock absorbing performance during application of load.</p>
<p id="p-0009" num="0008">On the other hand, shock absorbers exhibit a resilience function during reduction of load (i.e., when a foot pushes off from the ground). Thus, if the resilience performance achieved during reduction of load can be maximized while applying a shock absorber as a resilient member, high propulsive force can be achieved during running.</p>
<p id="p-0010" num="0009">However, conventionally, the above-described attempt has actually hardly been taken into consideration. In particular, a shoe sole enhanced in resilience performance in terms not only of material but also of structure and a shoe including the shoe sole have not sufficiently been put into practical use.</p>
<p id="p-0011" num="0010">Thus, the present invention has been made in view of the above-described problem, and it is an object of the present invention to provide: a shoe sole including a resilient member enhanced in resilience performance to allow high propulsive force to be achieved during running; and a shoe including the shoe sole.</p>
<p id="p-0012" num="0011">A shoe sole according to the present invention includes a resilient member and has a bottom surface serving as a ground contact surface and a top surface located opposite to the bottom surface. The resilient member has a three-dimensional shape formed by a wall having an outer shape defined by a pair of parallel flat or curved surfaces, and may buckle when the resilient member receives a compressive stress applied in a normal direction to the bottom surface. In the shoe sole according to the present invention, when a load is applied to the shoe sole in a gradually increasing manner such that a compressive stress is applied to the resilient member in the normal direction, the resilient member starts to buckle in a state in which a stress applied to the resilient member is within a range of 0.05 MPa or more and 0.55 MPa or less and a strain of the resilient member in the normal direction is within a range of 10% or more and 60% or less.</p>
<p id="p-0013" num="0012">A shoe according to the present invention includes: the shoe sole according to the present invention; and an upper provided above the shoe sole.</p>
<p id="p-0014" num="0013">The foregoing and other objects, features, aspects and advantages of the present invention will become more apparent from the following detailed description of the present invention when taken in conjunction with the accompanying drawings.</p>

<heading id="h-0006" level="1">DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS</heading>
<p id="p-0052" num="0051">The following describes embodiments of the present invention in detail with reference to the accompanying drawings. In the embodiments described below, the same or common portions are denoted by the same reference characters, and the description thereof will not be repeated.</p>
<p id="p-0053" num="0052">&#x3c;Resilient Member Having Basically the Same Structure as Resilient Member Included in Shoe Sole According to Embodiment&#x3e;</p>
<p id="p-0054" num="0053"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b>A</figref> is a perspective view of a resilient member having basically the same structure as a resilient member included in a shoe sole according to an embodiment, and <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b>B</figref> is a perspective view of a unit structure body forming the resilient member. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b>A</figref> is a plan view of the resilient member shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b>A</figref> when viewed in a direction indicated by an arrow HA shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b>A</figref>, and <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>2</b>B and <b>2</b>C</figref> are cross-sectional views taken along lines IIB-IIB and IIC-IIC, respectively, shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b>A</figref>. Before describing a shoe sole according to the present embodiment and a shoe including the shoe sole, the following describes a configuration of a resilient member <b>1</b>A conforming in structure to the resilient member included in the shoe sole with reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>1</b>A, <b>1</b>B, and <b>2</b>A to <b>2</b>C</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0055" num="0054">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>1</b>A and <b>2</b>A to <b>2</b>C</figref>, the resilient member <b>1</b>A includes a three-dimensional structure S having a plurality of unit structure bodies U. Each of the plurality of unit structure bodies U has a three-dimensional shape formed by a wall <b>10</b> having an outer shape defined by a pair of parallel flat surfaces (see <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b>B</figref>). Thereby, the three-dimensional structure S also has a three-dimensional shape formed by the wall <b>10</b> having an outer shape defined by a pair of parallel flat surfaces.</p>
<p id="p-0056" num="0055">The unit structure body U has a structure obtained by adding a thickness to a base structure unit having a geometrical surface structure. More specifically, the unit structure body U is formed by adding a thickness to each of divided structure units obtained by dividing a structure unit into two in one of its orthogonal three-axis directions, the structure unit being formed of a plurality of flat surfaces disposed to intersect with each other so as to be hollow inside.</p>
<p id="p-0057" num="0056">In this case, in the unit structure body U shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b>B</figref>, the above-mentioned surface structure is a Kelvin structure, and the unit structure body U is formed by adding a thickness to each of divided structure units obtained by dividing a structure unit having a Kelvin structure into two in a height direction (in a Z-axis direction shown in the figure) among the orthogonal three-axis directions.</p>
<p id="p-0058" num="0057">More specifically, the unit structure body U includes; one upper wall portion <b>11</b>; four divided lower wall portions <b>12</b>&#x2032;; and four upright wall portions <b>13</b> each connecting the upper wall portion <b>11</b> and a corresponding one of the lower wall portions <b>12</b>&#x2032;. Each of the upright wall portions <b>13</b> extends to intersect with the upper wall portion <b>11</b> and a corresponding one of the lower wall portions <b>12</b>&#x2032;, and is connected on its both side ends to adjacent upright wall portions <b>13</b>. Thus, the four upright wall portions <b>13</b> entirely form an annular shape. Note that each of the upper wall portion <b>11</b>, the lower wall portions <b>12</b>&#x2032;, and the upright wall portions <b>13</b> has a flat plate shape.</p>
<p id="p-0059" num="0058">Each of the four divided lower wall portions <b>12</b>&#x2032; included in one unit structure body U is arranged continuously to, and thereby integrated with, one of the lower wall portions <b>12</b>&#x2032; included in another unit structure body U adjacent to the one unit structure body U. Thus, in the three-dimensional structure S, each of the lower wall portions <b>12</b>&#x2032; included in each of four unit structure bodies U adjacent to each other is arranged continuously to an adjacent lower wall portion <b>12</b>&#x2032; included in a corresponding one of these four unit structure bodies U, to thereby form one lower wall portion <b>12</b> substantially similar in shape to the above-mentioned one upper wall portion <b>11</b> (see <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b>A</figref> and the like).</p>
<p id="p-0060" num="0059">The resilient member <b>1</b>A according to the present embodiment is intended to exhibit a resilience function in the above-mentioned height direction. Thus, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>1</b>A and <b>2</b>A to <b>2</b>C</figref>, the plurality of unit structure bodies U are repeatedly arranged in a regular and continuous manner in each of a width direction (an X direction shown in the figure) and a depth direction (a Y direction shown in the figure) among the orthogonal three-axis directions. Thereby, the three-dimensional structure S has a structure in which upward protruding portions and downward protruding portions are alternately arranged in a plan view. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>1</b>A and <b>2</b>A to <b>2</b>C</figref> each show only three unit structure bodies U arranged adjacent to each other in the width direction and the depth direction.</p>
<p id="p-0061" num="0060">In this case, in the illustrative description of the present embodiment, the resilient member <b>1</b>A is formed of a large number of unit structure bodies U arranged in the width direction and the depth direction, but the number of unit structure bodies U repeatedly arranged in the width direction and the depth direction is not particularly limited. Specifically, the resilient member may be formed by arranging two or more unit structure bodies U in only one of the width direction and the depth direction, or may be formed of only a single unit structure body U.</p>
<p id="p-0062" num="0061">While a method of manufacturing the resilient member <b>1</b>A is not particularly limited, the resilient member <b>1</b>A can be manufactured, for example, by molding such as injection molding using a mold, cast molding, sheet molding, additive manufacturing using a three-dimensional additive manufacturing apparatus; or the like. In particular, the above-described resilient member <b>1</b>A has a relatively simple shape, and therefore, can be manufactured easily by molding using a mold. This eliminates the need to perform additive manufacturing using a three-dimensional additive manufacturing apparatus or molding using a complicated mold, so that the manufacturing cost can be significantly reduced. Further, by manufacturing the resilient member <b>1</b>A by molding using a mold, the resilient member <b>1</b>A can be manufactured even with a material type by which the resilient member <b>1</b>A cannot be manufactured by additive manufacturing using a three-dimensional additive manufacturing apparatus. This increases the degree of freedom for material selection, and thus, a resilient member having higher resilience performance can be implemented.</p>
<p id="p-0063" num="0062">The material of the resilient member <b>1</b>A may be basically any material as long as it has appropriate elastic force, but is preferably a resin material or a rubber material. More specifically, when the resilient member <b>1</b>A is made of resin, for example, the material of the resilient member <b>1</b>A may be a polyolefin resin, ethylene-vinyl acetate copolymer (EVA), polyamide-based thermoplastic elastomer (TPA, TPAE), thermoplastic polyurethane (TPU), and polyester-based thermoplastic elastomer (TPEE). On the other hand, when the resilient member <b>1</b>A is made of rubber, for example, butadiene rubber may be used.</p>
<p id="p-0064" num="0063">The resilient member <b>1</b>A can be formed of a polymer composition. In that case, examples of polymer to be contained in the polymer composition include olefinic polymers such as olefinic elastomers and olefinic resins. Examples of the olefinic polymers include polyolefins such as polyethylene (e.g., linear low density polyethylene (LLDPE), high density polyethylene (HDPE), and the like), polypropylene, ethylene-propylene copolymer, propylene-1-hexene copolymer, propylene-4-methyl-1-pentene copolymer, propylene-1-butene copolymer, ethylene-1-hexene copolymer, ethylene-4-methyl-pentene copolymer, ethylene-1-butene copolymer, 1-butene-1-hexene copolymer, 1-butene-4-methyl-pentene, ethylene-methacrylic acid copolymer, ethylene-methyl methacrylate copolymer, ethylene-ethyl methacrylate copolymer, ethylene-butyl methacrylate copolymer, ethylene-methyl acrylate copolymer, ethylene-ethyl acrylate copolymer, ethylene-butyl acrylate copolymer, propylene-methacrylic acid copolymer, propylene-methyl methacrylate copolymer, propylene-ethyl methacrylate copolymer, propylene-butyl methacrylate copolymer, propylene-methyl acrylate copolymer, propylene-ethyl acrylate copolymer, propylene-butyl acrylate copolymer, ethylene-vinyl acetate copolymer (EVA), propylene-vinyl acetate copolymer, and the like.</p>
<p id="p-0065" num="0064">The polymer may be an amide-based polymer such as an amide-based elastomer and an amide-based resin. Examples of the amide-based polymer include polyamide 6, polyamide 11, polyamide 12, polyamide 66, polyamide 610, and the like.</p>
<p id="p-0066" num="0065">The polymer may be an ester-based polymer such as an ester-based elastomer and an ester-based resin. Examples of the ester-based polymer include polyethylene terephthalate and polybutylene terephthalate.</p>
<p id="p-0067" num="0066">The polymer may be a urethane-based polymer such as a urethane-based elastomer and a urethane-based resin. Examples of the urethane-based polymer include polyester-based polyurethane and polyether-based polyurethane.</p>
<p id="p-0068" num="0067">The polymer may be a styrene-based polymer such as a styrene-based elastomer and a styrene-based resin. Examples of the styrene-based elastomer include styrene-ethylene-butylene copolymer (SEB), styrene-butadiene-styrene copolymer (SBS), a hydrogenated product of SBS (styrene-ethylene-butylene-styrene copolymer (SEBS)), styrene-isoprene-styrene copolymer (SIS), a hydrogenated product of SIS (styrene-ethylene-propylene-styrene copolymer (SEPS)), styrene-isobutylene-styrene copolymer (SIBS), styrene-butadiene-styrene-butadiene (SBSB), styrene-butadiene-styrene-butadiene-styrene (SBSBS), and the like. Examples of the styrene-based resin include polystyrene, acrylonitrile styrene resin (AS), and acrylonitrile butadiene styrene resin (ABS).</p>
<p id="p-0069" num="0068">Examples of the polymer include acrylic polymers such as polymethylmethacrylate, urethane-based acrylic polymers, polyester-based acrylic polymers, polyether-based acrylic polymers, polycarbonate-based acrylic polymers, epoxy-based acrylic polymers, conjugated diene polymer-based acrylic polymers and hydrogenated products thereof, urethane-based methacrylic polymers, polyester-based methacrylic polymers, polyether-based methacrylic polymers, polycarbonate-based methacrylic polymers, epoxy-based methacrylic polymers, conjugated diene polymer-based methacrylic polymers and hydrogenated products thereof, polyvinyl chloride-based resins, silicone-based elastomers, butadiene rubber (BR), isoprene rubber (IR), chloroprene (CR), natural rubber (NR), styrene-butadiene rubber (SBR), acrylonitrile-butadiene rubber (NBR), butyl rubber (IIR), and the like.</p>
<p id="p-0070" num="0069">In this case, when the material of the resilient member <b>1</b>A is selected, it is preferable to pay attention to a loss tangent that is generally referred to as tan &#x3b4;, and it is preferable to select a material whose tan &#x3b1; at 25&#xb0; C. is smaller than 0.15, preferably smaller than 0.10, and more preferably smaller than 0.05.</p>
<p id="p-0071" num="0070">This tan &#x3b4; is used as an indicator of energy loss resulting from deformation of the material. Also, by using a base material whose tan &#x3b4; having a small value, energy loss occurring inside the base material during compressive deformation can be suppressed, so that higher resilience performance can be expected to be achieved. For measuring tan &#x3b4;, a dynamic viscoelasticity measuring method defined in Testing Standards such as JIS K7244-4 can be used.</p>
<p id="p-0072" num="0071"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>3</b>A and <b>3</b>B</figref> each schematically show buckling that may occur in the resilient member shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b>A</figref>. Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>3</b>A and <b>3</b>B</figref>, the following describes buckling that may occur in the resilient member <b>1</b>A. Note that the cross section of the resilient member <b>1</b>A shown in each of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>3</b>A and <b>3</b>B</figref> is taken along a line IIIA-IIIA shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b>A</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0073" num="0072">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b>A</figref>, for example, in the state in which the resilient member <b>1</b>A is sandwiched in the height direction (in the Z-axis direction shown in the figure) between a pair of highly-rigid and flat-plate-shaped upper member <b>21</b> and lower member <b>22</b>, the upper member <b>21</b> is gradually pressed toward the lower member <b>22</b> (i.e., in the direction indicated by arrows AR shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b>B</figref>). In this case, a load is gradually applied to the resilient member <b>1</b>A in the height direction, with the result that the resilient member <b>1</b>A undergoes compressive deformation as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b>B</figref> At this time, due to the structure of the resilient member <b>1</b>A, the upright wall portion <b>13</b> deforms, and then, a load above a certain level is applied to thereby cause buckling in the upright wall portion <b>13</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0074" num="0073">On the other hand, when this pressure application is stopped, the load applied to the resilient member <b>1</b>A in the height direction decreases and disappears. Thereby, the compressive deformation occurring in the resilient member <b>1</b>A is removed and the resilient member <b>1</b>A returns to its original shape. At this time, buckling occurring in the resilient member <b>1</b>A also disappears.</p>
<p id="p-0075" num="0074">When such compressive deformation is removed, the elastic restoring force of the resilient member <b>1</b>A applies resilient force to the upper member <b>21</b> and the lower member <b>22</b> in the direction in which the upper member <b>21</b> and the lower member <b>22</b> are moved away from each other. The resilient force applied to the upper member <b>21</b> and the lower member <b>22</b> determines the resilience performance of the resilient member <b>1</b>A.</p>
<p id="p-0076" num="0075"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b></figref> is a graph showing resilience performance of the resilient member shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b>A</figref>, and <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b></figref> is a graph showing resilience performance of a commonly-used shock absorber. The graphs shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>4</b> and <b>5</b></figref> each are what is called a stress-strain curve that represents the correlation between stress and strain assuming that the vertical axis represents the stress applied to a resilient member (a shock absorber) while the horizontal axis represents the strain of the resilient member (the shock absorber).</p>
<p id="p-0077" num="0076">As described above, buckling occurs in the resilient member <b>1</b>A due to its structure in a process in which a load is applied to the resilient member <b>1</b>A in a gradually increasing manner (hereinafter referred to as a &#x201c;loading process&#x201d;). On the other hand, as described above, buckling disappears in the resilient member <b>1</b>A due to its structure in a process in which the load applied to the resilient member <b>1</b>A gradually decreases (hereinafter referred to as an &#x201c;unloading process&#x201d;). The compressive deformation of the resilient member <b>1</b>A accompanied with buckling appears as a characteristic curve in the stress-strain curve as described below.</p>
<p id="p-0078" num="0077">Specifically, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b></figref>, in the initial stage of the loading process, a stress a increases as a strain c increases, and accordingly, the stress-strain curve rises in an upward right direction. On the other hand, in the middle stage of the loading process, the stress a hardly changes even when the strain a increases, and accordingly, the stress-strain curve extends in a rightward direction. Then, in the final stage of the loading process, the stress a also increases as the strain e increases, and accordingly, the stress-strain curve again rises in the upward right direction.</p>
<p id="p-0079" num="0078">On the other hand, in the initial stage of the unloading process, also the stress a decreases as the strain c decreases, and accordingly, the stress-strain curve falls in a downward left direction. In contrast, in the middle stage of the unloading process, the stress a hardly changes even when the strain a decreases, and accordingly, the stress-strain curve extends in a leftward direction. Then, in the final stage of the unloading process, the stress a also decreases as the strain a decreases, and accordingly, the stress-strain curve again falls in the downward left direction.</p>
<p id="p-0080" num="0079">On the other hand, buckling does not occur in a commonly-used shock absorber due to its structure in the loading process. Thus, the compressive deformation of the shock absorber appears as a characteristic curve in the stress-strain curve as described below.</p>
<p id="p-0081" num="0080">Specifically, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b></figref>, from the initial stage to the final stage in the loading process, the stress a continuously increases as the strain e increases, and accordingly, the stress-strain curve rises in an upward right direction.</p>
<p id="p-0082" num="0081">In contrast, from the initial stage to the final stage in the unloading process, the stress a continuously decreases as the strain s decreases, and accordingly, the stress-strain curve falls in a downward left direction.</p>
<p id="p-0083" num="0082">It is known that, regardless of whether or not buckling occurs, a certain level of relevance exists between the stress-strain curve in the loading process and the stress-strain curve in the unloading process. Specifically, the stress-strain curve in the unloading process approximately coincides with a stress-strain curve that is approximately 0.7 times to 0.9 times in the vertical axis direction as the stress-strain curve in the loading process.</p>
<p id="p-0084" num="0083">In this case, as an indicator indicating superiority or inferiority of the resilience performance, an indicator called a normalized AER (Absolute Energy Return) is applicable. This normalized AER is represented by the area surrounded between the stress-strain curve in the unloading process and the horizontal axis (the area of the diagonally shaded portion in each of the graphs shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>4</b> and <b>5</b></figref>), and is represented by the following equation (1) assuming that the normalized AER is defined as &#x201c;wre&#x201d;. Note that &#x3b5;max denotes a strain occurring when the stress &#x3c3; in the unloading process is at the maximum level (i.e., at the level of &#x3c3;max shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>4</b> and <b>5</b></figref>), and &#x3b5;min denotes a strain occurring when the stress &#x3c3; in the unloading process is at the minimum level (i.e., when &#x3c3;=0).</p>
<p id="p-0085" num="0000">

<?in-line-formulae description="In-line Formulae" end="lead"?><i>w</i><sub>re</sub>=&#x222b;<sub>e</sub><sub><sub2>min</sub2></sub><sup>e</sup><sup><sub2>max</sub2></sup><i>&#x3c3;d&#x3b5;</i>&#x2003;&#x2003;(1)<?in-line-formulae description="In-line Formulae" end="tail"?>
</p>
<p id="p-0086" num="0084">As the value of the normalized AER is larger, the resilient force to be achieved becomes larger. Therefore, if the resilient member can be configured to achieve higher normalized AER, it becomes possible to increase the propulsive force during running by applying this resilient member to the shoe sole.</p>
<p id="p-0087" num="0085">In this regard, in the case of the resilient member <b>1</b>A that buckles during compressive deformation, in the middle stage of the unloading process, the stress-strain curve has a region where the stress hardly changes even when the strain decreases. Thus, if the resilient member <b>1</b>A can be configured such that buckling starts at a prescribed level of stress and a prescribed level of strain, resilient force greater than that achieved by a commonly-used shock absorber can be achieved.</p>
<p id="p-0088" num="0086">While the normalized AER is calculated from the stress-strain curve in the unloading process, a certain level of relevance exists between the stress-strain curve in the loading process and the stress-strain curve in the unloading process as described above. Accordingly, if the stress and the strain at which buckling starts can be adjusted as described above, greater resilient force can be achieved.</p>
<p id="p-0089" num="0087">In this case, the maximum stress applied to the shoe sole during running, which varies depending on the body weight, the body shape, the running method or the like of the wearer, the road surface condition or the like, is about 0.05 MPa to 0.55 MPa (in particular, about 0.05 MPa to 0.25 MPa for marathon, and about 0.25 MPa to 0.55 MPa for short-distance running), more restrictively, about 0.15 MPa to 0.4 MPa (in particular, about 0.15 MPa to 0.25 MPa for marathon, and about 0.25 MPa to 0.4 MPa for short-distance running). Thus, the above-described resilient member <b>1</b>A needs to be configured such that buckling starts within the above-mentioned stress ranges. In the following description, the stress range of about 0.05 MPa to 0.55 MPa as mentioned above is referred to as a &#x201c;required stress range&#x201d; for the sake of convenience.</p>
<p id="p-0090" num="0088">In other words, in the case of the resilient member that starts buckling at a stress smaller than the required stress range, the above-mentioned normalized AER cannot be expected to be sufficiently increased. Also, in the case of the resilient member that starts buckling at a stress greater than the required stress range, buckling essentially does not occur during running, and thus, the above-mentioned normalized AER cannot be expected to be sufficiently increased.</p>
<p id="p-0091" num="0089">On the other hand, the strain occurring in the resilient member during running varies depending not only on the body weight, the body shape, the running method, or the like of the wearer, or the road surface condition but also on the shape, the material or the like of the resilient member. In this case, in consideration of the facts that the shock absorbing performance is hardly achieved when the strain is too small and that the shoe sole significantly sinks when the strain is too large, the strain is preferably about 10% to 60%, and more preferably about 10% to 40%.</p>
<p id="p-0092" num="0090">Therefore, the resilient member <b>1</b>A needs to be configured such that buckling starts within the above-mentioned strain range. In the following description, the strain range of about 10% to 60% as mentioned above is referred to as a &#x201c;required strain range&#x201d; for the sake of convenience.</p>
<p id="p-0093" num="0091">Based on the viewpoint as described above, the present inventor conducted the following Verification Tests 1 to 4 to verify whether it is possible or not to implement a resilient member capable of maximizing the resilience performance during running when the resilient member is provided in a shoe sole. These Verification Tests 1 to 4 will be hereinafter sequentially described. In the following description, a point at which buckling starts in the loading process will be referred to as a &#x201c;buckling start point&#x201d; for the sake of convenience.</p>
<p id="p-0094" num="0092">&#x3c;Verification Test 1&#x3e;</p>
<p id="p-0095" num="0093">In Verification Test 1, a plurality of shock absorbers used in commonly available shoe soles were prepared, and the resilience performance of each of these shock absorbers was actually measured. A total of four types of shock absorbers according to Comparative Examples 1 to 4 were prepared, and their stress-strain curves were obtained using Autograph AGX-50 kN manufactured by Shimadzu Corporation as a measuring device. As for the test conditions, the compression rate was set at 1%/s, and the maximum pressure was set at 0.25 MPa.</p>
<p id="p-0096" num="0094"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>6</b></figref> is a graph showing measurement results of the resilience performance of each of the shock absorbers according to Comparative Examples 1 to 4. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>7</b></figref> is a table showing the characteristics of the shock absorbers according to Comparative Examples 1 to 4.</p>

From the viewpoint of reducing errors, various filtering methods may be applied as required for calculating the buckling start point.

<p id="p-0126" num="0124">Based on the results of Verification Tests 1 to 4 as described above, it is understood that resilient force higher than that in the conventional art can be achieved by a resilient member: configured to have a three-dimensional shape formed by a wall having an outer shape defined by a pair of parallel flat surfaces such that the resilient member may buckle when it receives compression force; and also configured to start buckling within the required strain range and the required stress range when a load is applied to the resilient member in a gradually increasing manner.</p>
<p id="p-0127" num="0125">In order to facilitate understanding, in the graph shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>13</b></figref>, the required strain range and the required stress range mentioned above are shown in dark color. Thus, when the resilient member is designed to start buckling within these dark-colored ranges, high resilient force can be achieved. Accordingly, by applying this resilient member to a shoe sole, a shoe sole and a shoe capable of achieving high propulsive force during running can be obtained.</p>
<p id="p-0128" num="0126">In this case, the resilient member <b>1</b>A described above has the unit structure body U configured by adding a thickness to each of divided structure units obtained by dividing a structure unit having the Kelvin structure into two in the height direction. In place of the structure unit having the Kelvin structure, a structure unit having another surface structure may be used.</p>
<p id="p-0129" num="0127">For example, similarly to the resilient member <b>1</b>A described above, in the case of a resilient member having a three-dimensional shape formed by a wall having an outer shape defined by a pair of parallel flat surfaces, other structure units such as an octet structure, a cubic structure, and a cubic-octet structure can be used in addition to the Kelvin structure.</p>
<p id="p-0130" num="0128">Each of the structure units having the surface structures as described above is a structure unit formed of a plurality of flat surfaces disposed to intersect with each other so as to be hollow inside. This structure unit is divided into two in one of the orthogonal three-axis directions, and a thickness is added to each of the divided structure units to thereby form a resilient member. Consequently, the resilient member capable of achieving high resilient force can be obtained.</p>

The outsole <b>112</b> may be formed of a single member or may be divided into a plurality of members as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>18</b></figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0153" num="0151">The outsole <b>112</b> has a relatively thin sheet-like shape and has an upper surface and a lower surface.

<p id="p-0155" num="0153">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>16</b> to <b>18</b></figref>, the highly rigid plate <b>113</b> is formed of a single member and extends in the front-rear direction (i.e., the direction intersecting with the ground contact surface <b>112</b><i>a </i>that corresponds to the bottom surface <b>110</b><i>b </i>of the shoe sole <b>110</b>A) so as to extend from the forefoot portion R<b>1</b> through the midfoot portion R<b>2</b> to the rearfoot portion R<b>3</b>. More specifically, the highly rigid plate <b>113</b> is disposed in a portion of the forefoot portion R<b>1</b> excluding the front end portion and a portion of the rearfoot portion R<b>3</b> excluding the rear end portion in the front-rear direction of the shoe sole <b>110</b>A while extending between the medial foot-side portion (the portion on the S<b>1</b> side) and the lateral foot-side portion (the portion on the S<b>2</b> side) in the left-right direction of the shoe sole <b>111</b>A. In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>17</b></figref>, the region where the highly rigid plate <b>113</b> is disposed is shown in light color in order to facilitate understanding.</p>
<p id="p-0156" num="0154">The highly rigid plate <b>113</b> is entirely formed of a plate-like member, and embedded in the midsole <b>111</b> and thereby fixed to the midsole <b>111</b> as described above.

<p id="p-0157" num="0155">In this case, examples of the specific method of embedding the highly rigid plate <b>113</b> in the midsole <b>111</b> may include, for example, a method of inserting the highly rigid plate <b>113</b> during cast molding or injection molding of the midsole <b>111</b>, in addition to the above-described method of inserting the highly rigid plate <b>113</b> to be sandwiched between two divided upper and lower parts of the midsole <b>111</b> during bonding.</p>
<p id="p-0158" num="0156">The highly rigid plate <b>113</b> is made of a material higher in rigidity than the material of the midsole <b>111</b>. The material of the highly rigid plate <b>113</b> is not particularly limited, and examples suitably applicable as reinforcing fibers may include: fiber-reinforced resin formed using carbon fibers, glass fibers, aramid fibers, Dyneema&#xae; fibers, Zylon&#xae; fibers, boron fibers, or the like; and non-fiber-reinforced resin made of a polymer resin such as urethane-based thermoplastic elastomer (TPU) or amide-based thermoplastic elastomer (TPA).</p>
<p id="p-0159" num="0157">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>15</b> to <b>18</b></figref>, the resilient member <b>1</b> is similar in basic structure to the resilient member <b>1</b>A as described above, and more specifically, the unit structure body U is formed by adding a thickness to each of divided structure units obtained by dividing a structure unit having the Kelvin structure into two in the height direction.</p>
<p id="p-0160" num="0158">In this case, for providing the resilient member <b>1</b> in the shoe sole <b>110</b>A, the resilient member <b>1</b> is configured such that its shape (for example, the outer shape or the like of the unit structure body U in a plan view as shown particularly in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>18</b></figref>) is slightly deformed while maintaining the basic structure of the above-mentioned resilient member <b>1</b>A.

<p id="p-0161" num="0159">The resilient member <b>1</b> is accommodated in the cutout portion <b>110</b><i>d </i>provided in the lower midsole portion <b>111</b>B, and is disposed such that its height direction (the Z direction shown in the figure) corresponds to a normal direction to the ground contact surface <b>112</b><i>a </i>that is the bottom surface <b>110</b><i>b </i>of the shoe sole <b>110</b>A.</p>
<p id="p-0162" num="0160">As described above, since the opening <b>110</b><i>e </i>is provided above the cutout portion <b>110</b><i>d </i>of the lower midsole portion <b>111</b>B, the upper surface of the resilient member <b>1</b> accommodated in the cutout portion <b>110</b><i>d </i>faces the highly rigid plate <b>113</b> through the opening <b>110</b><i>e</i>. Thus, the upper wall portion <b>11</b> of the resilient member <b>1</b> is bonded to the lower surface of the highly rigid plate <b>113</b>, for example, with an adhesive or the like, so that the resilient member <b>1</b> is fixed to the highly rigid plate <b>113</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0163" num="0161">On the other hand, the lower surface of the resilient member <b>1</b> faces the outsole <b>112</b>, and the lower wall portion <b>12</b> of the resilient member <b>1</b> is bonded to the upper surface of the outsole <b>112</b>, for example, with an adhesive or the like, so that the resilient member <b>1</b> is fixed to the outsole <b>112</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0164" num="0162">In other words, the resilient member <b>1</b> is disposed such that its upper surface reaches the highly rigid plate <b>113</b> and its lower surface reaches the outsole <b>112</b>, and thereby, the resilient member <b>1</b> is sandwiched and held between the highly rigid plate <b>113</b> and the outsole <b>112</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0165" num="0163">As described above, the cutout portion <b>110</b><i>d </i>in which the resilient member <b>1</b> is accommodated reaches the side surfaces of the midsole <b>111</b> on both the medial foot side and the lateral foot side. Accordingly, the resilient member <b>1</b> is exposed to the outside, and due to the structure of the resilient member <b>1</b>, an opened portion <b>14</b> (see <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>16</b></figref>) to be provided on the side portion of the resilient member <b>1</b> is also located to be exposed to the outside.</p>
<p id="p-0166" num="0164">In this case, as shown particularly in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>17</b></figref>, the resilient member <b>1</b> is disposed in a portion of the forefoot portion R<b>1</b> located closer to the midfoot portion R<b>2</b> so as to be located in a portion that supports a toe of the wearer's foot. Thereby, the resilient member <b>1</b> is located to extend over a portion Q<b>1</b> that supports a ball of the wearer's foot and a portion Q<b>2</b> that supports a hypothenar of the wearer's foot. In the configuration as described above, the resilient member <b>1</b> is disposed in a portion of the forefoot portion R<b>1</b> located closer to the midfoot portion R<b>2</b> and receiving the largest load during running, so that high resilient force can be effectively achieved.</p>
<p id="p-0167" num="0165">In this case, due to the structure of the resilient member <b>1</b>, the outer shape of the resilient member <b>1</b> is basically the same even when the resilient member <b>1</b> is turned upside down. However, in the state in which the resilient member <b>1</b> is turned upside down, the protrusions and the recesses appearing in the surface of the resilient member <b>1</b> are displaced in position. This requires the top side and the bottom side of the resilient member <b>1</b> to be set in a manufacturing process.</p>
<p id="p-0168" num="0166">At this time, in order to achieve higher resilience performance, it is preferable that the upper wall portion <b>11</b> of the resilient member <b>1</b> is not located at positions corresponding to the portion Q<b>1</b> that supports a ball of the wearer's foot and the portion Q<b>2</b> that supports a hypothenar of the wearer's foot. However, high resilience performance still can be achieved even when the upper wall portion <b>11</b> of the resilient member <b>1</b> is located at positions corresponding to the portion Q<b>1</b> that supports a ball of the wearer's foot and the portion Q<b>2</b> that supports a hypothenar of the wearer's foot.</p>
<p id="p-0169" num="0167">According to the shoe sole <b>110</b>A of the present embodiment and the shoe <b>100</b> including the shoe sole <b>110</b>A as described above, based on the high resilience performance of the resilient member <b>1</b>, the resilient force of the resilient member <b>1</b> is applied to the wearer's foot when the wearer's foot pushes off from the ground, and accordingly, high propulsive force can be achieved. Therefore, according to the configuration as described above, the shoe sole <b>110</b>A excellent in running performance and the shoe <b>100</b> including the shoe sole <b>110</b>A can be obtained.</p>

Note that a minimal surface is defined as a curved surface that is minimal in area among the curved surfaces having a given closed curve as a boundary.</p>
<p id="p-0196" num="0194">In this case, in the unit structure body U shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>26</b>B</figref>, the above-described surface structure is a Schwartz P structure, and the unit structure body U is formed by adding a thickness to each of divided structure units obtained by dividing a structure unit having the Schwartz P structure into two in the height direction (the Z-axis direction shown in the figure) among the orthogonal three-axis directions.</p>
<p id="p-0197" num="0195">More specifically, the unit structure body U includes one upper wall portion <b>11</b>, four divided lower wall portions <b>12</b>&#x2032;, and one upright wall portion <b>13</b> connecting the upper wall portion <b>11</b> and the lower wall portions <b>12</b>&#x2032;. The upright wall portion <b>13</b> extends to intersect with the upper wall portion <b>11</b> and the lower wall portions <b>12</b>&#x2032;, and is entirely formed in a substantially annular shape. Note that each of the upper wall portion <b>11</b> and the lower wall portions <b>12</b>&#x2032; has a flat plate shape, and the upright wall portion <b>13</b> has a curved plate shape.</p>
<p id="p-0198" num="0196">Each of the four divided lower wall portions <b>12</b>&#x2032; included in one unit structure body U is arranged continuously to, and thereby integrated with, one of the lower wall portions <b>12</b>&#x2032; included in another unit structure body U adjacent to the one unit structure body U. Thus, in the three-dimensional structure S, each of the lower wall portions <b>12</b>&#x2032; included in each of four unit structure bodies U adjacent to each other is arranged continuously to an adjacent lower wall portion <b>12</b>&#x2032; included in a corresponding one of these four unit structure bodies U, to thereby form one lower wall portion <b>12</b> substantially similar in shape to the above-mentioned one upper wall portion <b>11</b> (see <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>26</b>A</figref> and the like).</p>
<p id="p-0199" num="0197">The resilient member <b>1</b>B according to the present embodiment is intended to exhibit a resilience function in the above-mentioned height direction. Thus, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>26</b>A and <b>27</b>A to <b>27</b>C</figref>, the plurality of unit structure bodies U are repeatedly arranged in a regular and continuous manner in each of a width direction (an X direction shown in the figure) and a depth direction (a Y direction shown in the figure) among the orthogonal three-axis directions. Thereby, the three-dimensional structure S has a structure in which upward protruding portions and downward protruding portions are alternately arranged in a plan view. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>26</b>A and <b>27</b>A to <b>27</b>C</figref> each show only three unit structure bodies U arranged adjacent to each other in the width direction and the depth direction.</p>
<p id="p-0200" num="0198">In this case, in the illustrative description of the present embodiment, the resilient member <b>1</b>B is formed of a large number of unit structure bodies U arranged in the width direction and the depth direction, but the number of unit structure bodies U repeatedly arranged in the width direction and the depth direction is not particularly limited. In other words, the resilient member may be formed by arranging two or more unit structure bodies U in only one of the width direction and the depth direction, or may be formed of only a single unit structure body U.</p>
<p id="p-0201" num="0199">The method of manufacturing the resilient member <b>1</b>A and the material of the resilient member <b>1</b>A as described above are applicable as the method of manufacturing the resilient member <b>1</b>B and the material of the resilient member <b>1</b>B.</p>
<p id="p-0202" num="0200">Similarly to the above-described resilient member <b>1</b>A, the resilient member <b>1</b>B configured in this way also undergoes compressive deformation when a load is gradually applied to the resilient member <b>1</b>B by pressurization in the height direction (the Z-axis direction shown in the figure). At this time, due to the structure of the resilient member <b>1</b>B, the upright wall portion <b>13</b> deforms, and then, a load above a certain level is applied to thereby cause buckling in the upright wall portion <b>13</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0203" num="0201">On the other hand, when the pressure application is stopped, the load applied to the resilient member <b>1</b>B in the height direction decreases and disappears. Thereby, the compressive deformation occurring in the resilient member <b>1</b>B is removed and the resilient member <b>1</b>B returns to its original shape. At this time, buckling occurring in the resilient member <b>1</b>B also disappears. When such compressive deformation is removed, the elastic restoring force of the resilient member <b>1</b>B causes resilient force that consequently determines the resilience performance of the resilient member <b>1</b>B.</p>
<p id="p-0204" num="0202">&#x3c;Verification Test 5&#x3e;</p>
<p id="p-0205" num="0203">In Verification Test 5, a simulation model corresponding to the resilient member <b>1</b>B described above was prepared as Verification Example 7 and subjected to a structural analysis using a finite element method (FEM), to thereby calculate a stress-strain curve of the resilient member according to Verification Example 7 formed of the simulation model.</p>
<p id="p-0206" num="0204"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>28</b></figref> is a graph showing simulation results of resilience performance of the resilient member according to Verification Example 7. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>29</b></figref> is a table showing characteristics of the resilient member according to Verification Example 7. In this case, for comparison, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>28</b> and <b>29</b></figref> each additionally show the results of Comparative Example 2 by which it was confirmed that the highest resilient force was achieved in the above-described Verification Test 1.</p>
<p id="p-0207" num="0205">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>28</b></figref>, the stress-strain curve of the resilient member according to Verification Example 7 conformed to the stress-strain curve of the resilient member <b>1</b>A (see <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b></figref>) described above. In other words, in the case of the resilient member according to Verification Example 7, the loading process included a region where the stress hardly changed even when the strain increased, like a region included in the stress-strain curve of the above-described resilient member <b>1</b>A. Accordingly, the unloading process also included a region where the stress hardly changed even when the strain decreased.</p>
<p id="p-0208" num="0206">In this case, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>29</b></figref>, the normalized AER of the resilient member according to Verification Example 7 was 0.047 J/cm<sup>3 </sup>when the energy return rate was assumed to be 80%. The normalized AER of the resilient member according to Verification Example 7 exceeded the normalized AER of the shock absorber according to Comparative Example 2, and it was confirmed that high resilience performance could be achieved by the resilient member <b>1</b>B configured as described above.</p>
<p id="p-0209" num="0207">Further, it was calculated that the buckling start point of the resilient member according to Verification Example 7 was located at a point at which the stress &#x3c3; was 0.123 MPa and the strain c was 18%. In other words, it was confirmed that the buckling start point of the resilient member according to Verification Example 7 was within both the required stress range and the required strain range.</p>
<p id="p-0210" num="0208">&#x3c;Summary of Verification Test 5&#x3e;</p>
<p id="p-0211" num="0209">Based on the result of Verification Test 5 as described above, it is understood that resilient force higher than that in the conventional art can be achieved by a resilient member: configured to have a three-dimensional shape formed by a wall having an outer shape defined by a pair of parallel curved surfaces such that the resilient member may buckle when it receives compression force; and also configured to start buckling within the required strain range and the required stress range when a load is applied to the resilient member in a gradually increasing manner.</p>
<p id="p-0212" num="0210">Therefore, when the resilient member is designed such that buckling is started within the required strain range and the required stress range described above, high resilient force is achieved By applying this resilient member to a shoe sole, a shoe sole and a shoe capable of achieving high propulsive force during running can be obtained. In other words, by applying the above-described resilient member <b>1</b>B as the resilient member <b>1</b> included in each of the shoe soles <b>110</b>A to <b>110</b>H according to the above-described embodiment and the modifications thereof, a shoe sole excellent in running performance and a shoe including the shoe sole can be obtained.</p>
<p id="p-0213" num="0211">In this case, while the resilient member <b>1</b>B described above has the unit structure body U formed by adding a thickness to each of divided structure units obtained by dividing a structure unit having the Schwartz P structure into two in the height direction, examples applicable as a structure unit of other triply periodic minimal surfaces may be a gyroid structure and a Schwartz D structure. By configuring a resilient member by adding a thickness to each of divided structure units obtained by dividing the above-mentioned structure unit into two in one of the orthogonal three-axis directions, a resilient member capable of achieving high resilient force can be obtained.</p>

In this case, the upper highly rigid plate may be disposed to cover the upper surface of the midsole so as to extend in a direction intersecting with the normal direction, and the lower highly rigid plate may be disposed to cover the lower surface of the midsole so as to extend in a direction intersecting with the normal direction. Also in this case, the resilient member may be embedded in the midsole such that an upper surface of the resilient member reaches the upper highly rigid plate and a lower surface of the resilient member reaches the lower highly rigid plate.</p>

In this case, the resilient member may be formed of at least a part of the outsole.</p>
<p id="p-0254" num="0252">The shoe sole according to an aspect of the present disclosure may include: a midsole formed of a material lower in rigidity than a material forming the resilient member; and a sockliner covering an upper surface of the midsole and defining the top surface.

<heading id="h-0008" level="1">OTHER EMBODIMENTS</heading>
<p id="p-0256" num="0254">The above embodiment and the modifications thereof have been described with reference to an example in which a resilient member is provided in a part of a shoe sole including a midsole and an outsole, but the shoe sole may be entirely formed of a resilient member or a resilient member may be provided in a shoe sole not including a midsole or an outsole.</p>
<p id="p-0257" num="0255">Further, the above embodiment and the modifications thereof have been described with reference to an example in which the resilient member is configured to have not only an upright wall portion but also an upper wall portion and a lower wall portion, but the resilient member may be configured not to have one of the upper wall portion and the lower wall portion or not to have both the upper wall portion and the lower wall portion. In other words, since buckling that improves the resilience performance occurs mainly in the upright wall portion, the upper wall portion and the lower wall portion are not essential components as long as the resilient member can be installed into a shoe sole in some way.</p>
<p id="p-0258" num="0256">Further, the above embodiment and the modifications thereof have been described with reference to a shoe sole configured to have only one resilient member, but a plurality of resilient members may be separately provided in a shoe sole.</p>
<p id="p-0259" num="0257">Further, the above embodiment and the modifications thereof have been described with reference to an example in which a resilient member is formed by adding a thickness to each of divided structure units obtained by dividing a structure unit having a geometrical surface structure into two in one of the orthogonal three-axis directions, but the resilient member does not necessarily have to be configured in this way. In other words, any resilient member may be applicable as long as the resilient member is configured to have a three-dimensional shape formed by a wall having an outer shape defined by a pair of parallel flat or curved surfaces, and the resilient member buckles within the required stress range and the required strain range as described above. Further, even when a resilient member is formed by adding a thickness to each of divided structure units obtained by dividing a structure unit having a geometrical surface structure into two in one of the orthogonal three-axis directions, modifications such as chamfering a corner portion, changing the thickness in each part, or slightly changing the shape of the unit structure body may be performed as appropriate.</p>
<p id="p-0260" num="0258">Further, the above embodiment and the modifications thereof have been described with reference to an example in which the present invention is applied to a shoe including a shoe tongue and a shoelace, but the present invention may also be applicable to a shoe not including a shoe tongue and a shoelace (for example, a shoe including a sock-shaped upper) and a shoe sole included in the shoe.</p>
<p id="p-0261" num="0259">Further, the characteristic configurations disclosed in the embodiment and the modifications thereof described above can be combined with each other without departing from the gist of the present invention.</p>
<p id="p-0262" num="0260">Although the present invention has been described and illustrated in detail, it is clearly understood that the same is by way of illustration and example only and is not to be taken by way of limitation, the scope of the present invention being interpreted by the terms of the appended claims.</p>
