<abstract id="abstract">
<p id="p-0001" num="0000">In one aspect, the disclosure relates to antimicrobial films for use on high-touch surfaces in medical, commercial, and residential settings and methods of making the same. The films and coatings are robust and retain activity over time and are optimized to minimize diffusion time of virus particles as well as bacterial and fungal pathogens to the inactivating layers and/or particles in the films and coatings. In another aspect, the films and coatings are capable of inactivating multiple virus, bacteria, and fungi types, can be applied as sprayable coatings or adhesive backed films, or can be incorporated into fabrics. In still another aspect, the films and coatings can be formulated as transparent or can be a neutral color such as gray or white.</p>

<heading id="h-0003" level="1">BACKGROUND</heading>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">First identified in Wuhan, China, in December 2019, severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) has been declared a pandemic by the World Health Organization, affecting nearly every country in the world and with infections numbering in the tens of millions and deaths surpassing one million.</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">COVID-19, the disease caused by SARS-CoV-2, affects multiple organ systems and, in severe cases, can lead to acute respiratory distress syndrome, abnormal blood clotting, organ failure, pneumonia, septic shock, pediatric multisystem inflammatory syndrome, and more. However, many symptoms are respiratory and include cough, shortness of breath, low blood oxygen saturation, loss of smell and taste, and ground glass opacities in the lungs appearing on chest X-ray or CT scan, among others. Severe cases require hospitalization with courses of treatment that can include supplemental oxygen and even mechanical ventilation.</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">A key factor leading to the emergence of SARS-CoV-2 as a pandemic is the ease of transmission among individuals through respiratory droplets. In some cases, however, a mechanism of transmission exists wherein droplets from an infected individual land on an object and another individual touches the object which is now coated with infective particles. Infection from contaminated surfaces is known for other viruses and may occur for SARS-CoV-2. The US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention has recommended frequent disinfection of communal surfaces to reduce transmission. Recent work has shown that SARS-CoV-2 remains viable on solids for extended periods; it is viable for up to one week on hard surfaces such as glass and stainless steel. This has led to widespread fear of touching communal objects that may have been touched by other individuals on a previous occasion, and widespread efforts to decontaminate surfaces during the COVID-19 pandemic.</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">The ongoing COVID-19 pandemic has created a need for coatings that reduce infection from SARS-CoV-2 via surfaces. Such a coating could be used on common touch surfaces (e.g. door handles and railings) to reduce both disease transmission and fear of touching objects.</p>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">Other viruses also pose significant risks to human health through surface contamination, including, but not limited to, influenza viruses, rhinoviruses, other coronaviruses, norovirus, respiratory syncytial virus, parainfluenza virus, hepatitis A, B, and/or C, rotavirus, enteric adenoviruses, Zika virus, coxsackievirus, cytomegalovirus, Epstein-Barr virus, varicella zoster virus, measles virus, mumps virus, Rubella virus, Ebola virus, and the like. In addition, as can be seen from epidemics of recent years (i.e., SARS in 2002-2004, MERS in 2012, and the like), new viruses occasionally enter the human population, a phenomenon that is only expected to increase with climate change and high levels of human migration. Similarly, bacterial and fungal infections can also be transmitted by contaminated surfaces in hospital, transportation, and community settings. These include, but are not limited to, <i>Staphylococcus aureus </i>(including methicillin-resistant strains), <i>Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Enterococcus faecalis, Escherichia coli, Acinetobacter baumannii, Stenotrophomonas maltophilia, Mycobacterium avium, Mycobacterium chimaera, Mycobacterium abscessus, Streptococcus pyogenes, Streptococcus pneumoniae, Haemophilus influenzae, Legionella species, Candida albicans, Candida auris</i>, and <i>Aspergillus niger</i>. It would thus be desirable if a surface treatment or coating could simultaneously inactivate multiple pathogen types.</p>
<p id="p-0009" num="0008">Furthermore, bacterial and fungal diseases can also be transmitted to healthy humans via contact with infected objects. Hospital-acquired microbial infections are estimated to cost over $120 billion annually; however, standard surface treatments involving sprays or mists of antimicrobial chemicals are not advisable and may not be permitted in patient rooms, food-preparation facilities, and the like.</p>
<p id="p-0010" num="0009">Some viral particles have been shown to be detectable on solids for up to a week, so it would be highly desirable if an antimicrobial coating or wrap could be designed to rapidly inactivate these particles so that active viruses, bacteria, and fungi are not transmitted to a second person. It would further be desirable if the coating or wrap was additionally active against bacterial and/or fungal pathogens. Ideally, the coating or wrap would be robust, lasting for up to several months and surviving exposure to high concentration ethanol as well as bleach solutions. The coating or wrap could be used on often-handled objects and surfaces including those with irregular shapes such as, for example, door handles, shopping cart handles, light switches, phones and tablets, credit card readers and ATM PIN pads, and the like, to inhibit disease transmission and other surfaces where antimicrobial treatment is desirable, including those that may not be often-handled but are required by government or facility regulations to be regularly cleaned. Such a coating or wrap could be used in commercial, residential, and even medical settings, could be removed from surfaces by cleaning or peeling, and could be transparent or neutral in color, depending on the application site. These needs and other needs are satisfied by the present disclosure.</p>

The virus was never in contact with the solid. Leachate from CuO did not significantly inactivate the virus, even over 24 h of exposure.</p>
<p id="p-0020" num="0019"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>7</b>A-<b>7</b>C</figref> shows a schematic of various modes of enabling contact between the virus and the active surface. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>7</b>A</figref>: microbial and viral particles in a static droplet may take several hours to contact a surface by diffusion. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>7</b>B</figref>: A drying droplet is superior to a static droplet because of advection and a smaller volume, although time to contact the surface may still be variable. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>7</b>C</figref>: Imbibition quickly (i.e., on the scale of minutes or less) brings the viral suspension into close contact with the active material.

<p id="p-0033" num="0032">Additional advantages of the invention will be set forth in part in the description which follows, and in part will be obvious from the description, or can be learned by practice of the invention. The advantages of the invention will be realized and attained by means of the elements and combinations particularly pointed out in the appended claims. It is to be understood that both the foregoing general description and the following detailed description are exemplary and explanatory only and are not restrictive of the invention, as claimed.</p>
<heading id="h-0006" level="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION</heading>
<p id="p-0034" num="0033">One way to reduce transmission of COVID-19 and other viruses, as well as diseases caused by microbial and fungal pathogens, via surfaces is to engineer coatings and films that inactivate viruses and other microbes and to use the coatings and films on communal objects such as door handles, elevator buttons, and gas pumps. Possible applications extend to hospitals, schools, public transportation, etc. In one aspect, the coatings and films can reduce the inactivation period from one week to minutes or hours or whatever the expected interval is between users of the coated object. In one aspect, described herein is a surface coating with cuprous oxide and cupric oxide as the active ingredients. Cu<sub>2</sub>O inactivates 99.9% of SARS-CoV-2 in one hour and CuO reduces the infectivity of the virus by 99.9% in one hour. In a further aspect, the dramatic reduction in longevity of the virus from one week to one hour on stainless steel or glass shows that coatings have the potential to effect disinfection between users of communal objects. Similarly, coatings formulated with ZnO, Ag<sub>2</sub>O, and other metal oxides disclosed herein can inactivate viral particles, fungi, and bacteria in a short time period; exemplary applications are provided in the Examples.</p>
<p id="p-0035" num="0034">Although cupric oxide (CuO) is not as common as cuprous oxide (Cu<sub>2</sub>O) for antimicrobial use, previously reported antimicrobial and antibacterial properties suggest potential against SARS-CoV-2. In one aspect, a significant advantage of CuO is that the fully oxidized state enables sintering of particles into a porous coating with a very large surface area. In a further aspect, without wishing to be bound by theory, the mechanism of the antimicrobial and antibacterial properties of solid-state cupric oxide is believed to stem from contact between the microbial species and the oxide; release of ions alone appears to be ineffective (see <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>6</b></figref>). The high area of a sintered, porous film enables good contact between the microbe and the CuO solid.</p>
<p id="p-0036" num="0035">In one aspect, a porous coating can be beneficial due to greater surface area, protection of active antimicrobial metal and/or metal oxide particles from abrasion, or due to the ability of the pores to imbibe viral and microbial particles, thereby facilitating direct contact of the viral and microbial particles with the metal and/or metal oxides.</p>
<p id="p-0037" num="0036">In another aspect, the practical use of a CuO coating may depend on its cytotoxicity to human cells. Semisch et al. investigated the cytotoxicity of CuO microparticles (&#x3c;5 &#x3bc;m) against A549 and HeLa S3 cells after 24 hours of incubation. Their results did not show any sign of cytotoxic effect on either cells. Additionally, the median lethal dose (LD<sub>50</sub>) of cupric oxide is 2500 mg/kg (oral) and 2000 mg/kg (dermal) for rat, and no skin irritation or sensitization has been reported.</p>
<p id="p-0038" num="0037">Herein disclosed is the effect of a cupric oxide coating on SARS-CoV-2 in droplets. In one aspect, viable SARS-CoV-2 is used rather than a proxy virus, which means that experiments must be done under BSL-3 conditions but restricts the range of possible experiments. In a further aspect, use of active SARS-CoV-2 enables demonstration of real application to the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic. The infectivity was tested on Vero E6 cells, which are kidney cells from the African green monkey.</p>
<p id="p-0039" num="0038">In one aspect, a key parameter is a short time period for inactivation in order to minimize the probability that deposited droplets can infect a future user of the contaminated object. Further in this aspect, the time taken includes the time for the virus to transport to the active ingredient in the film or for the active ingredient to diffuse to the microbe. When the droplet lands on an impermeable solid, in one aspect, the microbe must diffuse through the droplet to reach the solid. Further in this aspect, with time, the droplet evaporates, which lessens the required distance for transport and causes convection, which will also affect transport.</p>
<p id="p-0040" num="0039">In one aspect, to speed contact between the microbe and the solid surface, disclosed herein is a thin, porous, hydrophilic, CuO film that draws aqueous droplets into its interior. In a further aspect, within the interior of the film, the transport distances are much shorter (&#x3bc;m) than for a droplet sitting on the surface (mm). Still further in this aspect, drying times can also be shorter. In any of these aspects, these effects should speed the collision between the microbe and the active surface or active ingredient. In one aspect, the interior space of the film also has much greater contact area of active ingredient that a planar surface. These results show that one exemplary CuO film reduced infectivity by 99.8% in about 30 minutes. In some experiments, other metal oxides including, but not limited to, Cu<sub>2</sub>O, ZnO, MgO, TiO<sub>2</sub>, Ag<sub>2</sub>O, Fe<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub>, Sb<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub>, Al<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub>, and any combination thereof, or other metals including metallic copper, metallic zinc, and/or metallic silver, and combinations thereof, can be used, with or without a polymeric or fibrous component such as, for example, quaternary ammonium polymers, polyethylene, polystyrene, polyvinylchloride, polydimethylsiloxane, a polyester, an acrylic, a nylon, an epoxy, a polyurethane, polypropylene, polyethylene, nanocellulose, metal wire, cellulose or a derivative thereof, chitin or a derivative thereof, wool, silk, cotton, flax, hemp, or any combination thereof. In some aspects, fibers can be treated with the films prior to processing to form the fibers into cloth or mats, thereby rendering the cloth or mats antimicrobial.</p>

<p id="p-0048" num="0047">Prior to describing the various aspects of the present disclosure, the following definitions are provided and should be used unless otherwise indicated. Additional terms may be defined elsewhere in the present disclosure.</p>
<heading id="h-0007" level="1">Definitions</heading>
<p id="p-0049" num="0048">As used herein, &#x201c;comprising&#x201d; is to be interpreted as specifying the presence of the stated features, integers, steps, or components as referred to, but does not preclude the presence or addition of one or more features, integers, steps, or components, or groups thereof. Moreover, each of the terms &#x201c;by&#x201d;, &#x201c;comprising,&#x201d; &#x201c;comprises&#x201d;, &#x201c;comprised of,&#x201d; &#x201c;including,&#x201d; &#x201c;includes,&#x201d; &#x201c;included,&#x201d; &#x201c;involving,&#x201d; &#x201c;involves,&#x201d; &#x201c;involved,&#x201d; and &#x201c;such as&#x201d; are used in their open, non-limiting sense and may be used interchangeably. Further, the term &#x201c;comprising&#x201d; is intended to include examples and aspects encompassed by the terms &#x201c;consisting essentially of&#x201d; and &#x201c;consisting of.&#x201d; Similarly, the term &#x201c;consisting essentially of&#x201d; is intended to include examples encompassed by the term &#x201c;consisting of.</p>
<p id="p-0050" num="0049">As used in the specification and the appended claims, the singular forms &#x201c;a,&#x201d; &#x201c;an&#x201d; and &#x201c;the&#x201d; include plural referents unless the context clearly dictates otherwise. Thus, for example, reference to &#x201c;a virus,&#x201d; &#x201c;a film,&#x201d; or &#x201c;a solvent,&#x201d; includes, but is not limited to, combinations of two or more such viruses, films, or solvents, and the like.</p>
<p id="p-0051" num="0050">It should be noted that ratios, concentrations, amounts, and other numerical data can be expressed herein in a range format. It will be further understood that the endpoints of each of the ranges are significant both in relation to the other endpoint, and independently of the other endpoint. It is also understood that there are a number of values disclosed herein, and that each value is also herein disclosed as &#x201c;about&#x201d; that particular value in addition to the value itself. For example, if the value &#x201c;10&#x201d; is disclosed, then &#x201c;about 10&#x201d; is also disclosed. Ranges can be expressed herein as from &#x201c;about&#x201d; one particular value, and/or to &#x201c;about&#x201d; another particular value. Similarly, when values are expressed as approximations, by use of the antecedent &#x201c;about,&#x201d; it will be understood that the particular value forms a further aspect. For example, if the value &#x201c;about 10&#x201d; is disclosed, then &#x201c;10&#x201d; is also disclosed.</p>
<p id="p-0052" num="0051">When a range is expressed, a further aspect includes from the one particular value and/or to the other particular value. For example, where the stated range includes one or both of the limits, ranges excluding either or both of those included limits are also included in the disclosure, e.g. the phrase &#x201c;x to y&#x201d; includes the range from &#x2018;x&#x2019; to &#x2018;y&#x2019; as well as the range greater than &#x2018;x&#x2019; and less than &#x2018;y&#x2019;. The range can also be expressed as an upper limit, e.g. &#x2018;about x, y, z, or less' and should be interpreted to include the specific ranges of &#x2018;about x&#x2019;, &#x2018;about y&#x2019;, and &#x2018;about z&#x2019; as well as the ranges of &#x2018;less than x&#x2019;, less than y&#x2019;, and &#x2018;less than z&#x2019;. Likewise, the phrase &#x2018;about x, y, z, or greater&#x2019; should be interpreted to include the specific ranges of &#x2018;about x&#x2019;, &#x2018;about y&#x2019;, and &#x2018;about z&#x2019; as well as the ranges of &#x2018;greater than x&#x2019;, greater than y&#x2019;, and &#x2018;greater than z&#x2019;. In addition, the phrase &#x201c;about &#x2018;x&#x2019; to &#x2018;y&#x2019;&#x201d;, where &#x2018;x&#x2019; and &#x2018;y&#x2019; are numerical values, includes &#x201c;about &#x2018;x&#x2019; to about &#x2018;y&#x2019;&#x201d;.</p>
<p id="p-0053" num="0052">It is to be understood that such a range format is used for convenience and brevity, and thus, should be interpreted in a flexible manner to include not only the numerical values explicitly recited as the limits of the range, but also to include all the individual numerical values or sub-ranges encompassed within that range as if each numerical value and sub-range is explicitly recited. To illustrate, a numerical range of &#x201c;about 0.1% to 5%&#x201d; should be interpreted to include not only the explicitly recited values of about 0.1% to about 5%, but also include individual values (e.g., about 1%, about 2%, about 3%, and about 4%) and the sub-ranges (e.g., about 0.5% to about 1.1%; about 5% to about 2.4%; about 0.5% to about 3.2%, and about 0.5% to about 4.4%, and other possible sub-ranges) within the indicated range.</p>
<p id="p-0054" num="0053">As used herein, the terms &#x201c;about,&#x201d; &#x201c;approximate,&#x201d; &#x201c;at or about,&#x201d; and &#x201c;substantially&#x201d; mean that the amount or value in question can be the exact value or a value that provides equivalent results or effects as recited in the claims or taught herein. That is, it is understood that amounts, sizes, formulations, parameters, and other quantities and characteristics are not and need not be exact, but may be approximate and/or larger or smaller, as desired, reflecting tolerances, conversion factors, rounding off, measurement error and the like, and other factors known to those of skill in the art such that equivalent results or effects are obtained. In some circumstances, the value that provides equivalent results or effects cannot be reasonably determined. In such cases, it is generally understood, as used herein, that &#x201c;about&#x201d; and &#x201c;at or about&#x201d; mean the nominal value indicated &#xb1;10% variation unless otherwise indicated or inferred. In general, an amount, size, formulation, parameter or other quantity or characteristic is &#x201c;about,&#x201d; &#x201c;approximate,&#x201d; or &#x201c;at or about&#x201d; whether or not expressly stated to be such. It is understood that where &#x201c;about,&#x201d; &#x201c;approximate,&#x201d; or &#x201c;at or about&#x201d; is used before a quantitative value, the parameter also includes the specific quantitative value itself, unless specifically stated otherwise.</p>
<p id="p-0055" num="0054">As used herein, the term &#x201c;effective amount&#x201d; refers to an amount that is sufficient to achieve the desired modification of a physical property of the composition or material. For example, an &#x201c;effective amount&#x201d; of a polyurethane refers to an amount that is sufficient to achieve the desired improvement in the property modulated by the formulation component, e.g. achieving the desired level of binding together of metal oxide particles. The specific level in terms of wt % in a composition required as an effective amount will depend upon a variety of factors including the surface on which the films and coatings disclosed herein are to be deposited, expected level of use and/or handling of the treated surfaces, solvent used to deposit the metal oxide or other particles, and pore size and hydrophilicity of the coatings and films.</p>
<p id="p-0056" num="0055">As used herein, the terms &#x201c;optional&#x201d; or &#x201c;optionally&#x201d; means that the subsequently described event or circumstance can or cannot occur, and that the description includes instances where said event or circumstance occurs and instances where it does not.</p>
<p id="p-0057" num="0056">As used herein, &#x201c;respiratory droplet&#x201d; refers to a droplet having a size from slightly less than 5 &#x3bc;m to 1000 &#x3bc;m, or of from about 5 &#x3bc;m to about 100 &#x3bc;m, that contains saliva, mucus, and other mater derived from the respiratory tract of an individual through everyday acts such as breathing, singing, and talking, through actions of individuals suffering an illness including sneezing, coughing, or vomiting, or through a medical procedure that generates aerosols such as, for example, cardiopulmonary resuscitation or intubation. In one aspect, respiratory droplets can contain microbial particles.</p>
<p id="p-0058" num="0057">&#x201c;Virus particles&#x201d; or &#x201c;virions&#x201d; as used herein refer to independent particles of a viral infectious agent. Intact and infective virus particles typically contain viral DNA or RNA, depending on the virus type, a protein coat, and an outside lipid envelope, although not all viruses will have a lipid envelope. In one aspect, the films and coatings disclosed herein are useful for inactivating virus particles.</p>
<p id="p-0059" num="0058">To &#x201c;inactivate&#x201d; a virus or microorganism is to render it noninfective. Viruses can be inactivated in a number of ways including through disruption of the lipid envelope for enveloped viruses, denaturation of surface proteins or proteins in the envelope by altering the local environment of the proteins, chemical inactivation, denaturation using a solvent or detergent, acid treatment, pasteurization, binding to an inanimate object, or another method. Bacteria and fungi can be inactivated through disruption of cell walls or cell membranes, permeabilization of cell membranes, disruption of cellular machinery responsible for the production of DNA, RNA, or proteins, and/or disruption of other metabolic pathways. In one aspect, inactivation of a virus or microorganism can render 100% of the virus particles or microbial cells in a sample noninfective, or about 99%, 95%, 90%, 85%, 80%, 75%, or about 70% of the virus particles or microbial cells in a sample noninfective. In one aspect, it is not necessary to render 100% of the virus particles or microbial cells in a sample noninfective because simply significantly reducing the number of virus particles or microbial cells greatly reduces the risk of infection.</p>
<p id="p-0060" num="0059">If a substance, film, coating, or article is &#x201c;antimicrobial,&#x201d; then that substance, film, coating, article, or the like is capable of inactivating all or a significant portion of at least one species of virus particles, bacteria, fungi, and combinations thereof that come into contact therewith, or inactivating enough virus particles, or inactivating or killing enough bacteria, and/or fungi that a subject contacting the substance, film, coating, or article will not contract a viral, bacterial, and/or fungal disease caused by the at least one species by touching or contacting the substance, film, coating, or article.</p>
<p id="p-0061" num="0060">A &#x201c;film&#x201d; as used herein refers to a thin layer of material. The film can be formed in situ (as by spraying a polymer or monomer onto a surface) or can be formed externally and applied to a surface (as in an adhesive-backed, flexible film that can be applied to a door handle, elevator button, or other existing object). In some aspects, films may include articles such as, for example, screen protectors. In one aspect, a screen protector can also incorporate an antimicrobial film. In any of these aspects, the films can have thicknesses from a few nm up to 1 mm. In one aspect, the terms &#x201c;coating&#x201d; or &#x201c;wrap&#x201d; can be used to refer to the disclosed antimicrobial films.</p>
<p id="p-0062" num="0061">A &#x201c;matrix&#x201d; as used herein refers to any organic or inorganic component used in association with a metal or metal oxide to form an antimicrobial film. Exemplary matrices include, but are not limited to, polymers (e.g. polyurethane, polydopamine, polymethylmethyacrylate), silica and silicate as well as mixtures thereof, textiles, and combinations thereof.</p>
<p id="p-0063" num="0062">&#x201c;TCID<sub>50</sub>&#x201d; or &#x201c;fifty-percent tissue culture infective dose&#x201d; refers to the amount of infectious microbe that is required to kill at least 50% of infected host cells, for example, in tissue culture.</p>
<p id="p-0064" num="0063">A &#x201c;robust&#x201d; film or coating is one that persists on an object, article, or surface during normal usage. For example, a robust film or coating on a light switch, door handle, or faucet handle would be capable of repeated and/or sustained contact with hands or gloves without wearing off or disintegrating. In some aspects, a robust film or coating is resistant to scratching and abrasion, extremes of temperature and/or weather, spills of liquids, and the like. In any of these aspects, a robust film or coating remains active (i.e., retains antimicrobial activity at a high level in this instance) and does not lose a significant amount of mass over time. In one aspect, in instances when a small amount of mass is lost from, for example, scratching or abrasion, it is not enough to hamper performance of the films or coatings disclosed herein.</p>
<p id="p-0065" num="0064">&#x201c;Porosity&#x201d; is a measure of empty space in a material and can be expressed as a fraction of void volume over total volume. Having a high degree of porosity (i.e., a value close to 1 or a percentage close to 100%) indicates that a material has a high void volume. Porosity can increase based on number and density of pores as well as size of pores. In one aspect, a higher surface-area-to-volume ratio in a material can be achieved by having a large number of smaller pores. In some aspects, pores can be interconnected. In another aspect, the porosity of the disclosed films and coatings is optimized to allow passage of viral particles while minimizing diffusion time.</p>
<p id="p-0066" num="0065">&#x201c;Wettability&#x201d; refers to the ability of a liquid to spread on and adhere to a solid surface and relates to intermolecular interactions between the solid surface and the fluid, as well as interactions within the fluid itself. In one aspect, the films and coatings disclosed herein are hydrophilic and thus wettable with water. Further in this aspect, wettability of the films and coatings allows for microbial particles in respiratory droplets to enter the interiors of the films and coatings and become inactivated. In one aspect, wettability can be evaluated using measurements such as, for example, contact angle.</p>
<p id="p-0067" num="0066">As used herein, &#x201c;diffusion time&#x201d; refers to the amount of time it takes for a respiratory droplet and/or microbial particles contained therein to travel to the inactivation layers of the films and coatings disclosed herein. Diffusion time depends on surface geometry and void space geometry, but also depends on the distance traveled. In a further aspect, by optimizing pore size relative to virion size, diffusion time can be reduced from a period of hours or tens of hours to just a few minutes.</p>
<p id="p-0068" num="0067">As used herein, &#x201c;transparent&#x201d; refers to a property of a material to transmit light without appreciable scattering and/or absorption so that objects on the other side of the transparent object can be seen clearly. Transparency does not require that 100% of light is transmitted through an object; some scattering or absorption can occur, but is sufficiently low such that a user can see through the object.</p>
<p id="p-0069" num="0068">Unless otherwise specified, temperatures referred to herein are listed in &#xb0; C. and pressures are based on atmospheric pressure (i.e. one atmosphere).</p>
<p id="p-0070" num="0069">Now having described the aspects of the present disclosure, in general, the following Examples describe some additional aspects of the present disclosure. While aspects of the present disclosure are described in connection with the following examples and the corresponding text and figures, there is no intent to limit aspects of the present disclosure to this description. On the contrary, the intent is to cover all alternatives, modifications, and equivalents included within the spirit and scope of the present disclosure.</p>
<heading id="h-0008" level="2">Antimicrobial Films and Coatings</heading>
<p id="p-0071" num="0070">In one aspect, disclosed herein is an antimicrobial film including a metal or metal oxide and a matrix, wherein the metal or metal oxide contacts the matrix. In some aspects, the metal oxide is embedded in the matrix. In other aspects, the matrix has an outer surface and the metal or metal oxide contacts or protrudes from the exterior surface. In any of these aspects, the metal can be Ag, Cu, Zn, or any combination thereof, and the metal oxide can be CuO, Cu<sub>2</sub>O, ZnO, MgO, TiO<sub>2</sub>, Ag<sub>2</sub>O, Fe<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub>, Sb<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub>, Al<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub>, or any combination thereof. In some aspects, the metal or metal oxide can include particles. In one aspect, the particles can have an average diameter of about from about 0.5 &#x3bc;m to about 50 &#x3bc;m, or of about 0.5, 1, 5, 10, 15, 20, 25, 30, 35, 40, 45, or about 50 &#x3bc;m, or a combination of any of the foregoing values, or a range encompassing any of the foregoing values.</p>
<p id="p-0072" num="0071">In one aspect, disclosed herein are porous, high-surface-area films with a thin inactivation layer (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>). In one exemplary aspect, a droplet <b>100</b> containing pathogenic organisms or particles <b>102</b> comes into contact with surface <b>110</b>, wherein surface <b>110</b> has been treated with a virus- or microbe-inactivating coating or wrap consisting of particles <b>106</b> optionally coated with inactivation layer <b>104</b>. When droplet <b>100</b> enters the coating or wrap, it is drawn into pores <b>108</b> in the coating, along with any pathogens <b>102</b>, which are then inactivated. In some aspects, the inactivation layer can be hydrophobic. In other aspects, the inactivation layer is hydrophilic In a further aspect, when the inactivation layer is hydrophilic, the hydrophilic nature of the inactivation layer, as well as the high surface area to volume ratio, draws the microbe-containing liquid towards the porous interior of the film. In a further aspect, once inside the pores, the microbe has a much shorter distance to travel to the inactivating layer. Without wishing to be bound by theory, inactivating the inside of a coating with a high surface area:volume ratio decreases diffusion time and protects the microbe inactivation layer from abrasion. In a further aspect, the film can remain hydrophilic after at least four months of use. In some aspects, a droplet making contact with the antimicrobial film has a contact angle of less than about 10&#xb0;, or of less than about 9&#xb0;, or of less than about 8&#xb0;, or of less than about 7&#xb0;, or of less than about 6&#xb0;, or of less than about 5&#xb0;, or a combination of any of the foregoing values, or a range encompassing any of the foregoing values. In another aspect, at from about 0% to about 95% atmospheric humidity, a 5 &#x3bc;L droplet is completely imbibed into the film within about 80 seconds or less, optionally within about 60 seconds or less, within about 45 seconds or less, 30 seconds or less, about 15 seconds or less, or about 5 seconds or less. In another aspect, a thicker film results in faster imbibition of droplets as compared to a thinner film having the same composition and structure.</p>
<p id="p-0073" num="0072">In another aspect, the coatings disclosed herein have both interior and exterior surfaces that inactivate viruses, bacteria, and fungi. In some aspects, the coatings disclosed herein can be combined with existing microbe-inactivating surfaces incorporating amine and ammonium polymers including quaternary ammonium polymers, metals and metal ions (e.g., copper, zinc, silver), metal oxides (e.g., Cu<sub>2</sub>O, CuO, ZnO, Ag<sub>2</sub>O), and combinations thereof.</p>
<p id="p-0074" num="0073">In some aspects, porosity in the films can be generated with fibers, particles, by etching, or using another technique. In one aspect, the particles can be Cu<sub>2</sub>O or other antimicrobial particles. In one aspect, the particles or fibers are intrinsically microbe-inactivating. In an alternative aspect, the particles or fibers are useful structurally for creating pores that can inactivate viruses, bacteria, and fungi. In any of these aspects, the films can include an additional inactivating layer. In one aspect, the inactivating layer can be added to the films after the pores are formed, or can be added to fibers, metal oxides, silica particles, silicate, or combinations thereof, or glass particles, prior to creation of the pores (e.g., by functionalization of the metal oxides, silica, silicate, glass, or fibers with amines or ammonium groups), or some combination thereof.</p>
<p id="p-0075" num="0074">In one aspect, the coatings disclosed herein can inactivate viral particles in one hour or less. In one aspect, the antimicrobial film can inactivate at least 45% of viral particles that contact the film within about 1 minute, 80% of viral particles that contact the film within about 20 minutes, or can inactivate at least 99.8% of viral particles that contact the film within about 30 minutes, or can inactivate at least 99.9% of viral particles that contact the film within about 1 hour. In any of these aspects, the viral particles can be from a poxvirus, human papillomavirus, parvovirus, lassa virus, rotavirus, herpes simplex virus types 1 or 2, influenza virus, human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), human T cell leukemia virus (HTLV), Epstein-Barr virus (EBV), human cytomegalovirus (HCMV), Kaposi's sarcoma-associated herpesvirus (KSHV), varicella-zoster virus (VZV), hepatitis B virus, hepatitis C virus, Ebola virus, Marburg virus, parainfluenza virus, human respiratory syncitial virus, Hendra virus, Nipah virus, mumps virus, measles virus, hantavirus, bunyavirus, Rift Valley fever virus, sin nombre virus, rabies virus, an encephalitis virus, West Nile virus, yellow fever virus, Dengue virus, norovirus, rubella virus, Zika virus, severe acute respiratory syndrome virus (SARS-CoV), severe acute respiratory syndrome virus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS), another coronavirus, or any combination thereof.</p>

In any of these aspects, the pores are sufficiently wettable by the microbe-containing liquid that the liquid is able to infiltrate into the film. In one aspect, the film is hydrophobic. In another aspect, the film is hydrophilic. Without wishing to be bound by theory, polymers can contribute in various ways to the films disclosed herein such as, for example, by serving as binders for particles, as fibers useful for creating the porous structure of the films, or a combination thereof. In some exemplary aspects, polymers are not required for the construction of the films. Further in these aspects, metal oxide particles can be bound together by another means such as, for example, by sintering.</p>
<p id="p-0081" num="0080">In one aspect, the film includes silica particles, silicate, amine groups or polymers, ammonium groups or polymers, or any combination thereof.

<heading id="h-0009" level="2">Pore Size</heading>
<p id="p-0083" num="0082">In one aspect, in the films disclosed herein, pore size in the films must be larger than the viruses, bacteria, and/or fungi to be inactivated to enable movement of the microbes through the pores. In another aspect, diffusion into the pores takes time. In a further aspect, diffusion may be suppressed by liquids and droplets having a greater viscosity such as might be seen with sneezes, coughs, saliva, and the like. In one aspect, smaller pores slow viscous flow into pores. Further in this aspect, larger pore sizes may equate to faster diffusion rates, but in another aspect, this must be balanced against considerations including surface area of contact for microbial particles against the inactivating film and other factors.</p>
<p id="p-0084" num="0083">In a further aspect, SARS-CoV-2 is about 100 nm in diameter, so the pore diameter for inactivating this virus would need to be greater than 100 nm in size, with other sizes being possible for other viruses, bacteria, and/or fungi having different particle sizes. In another aspect, a larger pore size can lead to a longer diffusional time before the microbe strikes the inactivating surface, so the pores can be less than about 500 &#x3bc;m in diameter, or less than about 1000 &#x3bc;m in diameter. Thus, in one aspect, the pores are from about 100 nm to about 1000 &#x3bc;m in diameter, or about 2 to about 1000 &#x3bc;m in diameter, or are about 10 to about 50 &#x3bc;m in diameter, or are about 100, 200, 300, 400, 500, 600, 700, 800, or 900 nm, or about 1, 2, 5, 10, 15, 20, 25, 50, 100, 150, 200, 250, 300, 350, 400, 450, 500, 550, 600, 650, 700, 750, 800, 850, 900, 950, or about 1000 &#x3bc;m in diameter, or a combination of any of the foregoing values, or a range encompassing any of the foregoing values. In some aspects, the pore diameter for non-leaching films is at least 10 times the size of viral particles so that initial viral absorption does not block the pores. In one aspect, the inactivating layer has a finite width that should not clog the entire pore. In a further aspect, the pores are ideally as small as possible considering the above limitations. In any of these aspects, the pores in one film may be of different sizes.</p>
<p id="p-0085" num="0084">In another aspect, the pores have a high degree of connectedness such that the microbial particles can access a large fraction of the interior surface. In one aspect, this feature decreases the time period over which the microbe can be inactivated.</p>
<p id="p-0086" num="0085">In another aspect, the pore volume of the film is from about 50% to about 70% of total film volume, or from about 55% to about 65% of total film volume, or is about 50, 55, 60, 65, or about 70% of total film volume, or a combination of any of the foregoing values, or a range encompassing any of the foregoing values.</p>
<heading id="h-0010" level="2">Wettability</heading>
<p id="p-0087" num="0086">In another aspect, the microbe-inactivating films disclosed herein have suitable wettability such that liquids are drawn into the pores. Further in this aspect, good wettability allows for a higher contact area for the microbe to collide with surface walls. In some aspects, the films have hydrophilic surfaces such that water can be drawn into the pores. However, in other aspects, surface chemistry can be tuned for particular applications. In one aspect, the wettability of the films can be adjusted by any method known in the art including, but not limited to, treatment with plasma, ozone, light, oxidizing fluids, acids, or bases. In a further aspect, the wettability of the films can be adjusted by addition of wettability compounds in the microbe inactivation layer.

Further in this aspect, alternative films can be used that incorporate CuO. In one aspect, CuO films can be gray in color. In another aspect, gray films may be more suitable for high-touch surfaces such as, for example, door handles, railings, and the like.</p>
<p id="p-0096" num="0095">In one aspect, ingredients for inactivating microbes can be opaque in some circumstances, and may decrease the transparency of films and/or coatings. In one aspect, factors such as, for example, density of particles, size of particles, thickness of coating, and/or refractive index mismatch of matrix material relative to the particles can be modified to reduce loss of transparency. In one aspect, the active antimicrobial ingredients can be present at the surface of antimicrobial films and coatings, or can be provided on a porous matrix such that ions, molecules, microbes, and virus particles can penetrate the matrix.</p>
<p id="p-0097" num="0096">In some aspects, the films and coatings can be transparent.

In one aspect, the antimicrobial film can be removed from an existing article after a period of use. Further in this aspect, removal of the antimicrobial film restores the original surface of the article.</p>
<p id="p-0125" num="0124">In an alternative aspect, the substrate can be an article to be coated directly with the antimicrobial film, or to be synthesized such that the antimicrobial film is an integral part of the substrate (e.g., a screen protector for a touch screen device).</p>

In one aspect, the personal protective equipment can be a lab coat or a face mask. In another aspect, the filter can be an air purification filter such as an air purification filter useful in a heating and air-conditioning system in a building.</p>
<heading id="h-0018" level="2">Mechanism of Action of the Films</heading>
<p id="p-0127" num="0126">In one aspect, the films and coatings disclosed herein should have surface coatings that spontaneously draw microbe-containing fluid to interior surfaces, such that the microbe contacts the interior surface of the films and coatings. In another aspect, the inactivating coatings disclosed herein appears on the inside of the films, as well as on the outside. In another aspect, drawing the virus particles to the interior of the films accomplishes several goals.</p>
<p id="p-0128" num="0127">In one aspect, drawing the microbe to the interior reduces diffusion time. Without wishing to be bound by theory, inactivation relies on close contact between the inactivation layer and the microbe. Further in this aspect, in the absence of a driven flow, the microbe must either diffuse to the inactivation layer or, alternatively, the molecules from the inactivation layer need to diffuse to the microbe. In one aspect, by drawing the microbe into a porous structure, the distance between the microbe and inactivation layer is reduced.</p>
<p id="p-0129" num="0128">In one aspect, diffusion depends on geometry of the surfaces and particles involved, but in another aspect, diffusion time depends approximately on the square of the distance traveled. In one aspect, a typical sneeze droplet is about 20 &#x3bc;L and has dimensions on the order of about 1 mm for a spherical or hemispherical droplet. Thus, in this aspect, the diffusion distance is on the order of about 0.5 mm. If this droplet is drawn into a pore that is about 50 &#x3bc;m in size, in one aspect, the diffusion distance can be reduced to about 25 &#x3bc;m and the diffusion time is reduced by a factor of about 400. In another aspect, by comparison, for a 100 nm virus, diffusion time can be reduced from tens of hours to a few minutes, and in another aspect, smaller pores can make diffusion even faster.</p>
<p id="p-0130" num="0129">In another aspect, in the films and coatings disclosed herein, the surface area of the inactivation layer can be much larger in a porous film since all the inside area can also inactivate the microbe. In one aspect, the surface area of the inactivation layer scales with the square of the typical dimension. Thus, further in this aspect, by shrinking the dimension of the porosity, a greater surface area of inactivation layer is gained.</p>
<p id="p-0131" num="0130">In one aspect, without wishing to be bound by theory, SARS-CoV-2 spike proteins have a net charge of about +3.5 at pH 7.4, while CuO from some exemplary embodiments has a negative zeta potential, and viral inactivation may occur due to electrostatic interaction of the spike proteins and the antimicrobial films.</p>
<p id="p-0132" num="0131">In still another aspect, the films and coatings disclosed herein are robust. Without wishing to be bound by theory, if the inactivation layer was only on the outside of the coating, it would be subject to abrasion and might lose effectiveness overtime. In one aspect, if the inactivation layer is also on the interior of the coating, then abrasion of surface layers will not cause loss of the majority of the inactivation layer.</p>
<heading id="h-0019" level="2">Applications of the Films</heading>
<p id="p-0133" num="0132">The films disclosed herein are useful in a variety of settings. In one aspect, the films disclosed herein can be used in medical settings. In a further aspect, hospital bed rails, light switches, equipment switches, faucet handles, and other items could be coated with the inactivating films disclosed herein.</p>
<p id="p-0134" num="0133">In another aspect, the films disclosed herein can be used in commercial settings, including, but not limited to, surfaces on construction materials and construction equipment, vehicle surfaces, transportation surfaces including those in mass transit vehicles and aircraft, door handles, shopping carts and baskets, shelving in stores, restaurant tables and seating, commercial kitchen surfaces, surfaces in grooming and personal care businesses, credit card payment equipment, machinery control buttons and knobs and surfaces, and the like.</p>
<p id="p-0135" num="0134">In still another aspect, the films disclosed herein can be used in residential settings including, but not limited to, doorknobs, furniture, kitchen counters, faucets, toilet handles, showers and bathtubs, computers and electronic equipment, as well as military equipment and surfaces in cruise ships, sports stadiums, amusement parks, theaters, hotels, smartphones and tablets and their covers, and the like.</p>
<p id="p-0136" num="0135">In another aspect, if there is a concern that a liquid contains microbial particles, the liquid could be pumped through a porous plug that is coated with the films disclosed herein to inactivate microbial particles that are contained in the liquid.</p>
<p id="p-0137" num="0136">In one aspect, the antimicrobial films are resisting to debonding from substrates or surfaces to which they are applied. In a further aspect, resistance to debonding can be measured using a standard test method such as, for example, ASTM D3359 method B. In one aspect, the antimicrobial films are resistant to debonding even in the presence of a disinfecting agent such as, for example, ethanol (e.g., a roughly 70% ethanol solution) or bleach (e.g., a roughly 3% sodium hypochlorite solution).</p>

Efforts have been made to ensure accuracy with respect to numbers (e.g., amounts, temperature, etc.), but some errors and deviations should be accounted for. Unless indicated otherwise, parts are parts by weight, temperature is in &#xb0; C. or is at ambient temperature, and pressure is at or near atmospheric.</p>
<heading id="h-0022" level="1">Example 1: Cu<sub>2</sub>O Deposition on Glass</heading>
<p id="p-0281" num="0297">Cu<sub>2</sub>O loaded glass has previously been demonstrated to have antiviral and antibacterial activity. However, loosely-bound layers on glass surfaces can be immediately damaged by touching, scratching, or even placement of a water droplet onto the surfaces. Thus, simple Cu<sub>2</sub>O loading is not practical for daily use. Further, it is possible that some antimicrobial activity may result from particles having dislodged from the surface and maintaining activity in suspension, which may not be useful in coating applications because of cytotoxicity or the loss of antimicrobial activity of the film when the active particles are removed from the film.</p>
<heading id="h-0023" level="2">Construction of Robust Thin Coatings of Cu<sub>2</sub>O on Glass</heading>
<p id="p-0282" num="0298">A commercial polyurethane was applied to a glass slide using a sponge or paintbrush. Drying times from 2-8 minutes were evaluated; it was found that after about 6-8 minutes, the polyurethane was touch dry. Few to no visible blemishes were created when the dried polyurethane was touched with a gloved hand. In some aspects, the polyurethane was applied to the glass slide using a sponge; this enabled the creation of a thinner, uniform film.</p>
<p id="p-0283" num="0299">Approximately 6-10 minutes after polyurethane application, a Cu<sub>2</sub>O suspension was applied to the film. Various concentrations of Cu<sub>2</sub>O in solvent were investigated. A water suspension was intended to reduce the solubilization of polyurethane in the Cu<sub>2</sub>O delivery solvent; however, the water did not wet the polyurethane and spreading was difficult.</p>
<p id="p-0284" num="0300">Both 10% w/w Cu<sub>2</sub>O in ethanol and 25% w/w Cu<sub>2</sub>O provided good results, i.e., a continuous layer of particles, often many particles thick, with few holes in the films, and was used in further experiments. Prior to further testing, the ethanol was allowed to dry for 5-10 min. Following Cu<sub>2</sub>O application and drying, the coated slides were placed in a 120&#xb0; C. oven for about 2 hours. Variations in w/w Cu<sub>2</sub>O in the range 10-25% w/w Cu<sub>2</sub>O produced good films but in some cases, 25% w/w Cu<sub>2</sub>O was easier to spray coat.</p>
<heading id="h-0024" level="2">Film Properties</heading>
<p id="p-0285" num="0301">The films created by the above method were stable to light scratching with metallic tweezers as well as to water droplets.</p>
<p id="p-0286" num="0302">The films were next examined using stereoscopic light microscopy. Advancing water contact angle was high at much greater than 90&#xb0;, but the receding angle was low. The high advancing angle meant there was poor contact between the droplet and the solid, which in turn would lead to poor kinetics of antimicrobial activation. It is believed that the Cu<sub>2</sub>O particles had been coated by the polyurethane, since the original Cu<sub>2</sub>O suspension had been hydrophilic. Thus, it was decided to remove some polyurethane.</p>
<p id="p-0287" num="0303">X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) showed that the outer layer of the Cu<sub>2</sub>O+polyurethane film had only about 10% of the expected level of copper, again suggesting the Cu<sub>2</sub>O particles were coated in polyurethane. However, since the escape depth of the electrons is only about 1 nm, it was believed that the polyurethane coating was thin.</p>
<p id="p-0288" num="0304">No change was visible after exposing the Cu<sub>2</sub>O+polyurethane films to soap and water, 70% ethanol, or Lysol&#xae; disinfectant.</p>
<p id="p-0289" num="0305">Additionally, the Cu<sub>2</sub>O+polyurethane films were subjected to the ASTM D3359 adhesion test described herein. Three independent samples were tested using this method, with the average number of affected squares being 2.4&#xb1;0.8.</p>
<heading id="h-0025" level="1">Example 2: Argon Plasma Treatment</heading>
<p id="p-0290" num="0306">Argon plasma was selected to sputter the treated surfaces in order to remove a thin layer of polyurethane and render the surface hydrophilic. Cu<sub>2</sub>O+polyurethane films were prepared as described above and treated with argon plasma as follows:</p>
<p id="p-0291" num="0307">25&#xd7;75 mm coated slides were soaked in water for about 5 min to remove free Cu<sub>2</sub>O particles, if any, from the surfaces. Samples were subsequently cut into 12&#xd7;15 mm sizes and blown with nitrogen gas to remove glass particles. Samples were placed in a vacuum chamber (&#x3c;200 mTorr) and flushed with argon for 10 minutes under dynamic vacuum. Samples were then plasma treated for 3 min at 100 W.</p>
<p id="p-0292" num="0308">Following plasma treatment, the films were hydrophilic. Water entered the film and is believed to have made good contact with the film interior. It is believed the interior surface of the film consisted of exposed Cu<sub>2</sub>O with polyurethane forming menisci between the particles to hold the film together.</p>
<p id="p-0293" num="0309">After a period of more than one day, the film became hydrophobic, and water did not penetrate into the film. This film was tested for the ability to inactivate SARS-CoV-2 in millimeter-sized droplets. The results showed a 39&#xd7; reduction (1.6 log) of virus after 1 hour, a 230&#xd7; reduction (2.4 log) of virus after 3 h and no detectable virus after 1 day, where the detection limit was at TCID50/mL, which was a 6000&#xd7; reduction (3.8 log). These results showed the ability of the inactivation layer to inactivate the virus. By increasing the wettability of the pores, suspensions of virus will be able to infiltrate into the pore structure that also contains the inactivation layer. Once inside the pores, the virus needs to diffuse only over the approximate dimension of the pore to reach the inactivation layer. This contrasts with the need for diffusion of the dimension of the droplet to reach the inactivation layer. Diffusion time increases with distance, sometimes scaling with the square of distance. Diffusion to the inactivation layer takes substantially less time inside the pore structure, so creating wettability of the pores is expected to cause much faster inactivation of SARS-CoV-2 that shown in the results above.</p>
<heading id="h-0026" level="1">Example 3: Fabrication and Characterization of Cupric Oxide Films</heading>
<heading id="h-0027" level="2">Materials</heading>
<p id="p-0294" num="0310">Cuprous oxide micro particles type HP III Type UltraFine-5 (95.6% Cu<sub>2</sub>O, 3.2% CuO and 0.1% Cu with trace lead, cadmium and arsenic, mean particle size 5.1 &#x3bc;m and mode 5.5 &#x3bc;m) were purchased from American Chemet Corporation. 100% Ethanol (ACS grade), 70% ethanol (Reagent Grade) and glass slides (25&#xd7;75&#xd7;1 mm) were obtained from VWR. Stainless steel 302 shim Precision Brand (unpolished ASTM A666, thickness 0.3 mm) was purchased from Amazon. The steel was cleaned with acetone and ethanol, and subsequently washed with soap and water for one hour. Concentrated bleach (7.5% sodium hypochlorite) was purchased from Kroger and water was from a Milli-Q Reference water purification system.</p>
<heading id="h-0028" level="2">Fabrication of CuO Coating</heading>
<p id="p-0295" num="0311">CuO thin films were prepared by thermal oxidation of Cu<sub>2</sub>O followed by sintering. A 10% Cu<sub>2</sub>O in ethanol suspension was sonicated for 6 minutes to yield a uniform dispersion. Glass slides were cut into 11&#xd7;11 mm pieces, rinsed with 100% ethanol and then 0.1 mL of the Cu<sub>2</sub>O suspension was applied on the surface. At this point, samples were left to dry at room temperature for approximately 20 minutes and then heat treated in a furnace at 120&#xb0; C. for 10 minutes 350&#xb0; C. for 10 additional minutes and 700&#xb0; C. and for two hours to oxidize and undergo early-stage sintering to create necks between the particles. Successful experiments were also conducted with final temperatures below 700&#xb0; C. (e.g., in the range of 400&#xb0; C. to 700&#xb0; C.). The furnace thermostat was returned to room temperature and the coated samples were cooled slowly overnight. The conversion from cuprous to cupric oxide was obvious from the change in color of the coating from red-brown to graphite-colored.</p>
<heading id="h-0029" level="2">XRD, XPS, and SEM</heading>
<p id="p-0296" num="0312">The X-ray diffraction (XRD) pattern obtained from a Bruker D8 Advance diffractometer (monochromatic Cu K&#x3b1; x ray, wavelength=1.5418 &#x212b;) was used to identify structure of the oxidation product. X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS; PHI VersaProbe III with a monochromatic Al K&#x3b1; source of 1486.6 eV) and electron-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDX; BrukerQuantax) were used to study the chemical composition of the surface of the film. Scanning electron microscopy (SEM; FEI Quanta 600FE-ESEM) was utilized to examine the coating morphology and film thickness. SEM images of the films are shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>4</b>A-<b>4</b>C</figref>.</p>
<heading id="h-0030" level="2">Contact Angle</heading>
<p id="p-0297" num="0313">The coating was designed to be hydrophilic to enhance the contact area between the droplet and the surface of CuO. The contact angle of 5 &#x3bc;L of water was measured using a First Ten Angstroms FTA125 to evaluate the hydrophilicity of the film. The FTA instrument was also used to generate the images of imbibition.</p>
<heading id="h-0031" level="2">ASTM D3359 Adhesion Test</heading>
<p id="p-0298" num="0314">The Adhesion performance of coated CuO films on substrates was assessed according to section <b>13</b> of ASTM D3359 standard code using a cross-hatch grid. An 11&#xd7;11 grid of cuts spaced 1 mm apart was cut on samples. The surface was cleaned with an ultra-soft brush, and then a piece of tape was applied on the grid and rubbed with a rubber eraser to ensure a uniform contact. After 90 seconds of application, the tape was removed rapidly while bent through about 180 degrees. Subsequently, the area was inspected using an illuminated magnifier and rated on a scale of 0B to 5B, with 5B assigned for perfect adhesion, to evaluate the adhesion performance according to standard ASTM D3359 classification of adhesion chart.</p>
<heading id="h-0032" level="2">Disinfection/Adhesion Test</heading>
<p id="p-0299" num="0315">A variant of ASTM D3359 method B was used to evaluate the robustness performance of CuO coating against disinfection methods. After inscribing the cross-cut pattern, the coating was soaked in 70% ethanol or 3% bleach for 20 minutes, then dried before applying the tape.</p>
<heading id="h-0033" level="2">Drying Times</heading>
<p id="p-0300" num="0316">The test solid was placed on an A&#x26;D Company balance with 0.1 mg resolution.

A 5 &#x3bc;L droplet containing 6.2&#xd7;10<sup>7 </sup>(7.8 log unit) TCID<sub>50</sub>/mL of the virus was spotted on the test solid at 22-23&#xb0; C. and 60-70% humidity, and after a predefined time, the coating was immersed in 300 &#x3bc;L of viral transport medium to elute the virus. The active virus within the eluted droplet was assessed using a 50% tissue culture infective dose (TCID<sub>50</sub>) assay using Vero E6 cells. The TCID<sub>50 </sub>assay consists of making a series of 3.16&#xd7; (i.e. half log) dilutions of the eluted virus. Cells on 96-well plates were exposed to one of the dilutions, with quadruplicates of each dilution. The cells were then incubated at 37&#xb0; C. and 5% CO<sub>2</sub>. After five days, the cells were assessed for any cytopathic effect. The dilution at which 50% (2 of 4) of the Vero E6 cell cultures showed a cytopathic sign is called TCID<sub>50</sub>/mL. Three independent samples (i.e. a new solid sample and a new inoculation of virus) were tested for each time point and the virus inactivation at each time point was calculated based on the reduction of log(TCID<sub>50</sub>/mL) as follows:</p>

<heading id="h-0036" level="1">Example 5: Analysis of Film Composition</heading>
<p id="p-0306" num="0321">Cu<sub>2</sub>O has a red-brown color, whereas CuO had a graphite color, so the conversion was visually obvious. The chemical identity of the coating was confirmed by XRD of the oxidized sample (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref>), which was consistent with diffraction patterns of CuO in the literature, and demonstrated that the coating was composed of monoclinic CuO. The absence of peaks from the starting material (Cu<sub>2</sub>O) showed that oxidation was complete, and the absence of other peaks demonstrated a low proportion of impurities. The outer nanometer or so of the surface of the coating was examined by XPS. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b>A</figref> shows that Cu and O are the primary elements, with the elemental composition of the surface being: 47.5% O, 40% Cu, 9.2% C, 1.7% Cl, and 1.6% Na. Carbon is a common contaminant in XPS. The oxidation state of the Cu was identified from the Cu<sub>2</sub>p<sub>3/2 </sub>spectrum (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b>B</figref>), which contained a broad peak at 932-934 eV and a characteristic satellite feature of CuO at 940-945 eV. The O1s spectrum is presented in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b>C</figref>. The peak at 932-934 eV was deconvoluted into two peaks at 932.6 and 933.8 eV (E<sub>b</sub>). The peak at 933.8 eV was assigned to CuO and the peak at 932.6 eV could be either Cu metal or Cu<sub>2</sub>O. The Cu L<sub>3</sub>M<sub>45</sub>M<sub>45 </sub>Auger spectrum (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b>D</figref>) was used to distinguish between these two possibilities. The single peak with a kinetic energy of 917.9 eV (E<sub>k</sub>) gave a Modified Auger Parameter of 1851.7 eV (E<sub>b</sub>+E<sub>k</sub>) was in excellent agreement with the known value of CuO (1851.7 eV), showing that CuO was the main species on the surface and not Cu<sub>2</sub>O and therefore the 932.6 eV peak was elemental copper. The presence of elemental copper is consistent with prior work demonstrating reduction of CuO in XPS spectra. The calculation of the Cu:O elemental ratio on the surface was complicated by two factors: (1) adventitious oxygen on the surface, such that only 67% of the oxygen was in the form of copper oxides, and (2) elemental copper on the surface: only 65% of the copper was Cu<sup>2+</sup>. After correcting for these effects, the ratio of Cu as copper oxides to oxygen bonded to Cu was 0.99, consistent with CuO on the surface of the coating. The chemical composition of the coating was also measured by EDX from two different points on each of three independent samples. EDX samples a layer about 1 &#x3bc;m in thickness. The average Cu:O ratio was 1&#xb1;0.3, consistent with the XPS and XRD results.</p>

The cross-sectional image showed a uniform surface with average 32&#xb1;1 &#x3bc;m thickness (95% confidence interval from two measurements), and confirmed the porous nature of the coating. The pore volume was estimated by measuring the volume of water that could be imbibed into a measured total volume of film (measured thickness from SEM and macroscopic 1.21 cm<sup>2 </sup>area). The approximate pore volume was 59&#xb1;6% (95% confidence interval from 3 measurements).</p>
<heading id="h-0037" level="1">Example 6: CuO Films Rapidly Reduce SARS-CoV-2 Activity</heading>
<p id="p-0308" num="0323">The ability of SARS-CoV-2 to infect Vero E6 cells after being deposited on surfaces is shown in (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>5</b>A-<b>5</b>B</figref>). Whereas the ability to infect cells after deposition on glass was reduced by only 60% after one hour, the activity of the virus recovered from the CuO coating was reduced by more than 99.9% on average. When the activity of virus from the coating to the glass is compared at the same one-hour time period, the average log reduction (equation 1) was 3.11 and the % inactivation (equation 2) was 99.9%. The 95% confidence interval for the reduction is that the infectivity was reduced by more than 99.35% in one hour (one tailed, heteroscedastic, calculated using R software). This performance is similar to the results obtained for the disclosed Cu<sub>2</sub>O coating, and distinctly superior to the published results for inactivation on copper surfaces, which was &#x3c;90% reduction comparing the 0 h to the 1 h time point and 8 h to reach the detection limit, which was &#x3c;99% reduction compared to the 0 h time point. After only 30 minutes there is already a large viable virus reduction on the CuO coating compared to the uncoated glass: on average 99.8%. The 95% confidence interval for the reduction at 30 minutes was that more than 96% of the virus was inactivated (one tailed, heteroscedastic, interpolation of glass results at 0 h and 1 h assuming constant half-life, calculated using R software).</p>
<p id="p-0309" num="0324">The results demonstrate very rapid reduction of infection by SARS-CoV-2 from a coating that can be used on objects such as metal door handles that can be heat treated.

<heading id="h-0038" level="1">Example 7: Material Leaching from the Coating does not Inactivate SARS-CoV-2</heading>
<p id="p-0310" num="0325">Study of the mechanism of inactivating of SARS-CoV-2 by cupric oxide is beneficial for the design of future antiviral coatings and surfaces. A number of reviews have summarized how copper may attack pathogens, and the mechanisms include the release of cupric ions, production of reactive oxygen species (ROS), surface catalysis, or contact killing with the solid. Herein, a test is described to evaluate the antiviral property of species that are leached from the disclosed coating or created by this coating. The hypothesis was that the virus was inactivated by species that are dissolved or suspended in the liquid after contact with the solid, and was tested by exposing the virus to the leachate from the film, without exposing the virus to the coating itself. The CuO coating was initially soaked in 300 &#x3bc;L of viral culture medium (without any virus) for 24 hours at room temperature. Next, 135 &#x3bc;L of the medium was mixed with 15 &#x3bc;L of the virus and the mixture was incubated at room temp for one hour (the time period of more than 99.9% inactivation by the film) or 24 hours (an exaggerated time scale to allow for more subtle effects) before assessing the viability of SARS-CoV-2 to infect Vero E6 cells via the standard TCID<sub>50 </sub>measurement. Note that the virus was never in contact with the coating. This protocol was similar to that reported by Sunada et al.</p>
<p id="p-0311" num="0326">Results shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>6</b></figref> demonstrate that the infectivity of the virus when exposed to the CuO leachate compared was similar to when exposed to the culture medium (p=0.73, ANOVA with two factors&#x2014;time and solid). In contrast, when Cu<sub>2</sub>O coating was tested instead of a CuO coating, the TCID<sub>50</sub>/mL was reduced by over 10&#xd7;, indicating that this experiment had the capability to resolve a reduction (positive control, p=0.01). The hypothesis that dissolved material was the cause of inactivation was rejected, and it was concluded that contact killing is a mechanism of SARS-CoV-2 inactivation. These findings are consistent with the previously reported results for antibacterial properties of CuO.</p>
<p id="p-0312" num="0327">Contact inactivation of SARS-CoV-2 by CuO may be aided by an attractive charge-charge interaction. The culture medium has an ionic strength of about 0.15, which corresponds to a Debye-length of about 0.8 nm, which is still sufficiently long for electrostatic interactions to occur at short range. The spike proteins which protrude furthest from the envelope have 10 cationic amino acids, 7 anionic amino acids and one histidine, giving a net charge of about positive 3.5 at pH 7.4. The envelope (E) protein also has a net positive charge. Cupric oxide has a negative zeta potential (&#x2212;17 mV) in culture medium. SARS-CoV-2 should therefore be attracted to cupric oxide via an electrostatic interaction. It is also possible that this charge-charge interaction may be part of the mechanism of inactivation.</p>

<heading id="h-0040" level="2">Contact Angle</heading>
<p id="p-0313" num="0328">The CuO coating has been designed and engineered to be hydrophilic to rapidly draw in the infected droplet and inactivate the virus. Some cuprous oxide-based anti-SARS-CoV-2 coating that lose hydrophilicity over time because of the presence of polyurethane. It is expected that the cuprous oxide coating would have improved performance if it were to remain hydrophilic and therefore allow imbibition into the coating. Herein is disclosed a coating without polyurethane that will not age or have polyurethane covering on part of the active surface. The hydrophilic nature of the coating was maintained over an eight-week period. A water droplet rapidly wets and imbibes at any time during the 8 weeks test period, and advancing, sessile, and receding contact angles were &#x3c;10&#xb0;.</p>

<p id="p-0314" num="0329">Possible future applications where the CuO coating could be used on store door handles, public transportation railings and perhaps railings in medical environments that are sometimes made from steel are envisioned. Because such hand holds are commonly disinfected during the pandemic, it was tested whether the coating retained its physical integrity after exposure to common disinfectants using ASTM D3359 method B test where the adhesion was assessed in combination with disinfection by either 70% ethanol or 3% bleach in water. Approximately one-inch square pieces of stainless steel 302 were cross-hatched according to ASTM D3359-B, then exposed to the disinfectant, then the adhesion was tested. The test was conducted on three independent samples for each disinfection condition. The cross-hatching creates initiation sites for coating failure but damage at these sites was very low: the average number of affected cells was 0.67 (no disinfection), 1.3 (3% bleach) and 0.5 (70% ethanol). The coating was rated <b>4</b>B according to standard ASTM D3350 classification of adhesion.</p>
<heading id="h-0042" level="1">Example 9: Factors Affecting Inactivation Time</heading>
<p id="p-0315" num="0330">In principle, the time to inactivate the virus depends on two rates: the rate of transport to the active surface and the rate inactivation by the active ingredient. If transport is the rate-limiting step, then there is little point in accelerating the inactivation on contact. In general, the transport time is complex to calculate for a drying droplet on a surface. First, the transport depends on the mechanism. If the virus is inactivated by contact with a fixed solid, transport of the virus is the relevant quantity, whereas if inactivation is caused by dissolved ions, then the transport of the dissolved ions should be considered, as well as the time taken for dissolution to occur. Here, it is assumed that the Stokes-Einstein equation applies:</p>

<p id="p-0317" num="0331">Where k is the Boltzmann constant, T is the temperature, q is the viscosity, and r is the radius. The diffusion constant is inversely proportional to the radius of the species being transported. Therefore, the diffusion of virus will be much slower than of ions because the virus has a much greater radius (&#x2dc;50 nm, including spike proteins) than metal ions (&#x2dc;0.5 nm). Thus, transport of the virus is more likely important for contact killing. Since this data is consistent with a mechanism of contact inactivation, the effect of drying on the transport of the virus to the solid will be examined.</p>
<p id="p-0318" num="0332">The diffusion distance in a droplet depends on the droplet size and contact angle of the droplet on the solid (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>7</b>A-<b>7</b>C</figref>). Diffusion <b>200</b> of viral or microbial particles in a static droplet to a surface <b>208</b> can take up to several hours or more (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>7</b>A</figref>). In a drying droplet, evaporation <b>202</b> and advection <b>204</b> can decrease droplet size, speeding up contact of viral or microbial particles with the surface <b>208</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>7</b>B</figref>). When a porous coating or film <b>210</b> is present on surface <b>208</b>, imbibition <b>206</b> occurs. Imbibition draws the contaminated liquid into the pore space where diffusion distances are less than the pore size, which is controllable, and much less than the droplet size. Owing to smaller diffusion distances, the viral or microbial inactivation can occur in much less time on a porous film (minutes or less) (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>7</b>C</figref>) than on the non-porous film <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>7</b>A-<b>7</b>B</figref>). A large range of sizes is reported for respiratory droplets in air: &#x3c;1 &#x3bc;m to 100 &#x3bc;m, for talking, and coughing, and much larger for sneezing, 300-900 &#x3bc;m, or even mm in size, which means that if spherical, the typical dimension is about 1 mm. The smaller droplets are more likely to evaporate quickly before settling, so the larger droplets which are deposited (&#x3e;10 &#x3bc;m) are the most important here. So these 5 &#x3bc;L (r&#x2248;1 mm) test droplets are at the larger, but still relevant end of the spectrum. The initial contact angle on an impermeable surface also has an effect: the lower the angle, the smaller the average diffusion distance. Using a typical diffusion distance of 0.5 mm, the viscosity of saliva&#x2248;0.07 N s m<sup>&#x2212;2</sup>, and approximating to planar diffusion from the center of the droplet, the diffusion time will be on the order of many hours. For a non-evaporating sessile droplet on an impermeable solid diffusion alone cannot be relied upon to carry the virus to the surface of a film between two subsequent users of a communal object such as a door handle.</p>
<p id="p-0319" num="0333">Drying of the droplet will clearly be a major factor in bringing the virus into contact with the solid. Deposition of particles onto impermeable solids from an evaporating droplet has been studied extensively, especially the phenomenon known as the &#x201c;coffee ring effect.&#x201d; The deposition depends on the presence of surface active agents and other species in the droplet. For respiratory droplets there will be biological polymers, salts and other ingredients. In brief, evaporation of the liquid leads to a diminishing droplet volume, but also sets up flows within the droplet, which together with surface tension gradients affect deposition. Particularly the diminishing size of the droplet, but also the convection will speed transport to the surface. In the final stages of dying, the concentration of any leachate may climb dramatically, if dissolution is out of equilibrium. The overall drying will depend strongly on the temperature and the humidity.</p>
<p id="p-0320" num="0334">By creating a porous hydrophilic film that imbibes the droplet, as has been done here, the situation is changed considerably (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>7</b>A-<b>7</b>C</figref>). The most important point is that, instead of diffusion over the millimeter scale of the droplet, once imbibition occurs, diffusion of virus need only occur over the designed size of the pore, which here is on the order of micrometers. This thousand-fold reduction in scale should make diffusion tenable for driving contact of the virus with the active surface. In addition, imbibing into a porous film removes the vicissitudes of the local temperature and humidity that are critical if drying is used to draw the virus into contact with the active solid. Clearly for hot, low humidity conditions, droplets will dry very quickly and draw the virus into contact with the solid but at high humidity drying will be slow.</p>
<p id="p-0321" num="0335">Imbibition into the disclosed coating would not be as effective if the pore space were already filled with water that condenses from the air. The Kelvin equation suggests that capillary condensation will only occur for large pores as the humidity approaches 100%. Calculation would require detailed knowledge of the pore geometry, which is in this case inhomogeneous; here imbibition of water into the CuO coating has simply been measured as a function of humidity. These results show that, in the range 0-95% humidity, a 5 &#x3bc;L droplet is imbibed into the film within 80 s (see <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>8</b></figref>), which is a suitable transport time for viral inactivation and suggests that the coating will be deployable over most of the normal range of humidity conditions. In fact, imbibition is not much slower at 95% humidity than at 0% humidity.</p>
<p id="p-0322" num="0336">Although very small pores are advantageous for creating small diffusion distances, the viscous drag is important for imbibing the liquid into the solid. This should be considered for respiratory droplets. The Washburn equation approximates the distance travelled, L, into a pore of the coating for a given time:</p>

<p id="p-0326" num="0338">A porous film provides a much greater surface area than a smooth film. Whether the mechanism is contact inactivation or dissolution, the greater surface area is beneficial for inactivation via one of these surface process. In addition, the porous surface provides an opportunity for faster drying of a droplet. Faster drying reduces the time taken to pull the suspended virus into proximity with the active surface. In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>9</b></figref>, the drying times on the porous CuO coating to the uncoated (no-porous) solid for both water and droplets of human saliva are compared. For both saliva and water, the drying rate was about three times as fast on the CuO film. On the CuO film, the droplet is effectively dry after about 10 minutes. Drying aids the process of pulling the virus into contact with the solid, and drying readies the surface for subsequent respiratory droplets. Improved drying time is therefore a significant advantage of a porous film for reducing transmission to subsequent users of communal objects.</p>
<p id="p-0327" num="0339">An additional advantage of a porous film is that the active surface within the pore structure is provided with a degree of protection from abrasions and other insults that occur to the surface layers during normal usage. For comparison, molecular layers on an impermeable surface coating may be subject to rapid wear with associated loss of effectiveness.</p>

<heading id="h-0045" level="2">Fabrication</heading>
<p id="p-0328" num="0340">Glass slides were used as an example substrate since glass represents a primary surface where transparency is important. A 0.2% (w/w) suspension of Cu<sub>2</sub>O microparticles (average diameter 5 &#x3bc;m) in 10 mM Tris buffer in water was prepared and sonicated for 1 h to disperse the particles. Dopamine hydrochloride was added to the suspension to make a final concentration of 0.05 g dopamine/L. The resulting suspension was deposited on a substrate (in this case, glass) and the substrate was placed in an oven at 80&#xb0; C. for 30 min to dry. The deposition can be done by spray coating, dip casting or drop casting. Spraying is a very rapid method for applying the coating. The coating was blown with nitrogen gas before testing. In some biological testing experiments, the coating was also disinfected by immersion in 70% ethanol, but this step was not required for fabrication. In some examples, this procedure was repeated using Cu microparticles instead of Cu<sub>2</sub>O microparticles. An additional transparent antimicrobial coating was prepared consisting of Ag<sub>2</sub>O in a silica matrix.</p>

<heading id="h-0050" level="1">Example 13: Transparent Antimicrobial Coating Made by Incorporating Silver Oxide Particles into a Silica/Silicate Film Prepared by the Sol-Gel Process</heading>
<heading id="h-0051" level="2">Fabrication</heading>
<p id="p-0335" num="0347">Silver oxide particles were synthesized by taking 600 mL of 0.01 M AgNO<sub>3 </sub>in DI water and stirring while 1200 mL of 0.01 M NH<sub>3 </sub>in DI water was added dropwise, and then the mixture was stirred for 10 minutes. Subsequently, 60 mL of 2 M NaOH was added dropwise. The addition of NaOH caused the solution to darken, demonstrating the synthesis of small Ag<sub>2</sub>O particles. The suspension was left for 12 hours, during which time, the particles precipitated. After precipitation, the particles were washed three times with DI water and then three times with ethanol. Lastly, the supernatant liquid was decanted from the particles and particles were left to dry.</p>
<p id="p-0336" num="0348">We describe here how glass was coated but other objects can be coated in a similar fashion. Glass slides where cut into 12&#xd7;12 mm pieces and cleaned serially with DI water, 70% ethanol, 6M nitric acid and DI water respectively. Those glass pieces acted as the Ag<sub>2</sub>O-free, control samples. To prepare the transparent silver oxide-coated surfaces, glass pieces were 02 plasma treated at a pressure of less than 200 Torr and 100 W for 5 minutes. Immediately after the plasma treatment, 34 &#x3bc;L of a suspension of Ag<sub>2</sub>O in 2.8% (vol/vol) tetraethyl orthosilicate (TEOS) in ethanol solution was applied on the glass pieces. The volume of TEOS was a compromise between achieving good binding to the solid and not covering the Ag<sub>2</sub>O particles. Substrates were then placed in partially sealed leveled containers to limit evaporation and the self-assembly of the particles accordingly.</p>
<p id="p-0337" num="0349">Two different coatings that differed by the solids-loading of Ag<sub>2</sub>O particles were prepared. The Ag<sub>2</sub>O-coating had 5.0 mg/mL Ag<sub>2</sub>O powder in suspension (1.2 mg of Ag<sub>2</sub>O per mm2 of glass surface) whereas 2&#xd7;Ag<sub>2</sub>O-coating had 10 mg/mL Ag<sub>2</sub>O powder in suspension (2.4 mg of Ag<sub>2</sub>O per mm2). After two hours, the ethanol was evaporated and samples were transferred to a leveled sealed container in contact with vapors of 8 M DI water in ethanol and 7.62 M ammonia in DI Water for 20 hours. Next, the samples were heat-treated at 50&#xb0; C. for one hr. Lastly, samples were blown with high pressure nitrogen, rinsed upside down in DI water for 10 minutes and dried with a nitrogen gas. We used cleaned glass and TEOS samples as controls in antimicrobial experiments.</p>

<heading id="h-0053" level="2">Abrasion Resistance</heading>
<p id="p-0339" num="0351">The silver oxide coating (2&#xd7;Ag<sub>2</sub>O) was further tested for abrasion resistance using a modification of the United States Environmental Protection Agency Protocol &#x201c;Interim Method for Evaluating the Efficacy of Antimicrobial Surface Coatings&#x201d; published Oct. 2, 2020. The principal modification was to use 70% ethanol in water as the disinfectant because few individuals use bleach or hydrogen peroxide to disinfect phones or other electronic devices.</p>
<p id="p-0340" num="0352">The substrate used for the testing was cleaned, degreased, and disinfected with 70% ethanol in water. A Gardco Abrasion tester D10V was used and was also disinfected with 70% ethanol solution in water. A tray and sponge holder (boat) were likewise disinfected. All items were allowed to dry completely.</p>
<p id="p-0341" num="0353">The number of stroke cycles was set to 4 and the speed was set to 2.2 for the abrasion tester, where 1 stroke cycle is equal to 2 single passes. A sponge was autoclaved for 20 minutes and left in a laminar flow cabinet overnight to dry. 20 mL of 70% ethanol in water was poured into a small sterile container and the dried sponge was immersed in this for 10 minutes to wet. The wet sponge was used within 1 hour of application.</p>
<p id="p-0342" num="0354">The sponge was placed into the boat and the weight o the boat was adjusted to 1 lb. The sponge extended a minimum of 5 mm beyond the rim of the sponge boat and the boat was assembled such that the whole force of the weight of the boat was exerted on the surface through the sponge.</p>
<p id="p-0343" num="0355">Test samples were adhered side by side with double sided tape and face up. The abrasion tester was reset and one abrasion cycle (i.e. 8 single passes of the boat) on the test surfaces were conducted. Following one abrasion cycle, 70% ethanol in water was sprayed on the abrasion platform. The process was repeated until 10 abrasion cycles or 80 single passes were completed. The test samples were collected and blown with nitrogen to dry the samples. Test samples were stored in sterile petri dishes for antimicrobial efficacy testing.</p>
<p id="p-0344" num="0356">Abraded silver oxide coatings (2&#xd7;Ag<sub>2</sub>O) on glass were tested for antimicrobial activity with <i>Pseudomonas aeruginosa</i>. No colonies survived on the silver oxide coating after one hour, and the reduction of colonies was greater than 99.9% compared to the uncoated solid.</p>
<p id="p-0345" num="0357">The antimicrobial activity of the Ag<sub>2</sub>O film and the 2&#xd7;Ag<sub>2</sub>O film when coated on glass is shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>13</b></figref>. After one hour on the 2&#xd7;Ag<sub>2</sub>O film, the log reduction of <i>P. aeruginosa </i>is 3.44, the log reduction of <i>S. aureus </i>is 2.16, the log reduction of MRSA is 3.03 and the log reduction of SARS-CoV-2 is 2.15.</p>
