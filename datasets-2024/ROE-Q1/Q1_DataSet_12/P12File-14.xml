<abstract id="abstract">
<p id="p-0001" num="0000">A folding chair includes front and rear supports that fold and/or retract into central beams to reduce the space occupied by the chair in a folded configuration. A backrest is coupled to the central beams with a hub that allows an angle of the backrest relative to the central beams to be selected and for the backrest to be folded flat relative to the central beams. One or more actuators and pin actuators may control the relative movements of the backrest, front support, rear support, and central beams.</p>

<p id="p-0003" num="0002">Disclosed embodiments are related to foldable chairs and related methods of use.</p>
<heading id="h-0003" level="1">BACKGROUND</heading>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">Many conventional chairs include foldable elements that enable the size of the chair to be reduced for easy transportation and/or storage. Such chairs typically employ a metal frame and a fabric covering. When folded, conventional chairs may be placed in a bag for carrying or storage.</p>
<heading id="h-0004" level="1">SUMMARY</heading>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">In some embodiments, a chair includes a front support, a rear support, two central beams, a backrest and a hub, where the front support and rear support constitute the ground contacting elements. In one embodiment, the front support rotates relative to the central beams and the rear support translates relative to the central beams so that the chair may move between folded and unfolded configurations. In some embodiments, the backrest may rotate and telescope (e.g., translate) relative to the hub. In one embodiment, a backrest actuator (e.g., button) may be used to allow the backrest to telescope (e.g., translate). In one embodiment, when the backrest is in a folded position (e.g., substantially parallel with the central beams), the rear support may be allowed to translate relative to the central beams, whereas the rear support may be locked when the backrest is in other positions. In some embodiments, the hub may include a torsion spring that biases the backrest toward the folded position. In some embodiments, the two central beams may include one or more triggers which are actuable to allow the backrest to be reclined (e.g., rotated relative to the hub) in a direction opposite a biasing force from the torsion spring. In some embodiments, the hub and/or rear support may include a silicone wiper configured to brush off any sand, water, or other particles from the rear support as the rear support is translated. In some embodiments, at least one of the front support and rear support may be formed of an oval shaped tube. In some embodiments, the front support may provide a flat surface (e.g., a surface parallel relative to a horizontal plane) on which a user may place their feet for added comfort while seated. In one embodiment, a shroud may partially surround the front support and/or rear support to provide the flat surface. In some embodiments, at least one of the front support and central beams may include a rounded end at a hinged interface between the front support and the central beams that inhibits gap formation between the front support and central beams as the front support is rotated.</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">In some embodiments, a chair may include a fabric strap that may be used to carry the chair. In one embodiment, the fabric strap may be selectively attached to the chair at two attachment locations or at least three attachment locations to provide a single loop shoulder strap or a double loop backpack strap, respectively. In some embodiments, a chair may include flanged cylindrical buttons (e.g., mushroom shaped buttons) which may be used to attach one or more accessories to the chair. In some embodiments, a chair may include a releasably attached sun shade that clips to a frame of the chair. In one embodiment, the sun shade may be rotatable relative to the frame and may fold flat relative to a backrest of the chair. In some embodiments, a chair may include a fabric seating surface having a wire frame, where the wire frame may inhibit the seating surface fabric from bunching or otherwise forming an irregular surface. In some embodiments, a rear support of a chair may include a grip pad having a high friction material (e.g., silicone, rubber, etc.) which allows a user to securely place their foot on the rear support for folding or unfolding of the chair. In some embodiments, a chair may include a storage pouch or cup holder which may be releasably attached to the chair (e.g., on a front support or central beam of the chair). In some embodiments, a chair may include a foldable table that is releasably attachable to a single arm of a chair and may be suspended between two chairs side-by-side. In some embodiments, a chair may include a cargo net disposed on a backrest of a chair which may be used to secure larger items to the chair.</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">In some embodiments, a chair includes a frame, a seating surface coupled to the frame, and a backrest surface coupled to the frame. The frame may have a backrest frame including a first portion and a second portion, where the first and second portions are connected together in a telescoping manner whereby the backrest frame includes a retracted position and an extended position.</p>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">In some embodiments, a chair includes a frame having a backrest portion including a first portion and a second portion, where the first and second portions are connected together in a telescoping manner whereby the backrest portion includes a retracted position and an extended position. The chair may also include at least one blocking component coupled to at least one of the first and second portions, the at least one blocking component constructed and arranged to allow the backrest portion to move from the extended positon to the retracted position upon actuation of the blocking component.</p>
<p id="p-0009" num="0008">In some embodiments, a chair includes a frame having a backrest portion having a first portion and a second portion, where the first and second portions are connected together in a telescoping manner whereby the backrest portion includes a retracted position and an extended position.</p>
<p id="p-0010" num="0009">In some embodiments, a foldable chair includes a backrest frame having a first stile and a second stile disposed at least partially inside the first stile and configured to slide in the first stile between an extended and a retracted position, a blocking pin movable between a blocking position and an unblocking position, where in the blocking position, the blocking pin cooperates with the first and second stiles to inhibit sliding motion of the second stile relative to the first stile, and in the unblocking position the second stile is free to slide relative to the first stile. The foldable chair also includes a cable operatively coupled to the blocking pin at a first end, and an actuator operatively coupled to a second end of the cable, where the actuator is operable by a user to move the blocking pin between the blocking position and unblocking position.</p>
<p id="p-0011" num="0010">In one embodiment, an adjustable sun shade for a chair is provided. The sun shade includes a bracket, a first portion rotatably mounted to the bracket by at least one first coupling, and a second portion rotatably mounted to the first portion by at least one second coupling. The at least one first coupling is configured to releasably maintain the position of the first portion relative to the bracket and the at least one second coupling is configured to releasably maintain the position of the second portion relative to the first portion.</p>
<p id="p-0012" num="0011">It should be appreciated that the foregoing concepts, and additional concepts discussed below, may be arranged in any suitable combination, as the present disclosure is not limited in this respect. Further, other advantages and novel features of the present disclosure will become apparent from the following detailed description of various non-limiting embodiments when considered in conjunction with the accompanying figures.</p>

<heading id="h-0006" level="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION</heading>
<p id="p-0088" num="0087">Many conventional foldable chairs are heavy, cumbersome, and difficult to operate. These conventional chairs typically include multiple moving parts but do not collapse to dimensions which are ergonomic or well suited for ease of carrying (e.g., across uneven terrain such as on a beach or playing field). Moreover, these conventional chairs do not change from an unfolded to a folded state easily or reliably. Additionally, conventional foldable chairs do not include oftentimes desirable features found in non-foldable chairs due to weight, foldability, and other factors. For example, conventional foldable chairs do not include sun shades, arm rests, storage volumes, etc. which stow easily when the chair is retracted. Furthermore, conventional folding chairs do not include recline features which are easy to operate and do not interfere with the movement of the chair between unfolded and folded states.</p>
<p id="p-0089" num="0088">In view of the above, the inventors have recognized the benefits of a foldable chair that includes some or all of the features disclosed below with respect to the various embodiment described. It should be appreciated that although certain embodiments include various described features, not all embodiments need to include the features in exactly the disclosed combination, as other combinations of features are within the scope of this disclosure.</p>
<p id="p-0090" num="0089">In some embodiments, a chair includes a front support, a rear support, two central beams, a backrest and a hub. The front support and rear support constitute the ground contacting elements. The central beams span the distance between the front and rear supports and suspend a seating surface. In one embodiment, the central beams also slidably receive the rear support so the overall length between the front and rear supports may be reduced. In one embodiment, the front support is rotatably coupled to the central beams so that the front support may be moved into parallel with the central beams to occupy less space. The hub rotatably couples the backrest to the central beams, and, in one embodiment, allows the backrest to be moved between a seating position where the backrest is inclined relative to the central beams and a storage position where the backrest is parallel to the central beams. In one embodiment, the hub also enables the backrest to be reclined to different angles for user comfort. Thus, the chair may be moved between a seating position (e.g., an unfolded configuration), where a user may be comfortably seated, and a storage position (e.g., a folded configuration), where each of the front support, rear support, central beams, and backrest are substantially parallel to one another so little space is occupied in the storage position.</p>
<p id="p-0091" num="0090">In some embodiments, a front support for a chair may include a first front leg, a second front leg, and a base connecting the first front leg and second front leg. The base, first front leg, and second front leg may be arranged in a U-shape, where the first front leg and the second front leg extend generally perpendicularly from the base. In some embodiments, the front support may be formed of a continuous piece of material. The front support may also have a constant transverse cross sectional area throughout at least a majority of the length of the front support. Such an arrangement may allow the front support to sufficiently support a weight of a user while remaining lightweight and occupying little area. In some embodiments, the rear support and backrest may have a similar structural arrangement to that of the front support. That is, in some embodiments, the rear support may include a base from which two rear legs extend generally perpendicularly so that the rear support is arranged in a U-shape. Likewise, in some embodiments, the backrest may include a rail from which two stiles extend perpendicular so that the backrest is arranged in a U-shape. As noted above, such an arrangement may allow a chair to fold (e.g., into a substantially flat configuration) and remain lightweight while retaining structural rigidity suitable for supporting a user when unfolded.</p>
<p id="p-0092" num="0091">In some embodiments, a hub which connects a backrest of a chair to a central beam or one or more legs may allow a user to easily fold a backrest for storage, secure the backrest for use when the chair is unfolded, and/or adjust a recline angle of the backrest for comfort. The hub may include a housing and a rotational coupler disposed inside the housing. The rotational coupler may be rotatably coupled to the hub and may also be connected to the backrest such that the backrest is rotatable relative to the housing. The hub may also include a rotation lock, which is configured to selectively engage one or more locking regions of the rotational coupler. The rotation lock may be arranged so that rotation of the backrest relative to the housing is selectively inhibited depending on the position of the backrest and the direction of rotation of the backrest. For example, when the backrest is in a folded configuration, the rotation lock may not interfere with the rotation of the backrest to an unfolded configuration until the backrest reaches the unfolded configuration, which may correspond to the rotation lock engaging a first of the locking regions. When the backrest is in the unfolded configuration, the rotation lock may inhibit further rotation of the backrest in a recline direction (i.e., the same direction as moving the backrest from the folded configuration to the unfolded configuration). The backrest may also be inhibited from rotating toward the folded configuration. In some embodiments, the rotation lock may have a threshold force (e.g., from a biasing member such as a torsion spring) which can be overcome to rotate the backrest toward the folded configuration. The hub may also include a trigger that is operable to move the rotation lock out of engagement with the rotational coupler. The trigger may be operated so that the backrest may be reclined and/or to allow the backrest to be folded. Thus, the hub allows the backrest to be easily positioned for use in a comfortable position and allows the backrest to be easily folded for storage. In some embodiments, the trigger may be remote from the hub of the chair and linked to the chair via a trigger pin or another linkage. In other embodiments, the trigger may be disposed on the hub.</p>
<p id="p-0093" num="0092">In some embodiments, a chair may include a seating surface that is suspended from at least two central beams. The seating surface may be formed of a fabric material or other flexible material suitable to support the weight of a user while having a low weight. The seating surface may include a wire frame which is coupled to a hub and/or the at least two central beams. The wire frame may define and support a perimeter of the seating surface and may inhibit fabric from bunching or otherwise forming an irregular seating surface. The wire frame may be rotatable relative to the hub and/or central beams so that the wire frame may be folded up toward the central beams for storage. Of course, any suitable seating surface may be employed, as the present disclosure is not so limited.</p>
<p id="p-0094" num="0093">In some embodiments, a foldable chair may include a strap, which allows the chair to be easily carried while walking, or otherwise transporting the chair when the chair is in a folded state. The strap may be coupled at a first end to a first side of the chair and on a second end to a second side of the chair. Accordingly, the strap may be used as a single shoulder strap for carrying the chair on one side of the body. The chair may also include one or more clips which receive a central portion of the strap and retain the central portion against the chair. When the central portion of the strap is retained against the chair, the strap is configured to form two shoulder strap regions so that the chair may be worn as a backpack.</p>
<p id="p-0095" num="0094">According to exemplary embodiments described herein, a foldable chair may include one or more features that improve user comfort when sitting in the chair. These additional features may also fold flat or otherwise collapse with the chair to not occupy significant additional space when the chair is in a folded state relative to a chair without the additional features. For example, a chair may include a sun shade which folds flat against a backrest of the chair for storage. Put another way, the sun shade may be moved into substantially relative parallel alignment with the back rest so as to reduce the thickness of the backrest and sun shade combination in at least one direction. As another example, the chair may include armrests that fold flat against central beams of the chair for storage. As yet another example, the chair may include pockets integrated into existing seating or backrest surfaces, so that no additional space is occupied by the pockets. Of course, any suitable features may be included or omitted from foldable chairs of exemplary embodiments described herein, as the present disclosure is not so limited.</p>
<p id="p-0096" num="0095">Turning to the figures, specific non-limiting embodiments are described in further detail. It should be understood that the various systems, components, features, and methods described relative to these embodiments may be used either individually and/or in any desired combination as the disclosure is not limited to only the specific embodiments described herein.</p>
<p id="p-0097" num="0096"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref> is a perspective view of one embodiment of a chair <b>100</b> configured to move between folded and unfolded configurations. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>, the chair includes a front support formed of a first front leg <b>102</b>A, a second front leg <b>102</b>B, and a front base <b>103</b> and a rear support formed by a first rear leg <b>104</b>A, a second rear leg <b>104</b>B, and a rear base <b>105</b>. Together the front support and rear support constitute the ground contacting elements of the chair. The front support and rear support are connected together through central beams <b>108</b>, which in cooperation with the front support and rear support form a weight-bearing frame. The chair also includes a backrest frame having backrest stiles <b>106</b> that are coupled to the central beams via hubs <b>110</b> on each side of the chair. As will be discussed further herein, the hub allows the angle of the backrest relative to the central beams to be adjusted, whether that is to fold the backrest down for storage, unfold the backrest for use of the chair, or adjust an angle of recline of the backrest.</p>
<p id="p-0098" num="0097">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>, the chair <b>100</b> includes a seating surface <b>120</b> that is suspended from the central beams <b>108</b>. According to the embodiment shown, the seating surface may be formed of a fabric material, synthetic material, or other suitable flexible material appropriate for supporting the weight of a user. In some embodiments, the seating surface may include a plurality of fabric layers (e.g., two fabric layers, three fabric layers, etc.). Of course, the present disclosure is not limited in this respect, as a more rigid seating surface may be employed. The seating surface <b>120</b> also includes a wire frame <b>122</b> that preserves the outer circumferential shape (i.e., a perimeter) of the seating surface and inhibits bunching of the flexible seating surface material. In one embodiment as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>, the seat surface curves downward toward the ground near a front-most portion of the seating surface. Accordingly, the seating surface is formed in an arc from a rear of the chair toward to front of the chair.</p>
<p id="p-0099" num="0098">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>, the chair also includes a backrest surface material <b>124</b>, which is held in tension over the backrest <b>106</b>. The backrest surface material may be the same as the seating surface, and, in some embodiments, may be formed continuously with the seating surface. According to one embodiment as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>, the backrest stiles may curve rearward as the stiles approach the top of the chair. In this embodiment, the backrest surface <b>124</b> corresponding curves rearward near the top of the chair to provide additional space for a user's head or, in some embodiments, a pillow. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>46</b></figref>, however, the backrest may be generally straight near the top of the chair. According to the embodiment of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>, the seating surface includes a pocket <b>130</b> integrated into the seating surface of the material. The pocket <b>130</b> includes a waterproof zipper and may be low profile so as to not significantly increase the thickness of the seating surface when the pocket is empty.</p>
<p id="p-0100" num="0099">According to one embodiment as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>, the chair also includes a storage pouch <b>130</b>, armrests <b>140</b>, and/or a sun shade <b>150</b>. In an embodiment, the storage pouch <b>130</b> connects to one of the central beams <b>108</b> and provides storage space for larger articles such as a water bottle <b>132</b> or other beverage containers. The storage pouch may be easily detached from the central beams for separate storage or storage in a pocket or pouch of the chair. The armrests <b>140</b> are also coupled to the central beams <b>108</b> and are configured to fold to the position shown to support the weight of a user's arms. In one embodiment, the armrests <b>140</b> may be released (e.g., by moving a switch, pulling a pin, etc.) and folded down to be parallel with the central beams for storage. It should be appreciated that armrests need not be included, as in the chair shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>46</b></figref>. In one embodiment, the sun shade <b>150</b> is rotatably coupled to the backrest <b>106</b> and is held in place with a friction lock. That is, a user may move the sun shade when a force greater than a threshold force is applied to the sun shade, but the sun shade will remain stationary when no external force is applied. In one embodiment, the sun shade may fold flat against the backrest surface material <b>124</b> for storage.</p>
<p id="p-0101" num="0100">According one embodiment as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>, one or more surfaces of the chair <b>100</b> may include a high-friction material suitable to increase the grip of the user when operating the chair. For example, the rear base <b>105</b> and front base <b>103</b> may include a rubber or silicone pad or covering (for example, see <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>24</b></figref>) which increases the coefficient of friction between those elements and a user's foot or shoe. Such an arrangement may be desirable when folding or unfolding the chair, as the chair is less likely to slip when being manipulated. Any suitable high friction material may be employed, including, but not limited to grip tape, abrasives, etc.</p>
<p id="p-0102" num="0101"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref> is a bottom view of the chair <b>100</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref> showing one embodiment of a seating surface <b>120</b> and a wire frame <b>122</b>. According to the embodiment shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref>, the seating surface <b>120</b> is formed of a fabric or otherwise flexible material and is supported at least partially by central beams <b>108</b>. In some embodiments, the seating surface may be formed of multiple layers of material to increase durability and/or strength of the seating surface. The shape of the seating surface is at least partially defined by the wire frame <b>122</b>, which is attached to the seating surface around a perimeter of the seating surface. The wire frame <b>122</b> is coupled to the hubs <b>110</b> via wire frame mounts <b>126</b>. The wire frame is semi-rigid, and ensures the shape of the seating surface remains consistent (e.g., smooth, flat, etc.) without any bunching of the seating surface material. In one embodiment as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref>, the seating surface may be continuously formed with a backrest surface material <b>124</b>. The seating surface may include two semi-circular cutouts <b>123</b> disposed between the seating surface <b>120</b> and the backrest surface <b>124</b> which transition the seating surface to the backrest surface. According to one embodiment the seating surface <b>120</b> and wire frame <b>122</b> are formed in a rounded rectangle shape, with curved corners being curved in a manner corresponding to a curve between the front base <b>103</b> and front legs <b>102</b>A, <b>102</b>B.</p>
<p id="p-0103" num="0102"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref> is a perspective view of another embodiment of a chair <b>100</b> in a first (e.g., folded) configuration. The chair includes a front support that includes a first front leg <b>102</b>A, a second front leg <b>102</b>B, and a front base <b>103</b>. The chair also includes a rear support formed by a first rear leg <b>104</b>A, a second rear leg <b>104</b>B, and a rear base <b>105</b>. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref>, each of the front support and rear support are formed in a U-shape, with the legs extending in a direction perpendicular to the bases. The front support and rear support are connected to one another via a first central beam <b>108</b>A and a second central beam <b>108</b>B. In particular, the first front leg <b>102</b>A is rotatably coupled to the first central beam <b>108</b>A at a hinge <b>160</b>. Likewise, the second front leg <b>102</b>B is rotatably coupled to the second central beam <b>108</b>B at a hinge <b>160</b>, so that the whole of the front support is rotatable about the hinges <b>160</b>. The first rear leg <b>104</b>A of the rear support is coaxial with and slidably disposed in the first central beam <b>108</b>A and the second rear leg <b>104</b>B is coaxial with and slidably disposed in the second central beam. Accordingly, the rear support is configured to translate toward or away from the central beams as the first and second rear legs slide into or out of the central beams, respectively. In the configuration shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref>, each of the first and second front legs, as well as the first and second rear legs, are substantially parallel to the first and second central beams. Accordingly, the chair occupies minimal space in directions parallel to the plane defined by the first and second central beams when folded. Such an arrangement may be desirable for storage or portability.</p>
<p id="p-0104" num="0103">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref>, in one embodiment the chair also includes a backrest for supporting the back of a user when the chair is in an unfolded configuration. A first stile <b>106</b>A, a second stile <b>106</b>B, and a backspan or backrest rail <b>107</b> form the backrest. The backrest is coupled to the first and second central beams <b>108</b>A, <b>108</b>B via two hubs <b>110</b> connected to each of the central beams. The hubs <b>110</b> allow the backrest to rotate relative to the first and second central beams so that the backrest may be unfolded and/or reclined. The backrest also includes an actuator <b>170</b> and a pin actuator <b>180</b> which are configured to selectively allow inner stiles of the first and second stiles to slide into or out of outer stiles of the first <b>106</b>A and second <b>106</b>B stiles so that the overall length of the backrest can be increased. Such an arrangement allows the chair to have a lesser overall length when in the folded configuration shown for improved portability or storage. Embodiments of an actuator and pin actuator are described further with reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>14</b>-<b>23</b></figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0105" num="0104">According to one embodiment as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref>, the chair <b>100</b> also includes a crossbeam or crossbeam <b>101</b> and a seating surface wire frame mount <b>126</b>. The crossbeam <b>101</b> couples the hubs <b>110</b> and maintains their relative positioning. Accordingly, the crossbeam increases the rigidity of the chair under load. The seating surface wire frame mounts are configured to support a wire frame disposed in a flexible seating surface. As noted above, a wire frame may be employed to inhibit fabric from bunching or otherwise forming an irregular seating surface when the chair is unfolded.</p>
<p id="p-0106" num="0105">In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref>, the chair is in a folded configuration with each of the primary structural elements (i.e., the front support, rear support, and backrest) aligned with each other in parallel planes. The first rear leg <b>104</b>A and second rear leg <b>104</b>B of the rear support are primarily disposed in the first central beam <b>108</b>A and second central beam <b>108</b>B, so that the overall length of the beams and rear support legs are reduced. The front support <b>102</b>A, <b>102</b>B, <b>103</b> is in a folded rotational position having been rotated about hinges until substantially parallel with the first and second central beam. Thus, in the configuration shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref>, the chair is folded into a compact state for transport or storage.</p>
<p id="p-0107" num="0106"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b></figref> is a perspective view of the chair <b>100</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref> in a second configuration. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref>, the first front leg <b>102</b>A, second front leg <b>102</b>B, and front base <b>103</b> have been rotated about hinges <b>160</b> so that the front support is inclined (i.e., non-parallel) relative to the first and second central beams <b>108</b>A, <b>108</b>B. According to the embodiment of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref>, the hinges <b>160</b> may be friction hinges configured to maintain the position of the first and second front legs <b>102</b>A, <b>102</b>B when no external force from a user is applied to the legs. That is, the hinge may have sufficient friction to inhibit the front support from rotating about the hinges <b>160</b> under the effect of gravity, but a user may apply a force to rotate the front support to the position shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b></figref> (e.g., in the direction shown by the arrow in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref>). In other embodiments, the hinges <b>160</b> may allow free rotation of the first and second front legs <b>102</b>A, <b>102</b>B so that the front support may rotate to the position shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref> under the effect of gravity. In such an embodiment, a latch, strap, or other arrangement may be employed to retain the first and second front legs <b>102</b>A, <b>102</b>B in the folded configuration shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref>. Of course, any suitable arrangement may be employed to move the front support to the position shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b></figref> from the position shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref>, including, but not limited to, biasing members, latches, friction hinges, etc., as present disclosure is not so limited.</p>
<p id="p-0108" num="0107">From the configuration shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b></figref>, the chair <b>100</b> may continue to be moved to the unfolded configuration by sliding the first <b>104</b>A and second rear legs <b>104</b>B of the rear support out of the first central beam <b>108</b>A and second central beam <b>108</b>B, respectively. Additionally, the first <b>106</b>A and second <b>106</b>B stiles of the backrest may be extended. A user may perform both of these actions in series or simultaneously by applying force to the rear base <b>105</b> of the rear support and rail <b>107</b> of the backrest in the direction shown by the arrows. According to the embodiment of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref>, the user may depress or otherwise operate the actuator <b>170</b> as the force is applied so that the inner stiles may slide out of the outer stiles of the first stile <b>106</b>A and second stile <b>106</b>B. It should be noted that while the front support <b>102</b> is rotated to the position shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b></figref> before the rear support and backrest are unfolded, the chair may be unfolded in any suitable series of steps. That is, in some embodiments, the rear support and/or backrest may be unfolded to the configuration shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b></figref> before the front support is rotated about hinges <b>160</b>.</p>

As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b></figref>, the rear support and backrest have been unfolded so that the overall length of the chair in the direction of the first central beam <b>108</b>A and second central beam <b>108</b>B is increased. In particular, the first rear leg <b>104</b>A and second rear leg <b>104</b>B have been slid out of the first central beam <b>108</b>A and second central beam <b>108</b>B, respectively. Likewise, a first inner stile <b>182</b>A and a second inner stile <b>182</b>B have been slid out of the outer stile <b>181</b>A of the first stile <b>106</b>A and the outer stile <b>181</b>B of the second stile <b>106</b>B so that the overall length of the rail is increased relative to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b></figref>. In the configuration shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b></figref>, the pin actuator <b>180</b> may secure the inner stiles <b>182</b>A, <b>182</b>B relative to the first and second outer stiles <b>181</b>A, <b>181</b>B so that the length is maintained until a user operates the actuator <b>170</b>. From the configuration shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b></figref>, the backrest may be rotated about hubs <b>110</b> to the unfolded configuration shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>6</b></figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0110" num="0109"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>6</b></figref> is a perspective view of the chair of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref> in a fourth (e.g., unfolded) configuration. In the configuration shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>6</b></figref>, the chair is unfolded and may be used normally as a chair when a seating surface is installed (for example, see <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>). For example, seating surface may be suspended from the first central beam <b>108</b>A and second central beam <b>108</b>B and a seating surface wire frame may be coupled to hubs with wire frame mounts <b>126</b>. According to the embodiment shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>6</b></figref>, when the first and second stiles <b>106</b>A, <b>106</b>B are rotated about the hubs <b>110</b>, a pin disposed in the hub may secure the first rear leg <b>104</b>A and second rear leg <b>104</b>B of the rear support relative to the first central beam <b>108</b>A and the second central beam <b>108</b>B. The backrest may also be secured at the relative angle shown by the hubs <b>110</b>. Accordingly, in the configuration shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>6</b></figref>, the chair <b>100</b> may support the weight of a user seated on a seating surface and backrest surface material of the chair. According to one embodiment as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b></figref>, the angle of the backrest may be selectively controlled with trigger <b>190</b> and trigger pin <b>192</b> which are operatively coupled to the hubs to allow a user to change the angle of the backrest while seated. The functionality of the triggers and hubs will be discussed further with reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>12</b>A-<b>12</b>D</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0111" num="0110"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>7</b>A-<b>7</b>B</figref> are a first side view and top view, respectively, of the chair <b>100</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref> in the first configuration. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>7</b>A-<b>7</b>B</figref>, each of front legs <b>102</b>, rear legs <b>104</b>, central beams <b>108</b>, and stiles <b>106</b> are substantially parallel to one another when the chair is in the folded configuration. From the configuration shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>7</b>A-<b>7</b>B</figref>, the front legs <b>102</b> may be rotated about hinge <b>160</b> in the direction shown by the arrow to begin the unfolding process. Alternatively, forces may be applied to the rear base <b>105</b> and rail <b>107</b> to slide the rear support legs <b>104</b> out of the central beams <b>108</b>. Likewise, the outer stiles may be slid relative to inner stiles (for example, see <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>9</b>A-<b>9</b>B</figref>) so that the backrest is lengthened.</p>
<p id="p-0112" num="0111">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>7</b>A-<b>7</b>B</figref>, the chair <b>100</b> includes rounded ends <b>162</b> that are attached to each of the front support legs <b>102</b>. The rounded ends occupy a semi-circular space around the hinge <b>160</b>. In particular, the rounded end occupies the void created when the front support legs <b>102</b> are rotated relative to the hinge <b>160</b> so that the front support legs are in the folded configuration show in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>7</b>A-<b>7</b>B</figref>. The rounded ends create a substantially continuous surface (i.e., a curve) between the central beams <b>108</b> and the front support legs <b>102</b>. Such an arrangement reduces the likelihood of foreign objects being inserted between the central beams and the front support legs while the front support legs are folded which could interfere with operation of the chair. One embodiment of rounded ends is discussed in further detail with reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>29</b>A-<b>29</b>B</figref>. In some embodiments, the hinge <b>160</b> may be reinforced with an optional metal rib <b>162</b>. That is, at least one side of the hinge interface may be formed of a metal (e.g., sheet metal) rib overmolded with plastic. Such an arrangement may increase the rigidity and strength of the hinge. Of course, any suitable material and manufacturing method may be employed to form the hinge <b>160</b>, as the present disclosure is not so limited.</p>
<p id="p-0113" num="0112"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>8</b>A-<b>8</b>B</figref> are a first side view and top view, respectively, of the chair <b>100</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref> in the second configuration. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>8</b>A-<b>8</b>B</figref>, the front support legs <b>102</b> have been rotated out relative to hinge <b>160</b> so that the front support legs are inclined relative to the central beams <b>108</b>. From the configuration shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>8</b>A-<b>8</b>B</figref>, force may be applied in the direction shown by the arrows to extend the stiles <b>106</b> and the rear support legs <b>104</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0114" num="0113">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>8</b>A-<b>8</b>B</figref>, the front base <b>103</b> is flat relative to the ground (i.e., parallel to a horizontal plane). Accordingly, the front support legs are inclined relative to the front base by an angle, &#x3b1;, which is less than 90 degrees. In the case of a flat tube like that employed in the embodiment shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>8</b>A</figref>, the flat front base <b>103</b> is beneficial to provide a user seated in the chair with a flat surface on which to place their feet. Additionally, the greater contact surface with the ground is useful to improve loading and resiliency of the front support legs. In some embodiments, the angle of inclination of the front support legs relative to the front base <b>103</b> may be less than 80 degrees, 75 degrees, 60 degrees, 50 degrees, 45 degrees, and/or any other suitable angle. Of course, while the front base <b>103</b> is shown inclined at an angle of less than 90 degrees in the embodiment of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>8</b>A-<b>8</b>B</figref>, the base may be orthogonal to the front support legs or have an angle greater than 90 degrees, as the present disclosure is not so limited. In one embodiment, the front base <b>103</b> may be non-parallel with the ground. In such an embodiment, the front base <b>103</b> may include a covering or shroud that provides a flat surface (e.g., a surface parallel relative to a horizontal plane) on the top of the front base to provide a place for a user to place their feet. Of course, any suitable tube shape, inclination of tube, and/or front base covering may be employed, as the present disclosure is not so limited.</p>
<p id="p-0115" num="0114"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>9</b>A-<b>9</b>B</figref> are a first side view and a top view, respectively, of the chair <b>100</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref> in the third configuration. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>9</b>A-<b>9</b>B</figref>, the stiles <b>106</b> and rear support legs <b>104</b> have been extended so that the overall length of the chair along a longitudinal axis of the central beams <b>108</b> has been increased relative to the configuration shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>8</b>A-<b>8</b>B</figref>. From the state shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>9</b>A-<b>9</b>B</figref>, the backrest may be rotated relative to the hubs <b>110</b> in the direction of the arrow to complete the unfolding of the chair. According to the embodiment of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>9</b>A-<b>9</b>B</figref>, a user does not need to depress any button or switch to rotate the backrest relative to the hub, and can do so freely until the hub <b>110</b> locks the backrest in a first rotational position. Rotating the backrest relative to the hub will be described further below with reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>12</b>A-<b>12</b>D</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0116" num="0115"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>10</b>A-<b>10</b>B</figref> are a first side view and top view, respectively, of the chair <b>100</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref> in the fourth configuration. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>10</b>A-<b>10</b>B</figref>, the stiles <b>106</b>, inner stiles <b>182</b>, and rail <b>107</b> have been rotated relative to the hubs <b>110</b> and locked in a first rotational position. That is, when the backrest is in the position shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>10</b>A-<b>10</b>B</figref>, the hubs releasably lock the inner stiles <b>182</b> to inhibit further rotation in a direction toward the rear support legs without first operating a trigger <b>190</b>. However, according to the embodiment of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>10</b>A-<b>10</b>B</figref>, a user may rotate the backrest in a direction toward the central beams <b>108</b> without operating the trigger. In this direction, the hub may hold the backrest in place with a biasing force that can be overcome with sufficient force application. To rotate the backrest toward the rear support legs <b>104</b>, the trigger <b>190</b> may be pulled in the direction shown by the arrow to move trigger pin <b>192</b> to unlock the hub <b>110</b>. The backrest may then be rotated toward the rear support legs freely. In some embodiments, the hub <b>110</b> may include a torsion spring or other biasing element configured to bias the backrest toward the folded configuration where the stiles <b>106</b> are parallel with the central beams <b>108</b> (for example, see <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>12</b>A-<b>12</b>D</figref>).</p>
<p id="p-0117" num="0116"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>11</b>A-<b>11</b>B</figref> are a first side view and top view, respectively, of the chair of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref> in a fifth configuration with the backrest in a reclined position. As noted above, the trigger <b>190</b> may be operated to unlock the hub <b>110</b> to allow the inner stiles <b>182</b> and stiles <b>106</b> to rotate toward the rear support legs <b>104</b>. When a desired inclination is reached, the trigger may be released to re-lock the hub <b>110</b> and inhibit rotation of the backrest. When the trigger <b>190</b> and trigger pin <b>192</b> move in the direction shown by the arrow (e.g., return to an original position), the stiles <b>106</b> and inner stiles <b>182</b> may be inhibited from further rotation toward the rear support legs <b>104</b>, allowing a seated user's weight to be supported by the backrest. In some embodiments, the trigger and trigger pin may be biased to move in the direction shown by the arrow with a torsion spring, compression spring, tension spring, or other suitable biasing member. From the configuration shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>11</b>A-<b>11</b>B</figref>, the process shown through <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>7</b>A-<b>11</b>B</figref> may be reversed in order to move the chair to a folded configuration. In particular, the stiles <b>106</b>, and inner stiles <b>182</b> may be rotated in a direction toward the central beams <b>108</b> to initiate the folding process. When the backrest is parallel with the central beams, the inner stiles <b>182</b> may be slid into the outer stiles <b>181</b> of the stiles <b>106</b>, and the rear support legs <b>104</b> may be slid into the central support beams. Finally, the front support legs <b>102</b> may be folded (i.e., rotated about hinge <b>160</b>) until they are substantially parallel with the central beams <b>108</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0118" num="0117"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>12</b>A-<b>12</b>D</figref> depict various cross-sectional views of one embodiment of a hub <b>110</b> of the chair of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref> as the chair is moved through the configurations shown and discussed with reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>7</b>A-<b>11</b>B</figref>. In the embodiment shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>12</b>A-<b>12</b>D</figref>, the hub is configured to selectively allow rotation of the backrest relative to the hub and translation of the rear support relative to central beams. However, the hub of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>12</b>A-<b>12</b>D</figref> may be employed between any suitable tubes or beams to control the relative angles and translation of said beams, as the present disclosure is not so limited.</p>
<p id="p-0119" num="0118"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>12</b>A</figref> is a side cross-sectional view of one embodiment of a hub <b>110</b> of the chair of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref> taken along line <b>12</b>A-<b>12</b>A of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>9</b>B</figref>. The hub allows a backrest of the chair to be selectively rotated relative to the hub for unfolding and folding of the chair. Additionally, the hub controls the ability of rear support legs <b>104</b> to be slid into or out of central beams <b>108</b> of the chair, so that force may be transmitted through the central beams to the rear support legs when the chair is in an unfolded configuration. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>12</b>A</figref>, the hub includes a housing <b>112</b> and a rotational coupler <b>113</b> disposed in the housing and configured to rotate relative to the housing. The rotational coupler supports stiles <b>106</b> (or in some embodiments, inner stiles) so that the stiles are rotatable about the housing. The rotational coupler includes a plurality of locking regions <b>114</b> that are formed as notches or teeth in intervals about a portion of the circumference of the rotational coupler. Each of the locking regions functions as a set point for a particular angle of the rotational coupler where rotation of the rotational coupler is inhibited. The plurality of locking regions are configured to be engaged by a rotation lock <b>115</b>, which is also rotatably mounted in the housing <b>112</b>. In particular, according to the embodiment of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>12</b>A</figref>, the rotation lock includes a projection <b>116</b> sized and shaped to fit in each of the locking regions. The rotation lock rotates about pin <b>117</b>, which may include a torsion spring or other biasing element that urges the rotation lock into engagement with the rotational coupler <b>113</b>. As will be discussed further with reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>12</b>B-<b>12</b>D</figref>, the rotation lock may be selectively rotated into or out of engagement with the plurality of locking regions <b>114</b> to secure or unsecure the stiles <b>106</b>, respectively, to allow them to rotate when desired. A trigger coupled to trigger pin <b>192</b> may be operated by a user to move the rotation lock out of engagement with the rotational coupler.</p>
<p id="p-0120" num="0119">According to the embodiment of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>12</b>A</figref>, the hub <b>110</b> also selectively locks the rear support leg <b>104</b> relative to central beam <b>108</b> so that the rear support leg may be kept in an extended position when the chair is in an unfolded configuration. Accordingly, the hub includes a pin housing <b>118</b> that houses a blocking pin <b>119</b> that moves between a blocking position and an unblocking position. In the blocking position, the blocking pin <b>119</b> is configured to engage the rear support leg <b>104</b> (e.g., through a hole) to inhibit sliding of the rear support leg relative to the central beam <b>108</b>. In the unblocking position, the blocking pin <b>119</b> clears the rear support leg to allow the relative sliding movement of the rear support leg. According to the embodiment of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>12</b>A</figref>, the blocking pin is biased to the blocking position and is moved to the blocking position by a pin camming element <b>200</b> when the stile <b>106</b> is parallel to the central beam <b>108</b>. The specific functionality of the blocking pin and pin camming element is discussed further with reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>13</b>A-<b>13</b>B</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0121" num="0120">In the configuration shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>12</b>A</figref>, the rotation lock <b>115</b> and rotation lock projection <b>116</b> are not engaged with any of the locking regions <b>114</b>. Accordingly, the rotational coupler <b>113</b> is able to rotate relative to the housing <b>112</b> when the stile <b>106</b> is parallel to the central beam <b>108</b> so that the backrest may be easily unfolded without operating any switches or latches. Of course, in other embodiments a latch or the rotation lock may secure the stile <b>106</b> in the folded configuration, as the present disclosure is not so limited.</p>
<p id="p-0122" num="0121">In one embodiment as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>12</b>A</figref>, the hub <b>110</b> may include a torsion spring <b>111</b> or other biasing member coupled to the rotational coupler <b>113</b> and configured to bias the rotational coupler to toward a folded position when the stile <b>106</b> is parallel with the central beam <b>108</b>. The biasing force provided by the torsion spring may allow the stile <b>106</b> to be folded without application of significant external force from a user. That is, release or movement of the rotation lock <b>115</b> out of engagement with the rotational coupler may be sufficient to allow the backrest stile <b>106</b> to rotate to a parallel position with the central beam <b>108</b>. The torsion spring may also compensate for any effects of a user's weight on the backrest when the rotational lock is released, meaning the backrest stile may be reclined in a controlled manner.</p>
<p id="p-0123" num="0122">In one embodiment as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>12</b>A</figref>, the hub <b>110</b> may include a wiper <b>237</b> disposed about an opening into the hub through which the rear support leg <b>104</b> extends and retracts. In some cases, ingress of fluids (e.g., water) or particles (e.g., sand, dust, etc.) into the hub may affect performance of the hub over time. Accordingly, the wiper <b>237</b> is configured to reduce any gap between the rear support leg <b>104</b> and the hub <b>110</b>, so that any foreign fluids or particles disposed on the rear support leg are inhibited from entering the hub as the rear support legs translates into the hub. That is, the wiper may brush off any liquids or particles that may have accumulated on the rear support leg as the rear support leg is translated into the hub (i.e., retracted). In some embodiments, the wiper <b>237</b> may be composed of silicone or another suitable material for forming a close fit with the rear support leg while still allowing the rear support leg to slide into or out of the hub without significant added resistance.</p>
<p id="p-0124" num="0123"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>12</b>B</figref> is a side cross-sectional view of the hub <b>110</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>12</b>A</figref> taken along line <b>12</b>B-<b>12</b>B of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>10</b>B</figref>. Relative to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>12</b>A</figref>, the rotational coupler <b>113</b> of the hub has been rotated to a second rotational position in a direction clockwise relative to the page. Accordingly, the stile <b>106</b> is inclined relative to the central beam <b>108</b>. The configuration of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>12</b>B</figref> corresponds to a rotation lock projection <b>116</b> engaging a first locking region of the plurality of locking regions <b>114</b>. As the rotational coupler <b>113</b> was rotated relative to the housing <b>112</b>, the projection <b>116</b> was contacted by a ramp <b>121</b>, which rotated the rotation lock in direction B about the pin <b>117</b>. Once the projection <b>116</b> was aligned with the locking region, a torsion spring or other biasing element moved the rotation lock in direction C so that the projection entered the locking region. When in the locking region, the rotation lock <b>115</b> is configured to inhibit rotation of the rotational coupler in both directions of rotation to different extents as the rotation lock functions as an over-center cam lock. That is, when the rotational coupler <b>113</b> is rotated in direction C (e.g., a direction of recline or a direction increasing the angle of inclination between the central beam <b>108</b> and the stile <b>106</b>), the force is transmitted to the rotation lock along axis A-A. As axis A-A is offset from the pin <b>117</b>, a moment is applied to the rotation lock and the rotation lock correspondingly rotates the rotation lock in direction C. However, rotation of the rotation lock in direction C while the projection is already engaged with a locking region simply moves the projection into further engagement with the locking region. As C is unable to rotate, the rotational force applied to the rotational coupler <b>113</b> is resisted by pin <b>117</b>. Accordingly, the rotational coupler is unable to rotate in direction C when the rotation lock is engaged with a locking region.</p>
<p id="p-0125" num="0124">In contrast to rotation in direction C, rotation of the rotational coupler <b>113</b> in direction B (e.g., a direction of fold or a direction reducing the angle of inclination between the central beam <b>108</b> and the stile <b>106</b>) is inhibited but not prevented. When the rotational coupler <b>113</b> is rotated in direction B, the force applied along axis A-A creates an opposite moment on the rotation lock <b>115</b>. Accordingly, the rotation lock is rotated in direction B by the rotational coupler, which moves the projection <b>116</b> out of engagement with the locking region. As the rotation lock is urged to rotate in direction C, this urging force may be overcome if enough force is applied to the rotational coupler in direction B. Accordingly, a user may apply a sufficient force to overcome the threshold urging force and other associated frictional forces which maintain the projection <b>116</b> in engagement with the locking regions <b>114</b> to move the backrest in direction B. Such an arrangement may be desirable as a user may fold the backrest of the chair easily without operating any buttons or latches. The rotation lock of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>12</b>B</figref> is configured to perform the same function (i.e., inhibit rotation of the backrest in direction C while inhibiting rotation of the backrest in direction B) at each of the plurality of locking regions <b>114</b>. According to the embodiment shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>12</b>B</figref>, the rotational coupler includes three locking regions, although any desirable number of locking regions may be employed, as the present disclosure is not so limited.</p>
<p id="p-0126" num="0125"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>12</b>C</figref> is a side cross-sectional view of the hub <b>110</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>12</b>A</figref> taken along line <b>12</b>B-<b>12</b>B of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>10</b>B</figref>. According to the embodiment of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>12</b>A-<b>12</b>D</figref>, the hub <b>110</b> slidably receives a trigger pin <b>192</b> that may be associated with a trigger disposed on the central beam <b>108</b>. The trigger may be activated (e.g., rotated or moved) such that the trigger pin translates relative to the hub into our out of the hub. In the configuration of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>12</b>C</figref>, the trigger pin <b>192</b> has been operated (e.g., via a trigger disposed on central beam <b>108</b>) to move the rotation lock <b>115</b> out of engagement with the plurality of locking regions <b>114</b>. That is, the trigger pin is contacting the rotation lock to hold the projection <b>116</b> out of engagement with the first locking region against any biasing force urging the rotation lock into engagement with the rotational coupler. Accordingly, the rotational coupler <b>113</b> and attached stile <b>106</b> may be rotated in any direction by a user without inhibition from the rotation lock. For example, a user may operate the trigger pin and then rotate the stile <b>106</b> in a recline direction. As noted above, the backrest and/or rotational coupler <b>113</b> may be biased to rotate toward the central beam (i.e., in the folding direction) with a torsion spring <b>111</b> or other suitable biasing member. Accordingly, when the trigger pin <b>192</b> is operated a user seated in the chair may apply additional force to the stile to recline it, or reduce force applied to the stile to allow the leg to rotate toward the folded configuration or otherwise un-recline.</p>
<p id="p-0127" num="0126"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>12</b>D</figref> is a side cross-sectional view of the hub <b>110</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>12</b>A</figref> taken along line <b>12</b>D-<b>12</b>D of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>11</b>B</figref>.

In the embodiment of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>13</b>A-<b>13</b>B</figref>, the blocking pin moves between a blocking position where the blocking pin engages a hole in the rear leg and an unblocking position where the blocking pin disengages the hole. In this manner, relative movement of the rear leg and central beam is controlled. According to the depicted embodiment, the movement of the blocking pin between the blocking position and the unblocking position is controlled via rotation of a rotational coupler <b>113</b> in the hub.</p>
<p id="p-0129" num="0128"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>13</b>A</figref> is a cross-sectional view of the hub <b>110</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>12</b>A</figref> in the second configuration. As noted above, a blocking pin <b>119</b> and blocking pin housing <b>118</b> may be used to selectively allow movement of the rear support leg <b>104</b> relative to a central beam. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>13</b>A</figref>, the rear support leg <b>104</b> and the rotational coupler <b>113</b> are in a side-by-side arrangement within the housing <b>112</b> of the hub. The blocking pin <b>119</b> and blocking pin housing <b>118</b> are integrally formed in the embodiment of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>13</b>A-<b>13</b>B</figref> and are disposed in a slot <b>203</b> formed in the housing. The blocking pin and blocking pin housing are configured to move substantially linearly toward and away from the rear support leg in the slot. Alternatively, the blocking pin may rotate into and out of a blocking position. A biasing member <b>204</b> configured as a compression spring is disposed in the slot and urges the blocking pin toward the blocking position when the blocking pin engages the rear support leg. The blocking pin housing <b>118</b> also includes an inclined surface <b>202</b> that is configured to move the blocking pin housing in the slot when contacted by the rotational coupler <b>113</b>. The rotational coupler <b>113</b> attached to stile <b>106</b> includes a pin camming element <b>200</b> which is configured to engage the blocking pin housing <b>118</b> on the inclined surface <b>202</b> when the rotational coupler is in a predetermined position. In the embodiment of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>13</b>A</figref>, the predetermined position is when the stile <b>106</b> is parallel to a central beam and the rear support leg, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>13</b>B</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0130" num="0129"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>13</b>B</figref> is a cross-sectional view of the hub <b>110</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>12</b>A</figref> in the first configuration. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>13</b>B</figref>, the stile <b>106</b> and rotational coupler <b>113</b> have been rotated so that the stile is parallel to the rear support leg <b>104</b>. Accordingly, the pin camming element <b>200</b> has engaged the inclined surface <b>202</b> of the blocking pin housing to move the blocking pin <b>119</b> from the blocking position to an unblocking position. That is, sliding engagement of the pin camming element <b>200</b> and the inclined surface <b>202</b> of the blocking pin <b>119</b> moves the blocking pin away from the rear leg <b>104</b>. The pin camming element holds the blocking pin in the unblocking position against the urging force of the biasing member so that the rear support leg <b>104</b> is movable and able to be extended or retracted. In the unblocking position, the blocking pin clears a hole <b>109</b> formed in the rear support leg. When the rear support leg is slid to another position where the hole <b>109</b> is not aligned with the blocking pin <b>119</b>, the rear support leg may hold the blocking pin in the unblocking position. Accordingly, the rotational coupler <b>113</b> and backrest <b>106</b> may be rotated when the rear support leg hole <b>109</b> is not aligned with the blocking pin and the blocking pin will be maintained in the unblocking position. For example, when a chair is in the folded configuration a backrest may be rotated first to an unfolded configuration and then the rear support leg may be extended until the hole <b>109</b> aligns with the blocking pin <b>119</b>, as a particular order is not required when unfolding. However, in the folding direction of motion, the backrest may be moved to the folded configuration first so that the pin camming element moves the blocking pin <b>119</b> to the unblocking position before the rear support leg may be retracted. Such an arrangement ensures that a chair in an unfolded and usable configuration collapses or folds the non-weight bearing elements first to avoid inadvertent folding or collapsing of the rear support leg.</p>
<p id="p-0131" num="0130">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>13</b>A-<b>13</b>B</figref>, the stile <b>106</b> is disposed in a slot <b>206</b> formed in the hub housing <b>112</b>. The rotational coupler <b>113</b> may substantially block the slot from ingress of foreign materials such as sand and dirt in locations where the stile is not positioned. Ends of the slot may function as rotation limiters for the rotational coupler <b>113</b> and stiles <b>106</b> so that the rotational range of the rotational coupler is predefined. In some embodiments, the slot may include a gasket or a shield to provide further protection from ingress of foreign objects.</p>

For example, the blocking pin <b>119</b> may be configured to rotate about a hinge between the blocking position and unblocking position. Accordingly, the present disclosure is not so limited in this regard, and any blocking pin arrangement which allows the blocking pin to selectively control movement of the rear support leg <b>104</b> may be employed.</p>

According to the embodiment of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>14</b></figref>, the pin actuators and actuators are connected with sheathed cables <b>172</b>. Operation of the actuator tensions a cable of the sheathed cables to activate the pin actuators <b>180</b>.

As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>15</b></figref>, the backrest release actuator includes a button <b>170</b> which has includes pin actuator slots <b>171</b>A, <b>171</b>B. The button is configured to move into and out of a button housing <b>179</b>. The button housing includes second pin actuator slots <b>174</b>A, <b>174</b>B which overlap at least partially with the first pin actuator slots <b>171</b>A, <b>171</b>B. Each of the sheathed cables <b>172</b> is coupled to a sliding actuator carrier <b>176</b>A, <b>176</b>B. In particular, cables of the sheathed cables <b>172</b> are coupled to the sliding actuator carrier so that the cables may be tensioned as the actuator carriers slide. The sliding actuator carriers include pins <b>177</b> that are disposed in each of the first pin actuator slots <b>171</b>A, <b>171</b>B and second pin actuator slots <b>174</b>A, <b>174</b>B. That is, one pin is disposed in a pair of overlapping pin actuator slots <b>171</b>A, <b>174</b>A and another pin is disposed in the other pair of overlapping pin actuator slots <b>171</b>B, <b>174</b>B.

Accordingly, when the button <b>170</b> is depressed, the inclined first pin actuator slots will move the pins <b>177</b> along the second pin actuator slots. In the embodiment of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>15</b></figref>, the pins will move toward one another and away from their respective sheathed cable <b>172</b> so that the actuator carriers <b>176</b>A, <b>176</b>B tension the cables of the sheathed cables.</p>

The pin release actuator is configured to selectively move a backrest blocking pin from a blocking position to an unblocking position via a backrest pin head <b>186</b>. When the backrest blocking pin is in the blocking position and has engaged the inner stile <b>182</b>, the outer stile <b>181</b> may be inhibited from sliding relative to the inner stile. That is, the pin release actuator <b>180</b> is secured to the outer stile <b>181</b> and the backrest blocking pin may engage a hole in the inner stile so that axial force may be transmitted between the stile and inner stile. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>17</b>-<b>18</b></figref>, the pin release actuator includes a pin release carrier <b>184</b> that is attached to an inner wire <b>173</b> of a sheathed cable <b>172</b> at a cable attachment portion <b>183</b>. The pin release carrier <b>184</b> is configured to slide in the pin release actuator when the wire <b>173</b> is tensioned (e.g., when an actuator is activated elsewhere on the chair). The pin release carrier <b>184</b> includes inclined pin engagement surfaces <b>185</b>. The inclined pin engagement surfaces engage the backrest pin head <b>186</b> when the pin release carrier <b>184</b> is slid under tension from the cable. As the inclined pin engagement surfaces engage the backrest pin head, the backrest blocking pin is moved away from the inner stile and into the unblocking position where the backrest blocking pin clears the inner stile. According to the embodiment of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>17</b></figref>, the backrest pin head <b>186</b> includes a carrier engagement surface <b>187</b>, which is parallel to the inclined pin engagement surface, although other surface angles may be employed. Accordingly, in the unblocking position the outer stile <b>181</b> may be slid relative to the inner stile <b>182</b> to lengthen or shorten the overall length of the backrest. The inner stile may include any suitable number of holes or engagement positions for the backrest blocking pin, as the present disclosure is not so limited. Additionally, the backrest blocking pin may be biased toward the blocking position so that the stile is secured in one or more engagement positions automatically.</p>
<p id="p-0137" num="0136">It should be noted that the actuator and pin release arrangement shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>14</b>-<b>18</b></figref> may be employed on any desirable portion of the chair, which includes tubular members sliding relative to one another.

The housing <b>222</b> includes a first slot <b>224</b>A and a second slot <b>224</b>B, which form a track for first and second backrest actuator pins <b>226</b>A, <b>226</b>B to move. That is, in the depicted embodiment, the backrest actuator pins move along the slots to correspondingly apply tension via cables connected to each of the backrest actuator pins. The backrest actuator <b>220</b> includes a first inclined surface <b>221</b>A and a second inclined surface <b>221</b>B, which, in the current embodiment, face a center of the backrest actuator housing. Accordingly, as the backrest actuator is moved into the backrest rail (i.e., towards the backrest actuator pins <b>226</b>A, <b>226</b>B), the inclined surfaces <b>221</b>A, <b>221</b>B contact the backrest actuator pins <b>226</b>A, <b>226</b>B and urge them toward the center of the backrest actuator housing along the slots <b>224</b>A, <b>224</b>B. Accordingly, cables attached to the backrest actuator pins are pulled toward the backrest actuator, thereby applying tension to the cable and transferring that tension to an associated pin release actuator.</p>
<p id="p-0140" num="0139">According to the one embodiment as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>20</b>-<b>21</b></figref>, the backrest release actuator is configured to enable simple assembly.

When the backrest actuator is separate from the backrest actuator housing, the retaining clips may be deformed as the backrest actuator is inserted into the backrest actuator housing, such that the slips snap into place once the backrest actuator is fully inserted into the housing. This process may not interfere with the backrest actuator pins <b>226</b>A, <b>226</b>B, allowing for easy installation of the backrest actuator.</p>
<p id="p-0141" num="0140">In one embodiment, the backrest actuator <b>220</b> shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>20</b>-<b>21</b></figref> may include a biasing member (e.g., a compression spring, torsion spring, etc.) which biases the backrest actuator away from the backrest rail <b>107</b>.

<p id="p-0145" num="0144"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>23</b></figref> is an enlarged cross-sectional view of the pin release actuator <b>230</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>22</b></figref>. As discussed above, the pin release actuator includes a backrest pin carrier <b>232</b> and a backrest blocking pin <b>234</b>. The backrest blocking pin <b>234</b> is rotatably coupled to the backrest pin carrier at a backrest pin hinge <b>235</b>, which allows the backrest blocking pin to rotate between blocking and unblocking positions. The backrest blocking pin is coupled to the cable <b>172</b> at an end of the backrest blocking pin opposite the backrest pin hinge, where the cable <b>172</b> is retained in the backrest blocking pin with a flange <b>233</b>. Accordingly, an inner wire <b>173</b> or cord may be used to apply a tension force to the backrest blocking pin to move the backrest blocking pin from a blocking position to an unblocking position. In the position shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>23</b></figref>, the backrest blocking pin <b>234</b> is in the blocking position and is disposed in a backrest pin hole <b>189</b> formed in the inner backrest stile, and, in some embodiments, the backrest stile <b>106</b>. Accordingly, the backrest blocking pin blocks movement of the inner backrest stile relative to the backrest stile. When tension is applied to the backrest blocking pin via the cable <b>172</b>, the blocking pin is rotated in a counterclockwise direction relative to the page about backrest pin hinge <b>235</b>. Correspondingly, the backrest blocking pin is withdrawn from the backrest pin hole <b>189</b> and the inner backrest stile is free to slide into or out of the backrest stile. In one embodiment, the backrest pin hinge may include a torsion spring or other biasing element to bias the backrest blocking pin toward the blocking position. In such an embodiment, when an associated actuator is released the blocking pin may rotate about the hinge in a clockwise direction relative to the page to re-engage the backrest pin hole.

As discussed above, a front leg <b>102</b> is rotatably coupled to a central beam <b>108</b> at a hinge <b>160</b>, which allows the front leg to rotate between folded and unfolded positions. In one embodiment as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>29</b>A-<b>29</b>B</figref>, the front leg includes rounded ends <b>162</b> that occupy the space between the front leg and the central beam as the front leg is rotated to a folded configuration. In the embodiment shown, the rounded ends are formed in the center of the front leg and fit into a corresponding slot <b>164</b>, formed in the central beam <b>108</b>. The rounded ends are circularly shaped such that when the front leg is rotated to a folded configuration shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>29</b>B</figref> the rounded end occupies a gap that would otherwise form between the front leg and the central beam. Put another way, the rounded ends create a substantially continuous surface between the central beam and the front leg regardless of the angle of the front leg relative to the central beam. Such an arrangement inhibits the introduction of foreign objects into a gap between the front leg and central beam, which may otherwise interfere with rotation of the front leg.</p>
<p id="p-0154" num="0153">According to one embodiment as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>29</b>A</figref>, a chair may include a trigger <b>190</b> disposed on a central beam <b>108</b> which is actuable to control a hub of a chair (for example, see <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>12</b>A-<b>12</b>D</figref>). In one embodiment, the trigger is rotatably coupled to the central beam at trigger pivot <b>193</b> so that the trigger is rotatable between actuated and non-actuated positions. The trigger may be coupled to a trigger pin <b>192</b>, which transfers the rotational motion of the trigger between the actuated and non-actuated positions into substantially linear motion.

Accordingly, the hub of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>40</b></figref> has the same functionality as the hub of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>12</b>A-<b>12</b>D</figref>, but the surface area for water or particle collection and ingress is reduced. That is, rather than a slot formed in a cylindrical surface <b>261</b> of the hub, a single hole accommodating the shaft <b>264</b> is employed. Such a hole may be further sealed (e.g., with a sealed bearing) to further inhibit water and particle ingress. According to the embodiment of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>40</b></figref>, the backrest stile connector <b>262</b> allows the backrest stile to rotate about the hub across a cylindrical surface <b>261</b> of the hub. That is, the backrest stile connector is formed so that the backrest stile is held inward relative to the hub of an attachment location between the shaft <b>264</b> and the backrest stile connector <b>262</b>. Put another way, the backrest stile connector wraps around the hub inward relative to the side of the hub (e.g., into the page). Of course, the backrest stile connector may have any suitable configuration and the backrest stile may be disposed inward or outward relative to the hub, as the present disclosure is not so limited.</p>
<p id="p-0172" num="0171"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>41</b></figref> is a side view of another embodiment of a front leg <b>102</b> and central beam <b>108</b>.

<p id="p-0178" num="0177"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>47</b>A</figref> is a perspective view of yet another embodiment of a chair <b>100</b> including a carrying strap <b>300</b> in a first configuration. In the embodiment depicted in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>47</b>A</figref>, the carrying strap <b>300</b> is configured to convert between a shoulder strap (e.g., forming a single loop), and backpack straps (e.g., forming two loops). As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>47</b>A</figref>, the carrying strap includes a shoulder pad <b>302</b> which is disposed around the carrying strap. In one embodiment, the shoulder pad may include a hook-and-loop fastener flap such that the shoulder pad can wrap around and attach to other components of the chair, as will be explained below. Of course, any suitable fastener may also be employed to secure the shoulder pad to another component of the chair, including buttons, snap, zippers, etc. The carrying strap <b>300</b> may be adjustable by employing a slide adjuster <b>304</b> which allows the strap to be lengthened or shortened. The carry strap includes two attachment loops <b>306</b> which are secured around buttons <b>270</b>. In the depicted embodiment, the attachment loops <b>306</b> are secured around buttons disposed on an interface between the front legs <b>102</b> and central beams <b>108</b>. In this way, the carrying strap may be disposed beneath the seating surface when the chair is in the use position. Of course, the carrying strap <b>300</b> may be secured around any suitable button or attachment location on the chair, as the present disclosure is not so limited. In the configuration shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>47</b>A</figref>, the carrying strap <b>300</b> is in a single loop between two buttons <b>270</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0179" num="0178">In the embodiment shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>47</b>A</figref>, the crossbeam <b>101</b> extends between hubs <b>110</b>. An attachment component <b>308</b> may be connected to or otherwise disposed on the crossbeam. In one embodiment, the attachment component is an elastic band <b>308</b>.

As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>47</b>B</figref>, the shoulder pad <b>302</b> has been wrapped around the crossbeam <b>101</b>. In one embodiment, a hook-and-loop fastener flap of the shoulder pad may be fastened around the crossbeam <b>101</b>, such that the shoulder pad <b>302</b> and carrying strap are secured to the crossbeam. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>47</b>B</figref>, the shoulder pad <b>302</b> is positioned between the rail <b>101</b> and the elastic band <b>308</b>. The elastic strap maintains the central position of the shoulder strap relative to the hub. Put another way, the elastic strap inhibits the shoulder pad <b>302</b> from sliding along the crossbeam. In some embodiments, the carrying strap <b>300</b> is able to slide through the shoulder pad <b>302</b> while the shoulder pad is secured to the crossbeam <b>101</b>, such that a user may adjust the relative length of each of the two loops. The slide adjuster <b>304</b> may be used to extend the length of the carrying strap to correspondingly extend the length of the two loops. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>47</b>B</figref>, the carrying strap <b>300</b> may hang underneath the central beams <b>108</b>. Accordingly, the carrying strap <b>300</b> may not interference with the use of the chair when in the unfolded configuration. That is, the carrying strap <b>300</b> may be positioned to the sides and underneath a seating surface of the chair, such that the carrying strap does not interfere with sitting in the chair. Likewise, when the carrying strap is in the single loop configuration shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>47</b>A</figref>, the strap may remain out of the way and may not interfere with use of the chair. According to the embodiment shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>47</b>B</figref>, the carrying strap may not interfere with the movement of the chair between folded and unfolded configurations. That is, the chair shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>47</b>B</figref> may be folded according to exemplary embodiments described herein without interference of the carry strap <b>300</b>.</p>

As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>47</b>C</figref>, the shoulder pad <b>302</b> is secured to the crossbeam <b>101</b>. The shoulder pad <b>302</b> is received in the elastic band <b>308</b>, which keeps the shoulder pad in a central location on the crossbeam <b>101</b>. The carrying strap is secured to buttons <b>270</b> via loops <b>306</b>. Accordingly, the carrying strap forms two loops which may be worn on both shoulders like a backpack. Such an arrangement may facilitate carrying when the chair is in a folded configuration as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>47</b>A</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0182" num="0181">Alternatively, in another embodiment shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>47</b>D</figref> with the carrying strap shown detached from the attachment component, the attachment component is a rigid bar <b>308</b><i>a </i>fixed at its ends to the crossbeam. The central portion of the rigid bar is spaced away from the outer surface of the crossbeam to create a space <b>309</b> through which a strap of the shoulder pad can extend. Thus, a portion of the shoulder pad may be inserted in the space between the crossbeam and the rigid bar (similar to the embodiment described above with respect to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>47</b>A-<b>47</b>C</figref> where the shoulder pad slips between the elastic strap and the crossbeam). In this embodiment, however, the shoulder pad may be secured to the rigid bar or to the crossbeam where a hook-and-loop fastener flap of the shoulder pad may be fastened around the crossbeam <b>101</b> or the rigid bar. With the rigid bar being generally centrally disposed along the crossbeam, the shoulder pad is thus retained in generally at a central portion of the crossbeam <b>101</b> such that the carrying strap forms two relatively equal length backpack strap portions. It should be appreciated that no attachment component is necessary and instead the shoulder pad can be attached directly to the crossbeam. Also, the shoulder pad may be formed of or include a higher friction material such that when the pad is fastened to a seat component, the pad remains relatively stationary.</p>

<p id="p-0188" num="0187"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>50</b></figref> is a cross-sectional view of the hub <b>360</b> of the chair of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>49</b></figref> taken along line <b>50</b>-<b>50</b>. According to the embodiment of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>50</b></figref>, the hub <b>360</b> is similar in operation to that of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>12</b>A-<b>12</b>D</figref>. The hub includes a rotational coupler <b>400</b> having a plurality of locking regions <b>402</b>. The rotational coupler is connected to backrest stiles <b>356</b> via backrest connectors <b>361</b>. The hub also includes a locking lever (i.e., rotation lock) <b>404</b> which is configured to rotate about pin <b>408</b>. The locking lever includes two projections <b>406</b> which have a corresponding shape to the locking regions <b>402</b>. The locking lever <b>404</b> is arranged such that the projections and locking regions form an over-center lock, whereby the backrest stiles <b>356</b> are prevented from moving in one direction while threshold force in the other direction disengages the projections from the locking regions. In particular, the backrest stiles <b>356</b> are prevented from moving in a recline direction when the two projections <b>406</b> are engaged with corresponding locking regions <b>402</b>. In the opposite direction, a threshold force applied to the backrest stiles <b>356</b> may cam the projections <b>406</b> out of engagement with the locking regions such that the backrest may be rotated towards the central beams <b>358</b>. According to the embodiment shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>50</b></figref>, the rotational coupler has three rotational positions in which the rotational coupler is locked by the locking lever <b>404</b>.

The rotational coupler may include a spring mount <b>412</b> operatively supporting a torsion spring <b>413</b> which biases the rotational coupler <b>400</b> in a fold direction (i.e., opposite a recline direction). Of course, while a torsion spring is shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>50</b></figref>, any suitable spring or biasing member may be employed, such as compression or tension springs, as the present disclosure is not so limited.</p>
<p id="p-0189" num="0188">According to one embodiment as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>50</b></figref>, the hub <b>360</b> includes a rear leg pin <b>416</b>. Similar to the embodiment discussed with reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>13</b>A-<b>13</b>B</figref>, the rear leg pin <b>416</b> is configured to selectively lock the translation of the rear leg <b>354</b> into the central beam <b>358</b>. That is, the rear leg pin selectively moves into and out of an aperture formed in the rear leg <b>354</b> to inhibit axial movement of the rear leg relative to the hub <b>360</b> and central beam <b>358</b>. According to the embodiment of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>50</b></figref>, the backrest leg pin <b>416</b> is configured to secure the rear leg <b>354</b> when the rear leg is fully extended and the backrest stile <b>356</b> is rotated out of a folded configuration (i.e., in a recline direction). The rear leg pin may be biased (e.g., with a spring) to engage the rear leg <b>354</b>. According to the embodiment of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>50</b></figref>, the rear leg pin is configured to rotate about an axis substantially parallel to an axis of translation of the rear leg <b>354</b>. That is, the rear leg pin may rotate into or out of the page to selectively engage the rear leg. Of course, other axes of rotation are contemplated, including axes of rotation disposed in a plane substantially parallel to the axis of translation of the rear leg, and the present disclosure is not so limited in this regard. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>50</b></figref>, the rotational coupler <b>400</b> includes a rear leg pin engagement tab <b>417</b> which is configured to engage the rear leg when the backrest stile <b>356</b> is rotated to a position in which the backrest stile is substantially parallel with the central beam <b>358</b> (e.g., a folded configuration). The rear leg pin engagement tab <b>417</b> may lift the rear leg pin (e.g., with an inclined surface) out of engagement with the rear leg <b>354</b>, such that the rear leg is free to translate into and out of the central beam <b>358</b>. In some embodiments, the hub <b>360</b> and/or rear leg <b>453</b> may include a ball detent <b>415</b> configured to retain the rear leg <b>354</b> in an extended position prior to the rear leg pin <b>416</b> engaging the rear leg. That is, the ball detent may retain the rear leg in an extended position until the backrest stile <b>356</b> is unfolded to allow the rear leg pin <b>416</b> to engage the rear leg <b>354</b>. In one embodiment, the ball detent is disposed in the rear leg <b>345</b> and configured to engage a recess or slot formed in a portion of the hub <b>360</b>. The ball detent may be biased with a suitable biasing member (e.g., compression spring). Of course, any suitable arrangement to hold the back leg in an extended position prior to being locked into place by the rear leg pin <b>416</b> may be employed, as the present disclosure is not so limited.</p>
<p id="p-0190" num="0189"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>51</b></figref> is a cross-sectional view of the hub <b>360</b> of the chair of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>49</b></figref> taken along line <b>51</b>-<b>51</b>. The cross section shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>51</b></figref> shows the exterior arrangement of the rotational coupler <b>400</b> which is coupled to a backrest connector <b>361</b>. In the depicted embodiment, the rotational coupler <b>400</b> includes a slot <b>401</b> configured to accommodate the pin <b>408</b> supporting the locking lever <b>404</b>. The ends of the slot <b>401</b> may function as stops to prevent rotation of the backrest stiles <b>356</b> out of a rotational range.

The rear leg wiper is disposed around a perimeter of the rear leg <b>354</b> and is configured to inhibit ingress of sand, water, and other particles from entering the hub or central beam <b>358</b>. In some embodiments, the rear leg wiper <b>422</b> may be formed a complaint material, such that the rear leg wiper may form a loose seal with the rear leg <b>354</b>. For example, the wiper may be formed of rubber, silicone, or another suitable material.</p>
<p id="p-0193" num="0192"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>53</b></figref> is a cross-sectional view of a backrest release actuator <b>450</b> of the chair of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>48</b></figref> taken along line <b>53</b>-<b>53</b>. According to the embodiment of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>53</b></figref>, the backrest release actuator is disposed on a top or upper surface of the backrest stiles <b>356</b>. In particular, the backrest release actuator protrudes out of an aperture <b>359</b> such that it is accessible by a user. In some embodiments as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>53</b></figref>, the backrest release actuator <b>450</b> may be covered by a compliant covering <b>357</b> which allows the backrest release actuator to be pressed by a user while inhibiting sand, water, and/or other particulates from entering the backrest stiles <b>356</b> via the aperture <b>359</b>. In some embodiments, the compliant covering <b>357</b> may be removable to allow access to the backrest release actuator <b>450</b> for tuning, cleaning, and/or servicing.</p>
<p id="p-0194" num="0193">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>53</b></figref>, the backrest release actuator <b>450</b> includes opposing inclined surfaces <b>452</b>A, <b>452</b>B that are configured to engage and move slider pins <b>454</b>A, <b>454</b>B. In particular, when the backrest release actuator is depressed (i.e., moved further into the backrest stiles <b>356</b>), the inclined surfaces <b>452</b>A, <b>452</b>B force the slider pins <b>454</b>A, <b>454</b>B outward relative to one another. Put another way, a first slider pin <b>454</b>A is moved leftward relative to the page and a second slider pin <b>454</b>B is moved rightward relative to the page, opposite directions from one another. Similar to embodiments previously discussed with reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>15</b>-<b>16</b> and <b>20</b>-<b>21</b></figref>, the slider pins <b>454</b>A, <b>454</b>B are each coupled to tethers <b>458</b>A, <b>458</b>B which are in turn coupled to backrest blocking pins (e.g., via a backrest pin actuator) disposed in the backrest stiles <b>356</b>. The tethers <b>458</b>A, <b>458</b>B may be a cable, wire, nylon cord, string, or another other appropriate material for transferring tension between the slider pins <b>454</b>A, <b>454</b>B and a backrest pin actuator or backrest blocking pin. According to the embodiment of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>53</b></figref>, tension is increased in the tethers <b>458</b>A, <b>458</b>B when the backrest release actuator <b>450</b> is depressed and the slider pins <b>454</b>A, <b>454</b>B are moved outward. Additionally, the tethers <b>458</b>A, <b>458</b>B cross over one another to engage the slider pins <b>454</b>A, <b>454</b>B. Such an arrangement may be beneficial to adjust the tension of both the tethers <b>458</b>A, <b>458</b>B with a single tension adjuster <b>457</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0195" num="0194">According to one embodiment as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>53</b></figref>, the backrest release actuator <b>450</b> may include a tension adjuster <b>457</b> configured to adjust the tension in the tethers <b>458</b>A, <b>458</b>B. The tension adjuster is coupled to the backrest release actuator <b>450</b> via a screw <b>456</b> which may be turned to adjust the position of the tension adjuster relative to the backrest release actuator <b>450</b>. The tension adjuster is in contact with the tethers <b>458</b>A, <b>458</b>B and adjustment of the tension adjuster may take up slack in the tethers (i.e., apply tension), thereby allowing the tension in the tethers to be set by a user when the backrest release actuator is in an unactuated (i.e., undepressed) position. The arrangement of the tension adjusted to maintain tension in the tethers <b>458</b>A <b>458</b>B also allows the tensioned tethers to function as biasing members that bias the backrest release actuator to the unactuated position shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>53</b></figref>. That is, the tension in the tethers may apply a normal force against the inclined surfaces <b>452</b>A, <b>452</b>B, such that the backrest release actuator is urged outward relative to the backrest stiles <b>356</b> (i.e., upward relative to the page). Such an arrangement may simplify the construction of the backrest release actuator. Of course, in other embodiments a separate biasing member such as a compression spring may be employed with the backrest release actuator <b>450</b>, as the present disclosure is not so limited.</p>
<p id="p-0196" num="0195"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>54</b></figref> is an elevation view of an embodiment of a sun shade <b>370</b>. The sun shade <b>370</b> is configured in a two portion arrangement, having a first adjustable portion <b>375</b> and a second adjustable portion <b>377</b>. The first adjustable portion and second adjustable portion are independently rotatable relative to one another. The first portion is coupled to a sun shade bracket <b>372</b> via first hinges <b>374</b>, while the second portion is coupled to the first portion via second hinges <b>376</b>. Each of the first hinges and second hinges are configured to releasably maintain a relative rotational position of the first portion and second portion, as will be discussed further with reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>55</b></figref>. In some embodiments, the sun shade <b>370</b> is configured to fold backward to be substantially parallel with backrest stiles. Of course, the sun shade <b>370</b> may be folded and moved to any suitable rotational position, as the present disclosure is not so limited. In some embodiments, a fabric covering for the sun shade <b>370</b> may be arranged such that there is a gap or opening between fabric covering the first portion <b>375</b> and fabric covering the second portion <b>377</b>. Such an arrangement may be beneficial to mitigate the effects of wind on the sun shade.</p>
<p id="p-0197" num="0196">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>54</b></figref>, the sun shade brackets <b>372</b> have shape configured to corresponding to a shape of a backrest of a chair. In the embodiment of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>54</b></figref>, the brackets have an arcuate shape. The brackets <b>372</b> each include a plurality of holes <b>373</b> which may receive one or more fasteners for securing the brackets to a corresponding chair. For example, in one embodiment, the holes <b>373</b> are configured to receive buttons. Of course, any suitable fastener such as screws, bolts, etc. may be employed, as the present disclosure is not so limited.</p>
<p id="p-0198" num="0197"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>55</b></figref> is an exploded view of one embodiment of a sun shade hinge <b>374</b> configured to allow a rotational position of a portion <b>375</b> of the sun shade to be adjusted and maintained by a user. According to the embodiment of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>55</b></figref>, the sun shade hinge <b>374</b> is configured as a biased Hirth coupling. A first section <b>380</b> of the hinge is coupled secured to a second section <b>382</b> of the hinge with a biased bolt <b>378</b>. That is, a tension spring or other biasing member biases the first section <b>380</b> toward the second section <b>382</b>, while still accommodating relative displacement of the second section from the first section. The first section <b>380</b> includes a first plurality of circumferentially arranged teeth <b>381</b>, and the second section <b>382</b> includes a second plurality of circumferentially arranged teeth <b>383</b> configured to engage the first plurality of teeth <b>381</b>. The teeth <b>381</b>, <b>383</b> are arranged such that up to a threshold force the teeth prevent relative rotational movement of the first section and second section. Once a threshold force (e.g., torque) is applied, the normal forces between the teeth <b>381</b>, <b>383</b> overcomes the biasing force from the biased bolt <b>378</b> and the first section and second section disengage from one another such that the second section <b>382</b> may be rotated relative to the first section <b>380</b> while the threshold force is applied. Accordingly, the second section <b>382</b> may be moved to a desired position and released, whereupon the biased bolt <b>378</b> may urge the second section back into engagement with the first section, thereby maintaining the set rotational position.</p>
