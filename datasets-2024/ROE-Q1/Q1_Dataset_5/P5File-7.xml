<heading level="1" id="h-0001">TECHNICAL FIELD</heading>
<p id="p-0002" num="0001">The present application relates to apparatuses, methods, and systems for the production of alternative protein-based meat substitutes and to supervisory machine intelligence controls for such apparatuses, methods, and systems.</p>
<heading level="1" id="h-0002">BACKGROUND</heading>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">Human population growth and socio-demographic changes are placing increased pressure on natural resources to provide more and different types of food. Proteins are one of the key nutrients for the human diet. Animal-based proteins from meat are an increasingly popular and important source of protein for the human diet, however, the ecological impact of animal farming and meat production is also a significant and growing problem. Alternative protein-based meat substitutes, such as plant protein-based meat substitutes and insect protein-based meat substitutes, offer an alternative food source that seeks to provide or exceed the nutritional benefits of meat.</p>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">A significant challenge for alternative protein-based meat substitutes is providing desired aesthetic and physical characteristics (for example, taste, texture, toughness, appearance, and cooking behavior, which are both aesthetic and physical characteristics) that emulate or exceed those of animal-based meat. Controlling the aesthetic characteristics of alternative protein-based meat substitutes is a complex problem impacted by multiple variables including ingredient characteristics (for example, the chemical composition, physical composition and structure, purity, and other characteristics of the ingredients and additives introduced into the process) and process settings (for example, ingredient feed rate, process flow rates, process temperatures, and other control parameters).</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref> is a schematic diagram depicting certain aspects of a prior art system <b>100</b> for producing an alternative protein-based meat substitute product. In system <b>100</b>, one or more human operator(s) <b>102</b> generates a recipe <b>104</b> including ingredients <b>106</b> to be provided to a wet extrusion process machine <b>112</b> and process settings <b>110</b> which are provided to a machine controller <b>103</b> configured to control the operation of the wet extrusion process machine <b>112</b>. The wet extrusion process machine <b>112</b> includes one or more feeders <b>114</b> which supply one or more respective ingredients <b>106</b> to an extruder <b>108</b> which includes one or more rotating screws <b>116</b> which are disposed and rotatable within a stationary barrel or chamber <b>118</b> defining a length of a processing path.</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">The ingredients <b>106</b> may include, for example, one or more alternative protein powders (for example, plant-based flours and/or insect-based flours), water, and oil, and may also include additives, fillers, processing aids, and the like. The one or more feeders <b>114</b> introduce the ingredients <b>106</b> into the extruder <b>108</b> at various locations along the length of the processing path. The extruder <b>108</b> mixes and advances the ingredients <b>106</b> along the length of the processing path, controls the temperature at different locations along the length of the processing path, and extrudes a processed mixture through a die <b>120</b>. The extruded processed mixture may then undergo one or more post-processing operations <b>124</b> to configure the processed mixture output from die <b>120</b> into the final form of a meat substitute product <b>126</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">The process settings <b>110</b> may include quantities or rates of introduction of the ingredients <b>106</b>, rotation speed of the one or more screws <b>116</b>, temperature, pressure, and/or humidity settings at one or more locations along the length of the processing path, and other operational settings of wet extrusion process machine <b>112</b>. The system <b>100</b> relies on adjustment input <b>122</b> from the one or more human operator(s) <b>102</b> to adjust the ingredients <b>106</b>, processing settings <b>110</b>, and post-processing operations <b>124</b>. Adjustment input <b>122</b> is based on the operator(s) inspection and evaluation of a product under process at one or more points in the process (for example, product samples taken from the output of die <b>120</b> or at one or more points in post-processing operations <b>124</b>) in order to achieve the desired characteristics of the meat substitute product <b>126</b> and therefore depends on the operator(s) expertise and experience.</p>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">Heretofore, achieving desired aesthetic characteristics for alternative protein-based meat substitutes has required reliance on human expertise and experience achieved through costly trial-and-error repetition. This imposes several disadvantages and limitations. For example, because achieving the desired aesthetic characteristics depends on the experience of individual human experts, production is exposed to the risk of the experts&#x2019; unavailability. Additionally, while machine intelligence control techniques are known to be useful in some contexts, they are highly process-specific and have not been developed to the point of general applicability to process control. Furthermore, such techniques have proven inefficient or ineffective in a number of applications. Even using general forms of such techniques, adapting a process towards optimized and customized food products is a time-consuming proposition and may require weeks and months of trial and error based experiments, with limited changes for and degrees of success. Lack of relevant information on key parameters has been another obstacle to both human expert control and machine intelligence control approaches. A further confounding variable is the presence of compositional complexity such as non-Newtonian and nonlinear fluid behaviors which are exhibited by alternative protein-based meat substitute product materials. Unknown variation in ingredient inputs is a yet another confounding hindrance. There remains a significant unmet need for the unique apparatuses, methods, systems, and techniques disclosed herein.</p>
