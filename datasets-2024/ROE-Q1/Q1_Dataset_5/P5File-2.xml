<heading id="h-0002" level="1">FIELD OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">This invention relates to vegetation wall systems. More particularly, the invention is directed to a vegetation wall system capable of monitoring at least one aspect of the system for anomalous conditions.</p>
<heading id="h-0003" level="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">This section provides background information related to the present disclosure which is not necessarily prior art.</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">Built environments, such as commercial buildings, offices, retail stores, factories, urban infrastructure, and homes, have effects on the wellbeing, productivity and mood of its occupants. Adding plants and light to built environments can greatly improve the wellbeing, profitability, work productivity and air quality of their occupants. Plants provide cleaner air by absorbing carbon dioxide in the surrounding environment. However, the disbursement of plants requires maintenance. To survive, plants require adequate heat, light, water, and fertilizer. Further, sparsely placed, potted plants may not provide adequate coverage for a built environment.</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">Plant walls may provide more coverage for built environments. However, they also require significant maintenance. Surface temperature, light illumination, flow rate, water composition, and water level are just some of the important features of plant life and health. Currently, plant owners and maintainers must constantly monitor these variables and respond to the system when one or more of these features is not operating optimally.</p>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">A need exists for a self-maintaining, aesthetically pleasing device for growing plants in built environments.</p>
<heading id="h-0004" level="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading>

A wireless router <b>365</b> may be installed on top of the light fixture <b>108</b>. In operation, a programmable logic control unit (&#x201c;PLCU&#x201d;) or units <b>360</b> are plugged into the light fixture <b>108</b> or the pump <b>330</b> or both.</p>
<p id="p-0048" num="0047"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b></figref> depicts a perspective view of one aspect of a tank <b>340</b>. The tank includes a front wall <b>402</b>, side walls <b>404</b> and an opening <b>406</b> in the lid <b>345</b> of the tank to allow water to return into the tank <b>340</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0049" num="0048"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b></figref> depicts one aspect of a programmable logic control unit (&#x201c;PLCU&#x201d;) <b>360</b> used to monitor and control various aspects of the vegetation wall system. The PLCU <b>360</b> includes a central processing unit (&#x201c;CPU&#x201d;) <b>502</b>, an input/output unit <b>504</b>, secondary storage <b>506</b>, memory <b>508</b>, and a communications interface unit <b>510</b>. A plurality of sensors <b>512</b> and control units are communicatively coupled to the input/output unit <b>504</b>. The sensors <b>512</b> may include temperature sensors, liquid detection sensors, flow sensors, pressure sensors, or any other type of sensor. The control units may include relays, transducers, pulse width modulating units, or any other type of control unit. The communication interface unit <b>510</b> may be any known communication interface unit <b>510</b> that can communicate using known communication protocols, including BACnet, Echelon, TCP/IP, Ethernet, or any other communication protocol. In some aspects, the sensor <b>512</b> is a dual technology sensor. In other aspects, the sensor <b>512</b> is part of a wireless sensor network.</p>
<p id="p-0050" num="0049">The vegetation wall system may be configured to or the PLCU <b>360</b> may be programmed to monitor various aspects of the vegetation wall system including the surface light illumination of the system, the moisture level in each vegetation holding unit, media panel, or vegetation housing unit, the flow rate of water through the system, the level of the tank, and any other monitored aspect. The PLCU <b>360</b> may comprise a timer. Further, the vegetation wall system may be configured to or PLCU <b>360</b> may be programmed to control various devices, including the pump <b>330</b> or the lighting <b>108</b>, in response to the readings from at least one sensor. In some examples, the vegetation wall system may be configured to or the PLCU <b>360</b> may be programmed to control various devices in response to the readings from two or more sensors. As an illustrative example, a light measuring sensor may be mounted on the vegetation wall system to measure the illuminated intensity of the vegetation wall system. If the intensity exceeds a predetermined value, a light <b>370</b> may be dimmed to reduce the amount of light projected to the surface. The program may incorporate a peripheral, integral, derivative loop (&#x201c;PID loop&#x201d;) to continue to dim the lighting to reduce the intensity. In one aspect, each light is controlled by the PID loop independently. In another aspect, each light is synchronized by the PID loop. The PLCU <b>360</b> may be configured to receive data from various transmitters, including weather satellites, global positioning satellites (GPS), or from the official National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) (time).</p>
<p id="p-0051" num="0050">The vegetation wall system, using, for example, a processor, may monitor the level of water in the tank <b>340</b> using a level sensor, such as an ultrasonic level sensor. If the level of the tank <b>340</b> drops below a predetermined threshold, the vegetation wall system may provide an alert or a response such as providing power to a solenoid valve on a water feed line to fill the tank <b>340</b>. In one example, the tank <b>340</b> may hold 18 inches of water, and 0-4 inches of water may be outside the threshold range. In another example, the tank <b>340</b> may hold 4 inches of water, and 0-2 inches of water may be outside the threshold range. In another example, a user may specify a unique range based on a predetermined amount of water above the inlet of the pump.</p>
<p id="p-0052" num="0051">As another illustrative example, if the level of the tank <b>340</b> drops below a predetermined threshold, the vegetation wall system may trigger an alert, for example, an electronic message to a service technician to fill the tank <b>340</b>. As another illustrative example, the vegetation wall system using, for example, a processor may monitor the moisture level of at least one vegetation mounting unit or media panel <b>106</b> to determine if adequate moisture is getting to the plants. If the moisture level drops below a predetermined level, the PLCU <b>360</b> may provide power to the pump <b>330</b> to provide water to the vegetation wall system.</p>
<p id="p-0053" num="0052"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>6</b></figref> depicts a method of monitoring at least one aspect in the vegetation wall system <b>100</b>. First, a sensor <b>512</b> of the vegetation wall system <b>100</b> is configured to measure a first component and a second component in the vegetation wall system <b>600</b>. Second, a processor may determine a change in the at least one aspect based on the first component, the second component, and the amount of time between the measurement of the first component and the second component <b>620</b>. Third, the processor may determine whether the change in at least one aspect is outside a threshold range <b>630</b>. In response to determining that the change in the at least one aspect is outside the threshold range, the processor may determine that an anomalous condition exists <b>640</b>. Finally, the processor may generate an alert in response to determining that an anomalous condition exists <b>650</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0054" num="0053">By way of even more specific example, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>7</b></figref> illustrates a method of monitoring changes in water level in a vegetation wall system using a sensor <b>512</b>. Specifically, monitoring for (i) overwatering, (ii) underwatering and/or (iii) low water levels in the tank. A wireless router <b>365</b> transmits sensor data to an internet of things (I) software-as-a-service (SaaS) solution platform <b>730</b> via a secure cellular network <b>720</b>. The advantage of this system is that no WiFi access is required. This feature can prove useful as the vegetation wall system may be placed in areas where WiFi is unavailable. A wireless network data provider provides redundant cellular connectivity to the wireless router <b>365</b>. The IoT-SaaS platform <b>730</b> displays irrigation system state along with key product, customer, and maintenance provider information. The IoT-SaaS platform <b>730</b> also generates an alert notifying a user (for example, via email <b>740</b>) if an anomalous condition is detected so it may be triaged and resolved. The wireless router allows remote monitoring, provisioning, and updating of the router network and router-based software applications <b>750</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0055" num="0054">In some examples, the vegetation wall system <b>100</b> comprises sprinklers or a drip line that are/is configured to run for not more than a minute. In these instances, to detect for overwatering, the sensors <b>512</b> detect a first water level within the tank <b>340</b> and detect a second level within the tank <b>340</b> at least 6 minutes after detecting the first level, alternatively at least 5 minutes, alternatively at least 4 minutes, alternatively at least 3 minutes, alternatively at least 2 minutes, or alternatively at least 1 minute. However, the amount of time between the detection of the first water level and the second water level may also be dependent on the flow rate of the irrigation system <b>355</b>. In these examples, if the sensors <b>512</b> detect overwatering, in addition to generating an alert, the vegetation wall system using, for example, the PLCU <b>360</b> may reduce the time that the pump <b>330</b> operates.</p>
<p id="p-0056" num="0055">In some examples, service technicians or other users may accidentally disable or reset the sprinklers or drip line. This may result in underwatering of the vegetation wall system <b>100</b>. In these instances, to detect for underwatering, the sensors <b>512</b> detect a first water level within the tank <b>340</b> and detect a second level within the tank <b>340</b> at least 12 hours after detecting the first level, alternatively at least 24 hours, alternatively at least 36 hours, alternatively at least 48 hours, alternatively at least 60 hours, or alternatively at least 72 hours. In these examples, if the sensors <b>512</b> detect underwatering, in addition to generating an alert, the vegetation wall system using, for example, the PLCU <b>360</b> may increase the time the pump operates.</p>
<p id="p-0057" num="0056">In some examples, the water in the tank <b>340</b> of the vegetation wall system <b>100</b> may be low. This could be, for example, due to environmental conditions or overwatering of the vegetation wall system <b>100</b>. In some examples of the vegetation wall system <b>100</b>, the tank <b>340</b> may hold 18 inches of water and 0-4 inches of water may be outside the threshold range. In another example, the tank <b>340</b> may hold 4 inches of water and 0-2 inches of water may be outside the threshold range. In another example, less than half of the volume of the tank <b>340</b> may be outside the threshold range. In another example, a user may specify a unique range based on a predetermined amount of water above the inlet of the pump. In these examples, if the sensors <b>512</b> detect a low tank level, in addition to generating an alert, the vegetation wall system using, for example, the PLCU <b>360</b> may reduce the time that the pump <b>330</b> operates.</p>
<p id="p-0058" num="0057">Monitoring levels of the water in the tank <b>340</b> may also provide a user information regarding the operation of the pump <b>330</b> or the flow rate of the irrigation system <b>355</b>. As such, in some examples, sensors <b>512</b> are configured to monitor the specific flow rates at predetermined times. In these examples, in addition to generating an alert, if a processor determines the flow rate is lower than a specified threshold value the processor may increase the time the pump <b>330</b> operates. However, if the processor determines that the flow rate is higher than a specified threshold value, the processor may decrease the time the pump <b>330</b> operates or disable the pump <b>330</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0059" num="0058">The vegetation wall system may be configured to monitor and remedy multiple vegetation wall system aspects simultaneously. It may be configured to monitor the operation of the pump of the vegetation wall system, the flow rate of water through an irrigation system of the vegetation wall system, and the moisture level in at least one vegetation holding unit, media panel, or vegetation housing unit of the vegetation wall system simultaneously or independently. Potential anomalous conditions related to these aspects include overwatering, under-watering, low tank level, the water in the tank falls to a predetermined level above a pump inlet, insufficient amount of water delivered to at least one vegetation holding unit, media panel, or vegetation housing unit of the vegetation wall system, insufficient amount of water delivered to the entire vegetation wall system, insufficient moisture content of at least one vegetation holding unit, media panel, or vegetation housing unit of the vegetation wall system, insufficient moisture content of the entire vegetation wall system, irrigation line failure, a flow rate above a specific, desired rate or range, and a flow rate below a specific, desired rate or range. The vegetation wall system then generates an appropriate alert or system response to remedy the anomalous condition or conditions. For example, in this configuration, the vegetation wall system would include a liquid detection sensor (or sensors) and a flow sensor (or sensors). The vegetation wall system may also be configured to monitor and remedy individual vegetation holding unit, media panel, or vegetation housing unit <b>106</b> of the vegetation wall system <b>100</b> independently of each other or simultaneously.</p>
<p id="p-0060" num="0059"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>8</b></figref> depicts a method of monitoring the water level in a tank <b>340</b> of the vegetation wall system <b>100</b>. First, a sensor <b>512</b> of the vegetation wall system <b>100</b> may measure a first component level of water in the vegetation wall system <b>800</b>. Second, a processor may direct the sensor <b>512</b> to wait a predetermined period of time <b>810</b>. Third, the sensor <b>512</b> may measure a second component level of water in a tank <b>340</b> of the vegetation wall system <b>820</b>. Fourth, the processor may determine whether the change in water level is outside the threshold range <b>830</b>. If the change in water level is outside the threshold range, the processor may determine that an anomalous condition exists <b>840</b>. Fifth, the processor may generate an alert in response to determining that an anomalous condition exists <b>850</b>. Finally, the processor may activate a system response within the vegetation wall system <b>100</b> that is remotely deployed and/or managed or automatically deployed. This includes, but is not limited to, providing power to a solenoid valve on a water feed line to fill the tank <b>860</b>. In this aspect, no human intervention is necessary, as the processor watches, monitors, and adjusts the anomalous condition. However, in another aspect, instead of activating a system response within the vegetation wall system <b>100</b>, an alert may be generated directing a technician to fill the tank.</p>
<p id="p-0061" num="0060"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>9</b></figref> depicts a method of monitoring two aspects of a vegetation wall system simultaneously. A first sensor of the vegetation wall system <b>100</b> is configured to measure a first component and a second component in the vegetation wall system <b>900</b>. Then, a processor may determine a change in a first aspect based on the first component, the second component, and the amount of time between the measurement of the first component and the second component <b>910</b>. Then, the processor may determine whether the change in the first aspect is outside a threshold range <b>920</b>. In response to determining that the change in the first aspect is outside the threshold range, the processor may determine that an anomalous condition exists <b>930</b>. At the same time, a second sensor of the vegetation wall system <b>100</b> is configured to measure a third component and a fourth component in the vegetation wall system <b>940</b>. Then, the processor may determine a change in the second aspect based on the third component, the fourth component, and the amount of time between the measurement of the third component and the fourth component <b>950</b>. The processor may determine whether the change in the second aspect is outside a threshold range <b>960</b>. In response to determining that the change in the second aspect is outside the threshold range, the processor may determine that an anomalous condition exists <b>970</b>. Finally, the processor may generate an alert in response to determining that an anomalous condition exists for either the first aspect, second aspect, or both aspects <b>980</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0062" num="0061">As an example, the vegetation wall system may monitor for insufficient water, a system-wide condition that results in the entire vegetation wall system getting too little water. Sensors <b>512</b> may configured to monitor the level of water in the tank, and if the water level is not being lowered at the appropriate rate, then the processor may determine that an anomalous condition exists. The processor may then generate an alert in response to determining that the anomalous condition exists which includes providing an alert to replace a pump or timer, change the timer settings, or the system response comprises adjusting the timer setting.</p>
<p id="p-0063" num="0062">In another example, the vegetation wall system may monitor for irrigation line failure, a condition that is specific to an irrigation line that results in only a portion of the wall receiving too little water. This could be due to a clog in the irrigation line or a faulty irrigation system, sensors <b>512</b> may be configured to monitor the moisture content of a media panel, vegetation holding unit, or vegetation housing unit in a specific location. If the moisture measurements do not meet a threshold value the processor may determine that an anomalous condition exists. The processor may then generate an alert in response to determining that the anomalous condition exists which includes providing an alert to replace a pump or a timer, change the timer settings, fill the tank, replace or clean the irrigation line or the system response comprises adjusting the timer setting.</p>
<p id="p-0064" num="0063">In some examples, the vegetation wall system can monitor for both insufficient water and irrigation line failure simultaneously.</p>
<p id="p-0065" num="0064">In an example, the vegetation wall system is configured to monitor the water level of one or more vegetation panel units <b>106</b> via a sensor <b>512</b>, and the irrigation system (i.e., by measuring the flow rate and tank levels) via a sensor <b>512</b>, simultaneously. If the water level of the vegetation panels units is found to be below a minimum threshold and the irrigation system is determined to be running properly via the sensors <b>512</b>, the vegetation wall system will generate an alert, for example notifying a technician that there may be a clog in the water line.</p>
<p id="p-0066" num="0065">In another example, if the irrigation system is running properly, but the water level of one or more of the vegetation panel units <b>106</b> is found to be above a specified range, the processor may generate an alert, for example notifying a technician to reprogram the timer(s) for the irrigation system, or the vegetation wall system may remedy the anomalous condition without human interaction by changing the length of time the timers are on within the system <b>355</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0067" num="0066">In another example, the vegetation wall system may be configured to monitor the water level of the tank <b>340</b> and the flow rate of water through the irrigation system <b>355</b> simultaneously. If the flow rate is within a normal specified range and the tank level is above a normal, specified range, the vegetation wall system will generate an alert, for example notifying a technician that the opening <b>406</b> on the lid may be clogged.</p>
<p id="p-0068" num="0067">In another example, the vegetation wall system may be configured to monitor the water level of the tank <b>340</b> and the flow rate of water through the irrigation system <b>355</b> simultaneously. If the flow rate is below a normal specified range and/or the tank level is unchanging, the vegetation wall system will generate an alert, for example notifying a technician that the pump <b>330</b> may be broken or are in need of replacement.</p>
<p id="p-0069" num="0068">In another example, if the vegetation wall system stops receiving a transmission from any of the one or more of the sensors <b>512</b> within a specified period of time, the vegetation wall system will generate an alert, for example notifying a technician that the sensors may be broken or are in need of replacement.</p>
<p id="p-0070" num="0069">In addition to monitoring the level of water in the tank of the vegetation wall system, monitoring the operation of the pump of the vegetation wall system, monitoring the flow rate of water through an irrigation system of the vegetation wall system, or monitoring the moisture level in at least one vegetation holding unit, media panel, or vegetation housing unit of the vegetation wall system, another aspect of the method may include monitoring the surface light intensity of the vegetation wall system, monitoring the composition of the water in an tank of the vegetation wall system, and monitoring the surface temperature of at least one location on the vegetation wall system.</p>
<p id="p-0071" num="0070">Monitoring the composition of water may include monitoring the level of chemicals, elements, nutrients, anions, or cations in the water of the tank <b>340</b> of the vegetation wall system <b>100</b>. The first and second components may be specified levels of a given chemical, element, nutrient, anion, or cation, and an anomalous condition may be the level of that chemical, element, nutrient, anion, or cation in the water above or below a threshold amount. In one example, the first and second components may be levels of chlorine. In another example, they may be levels of dissolved oxygen. The vegetation wall system may be configured to monitor the composition of water that may include different types of sensors such as nutrient sensors capable of measuring different plant nutrients, including those found the fertilizers, such as nitrogen, phosphorus, potassium, calcium, magnesium, sulfur, boron, manganese, iron, zinc, molybdenum, copper, dissolved oxygen and/or chlorine, total organic carbon sensor, turbidity sensor, conductivity sensor, pH sensor, and/or oxygen-reduction potential sensor. The sensor may monitor the system for anomalous conditions such as ineffectively low levels of such nutrients, or dangerously high levels of such nutrients and the vegetation wall system may generate an appropriate response to remedy the anomalous condition or notify a technician.</p>
<p id="p-0072" num="0071">Monitoring of the surface temperature includes a method where the first and second components may be the surface temperature of a specific location on the vegetation wall system <b>100</b>. In this aspect, the sensor <b>512</b> is a temperature sensor, the first component is a first temperature and the second component is a second temperature and the anomalous condition is that the temperature is above a threshold level or below a threshold level. The method may also be used to monitor the surface light illumination of the vegetation wall system <b>100</b>. The sensor <b>512</b> may be a surface light sensor, and the first component may be a first level of light illumination and the second component may be a second level of light illumination. In response to determining that an anomalous condition exists for either aspect, the system may dim or increase the amount of light projected to the surface of the system. The vegetation wall system may also generate an alert response that turns the lights on (or off) for a shorter or longer period of time to remedy the anomalous condition. In other examples, the vegetation wall system will generate an alert notifying a technician to manually turn the lights on or off. If one or more of the lights are faulty or have burned out, the system will generate an alert notifying a technician to replace the light or lights.</p>
