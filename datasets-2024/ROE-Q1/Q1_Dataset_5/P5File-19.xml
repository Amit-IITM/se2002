<heading id="h-0002" level="1">FIELD</heading>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">Methods and devices are provided for minimally invasive surgery, and in particular for providing virtual control panel of a surgical instrument.</p>
<heading id="h-0003" level="1">BACKGROUND</heading>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">Minimally invasive surgical (MIS) instruments are often preferred over traditional open surgical instruments due to the reduced post-operative recovery time and minimal scarring. Laparoscopic surgery is one type of MIS procedure in which one or more small incisions are formed in the abdomen and a trocar is inserted through the incision to form a pathway that provides access to the abdominal cavity. The trocar is used to introduce various instruments and tools into the abdominal cavity, as well as to provide insufflation to elevate the abdominal wall above the organs. The instruments and tools can be used to engage and/or treat tissue in a number of ways to achieve a diagnostic or therapeutic effect. Endoscopic surgery is another type of MIS procedure in which elongate flexible shafts are introduced into the body through a natural orifice.</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">Although traditional minimally invasive surgical instruments and techniques have proven highly effective, newer systems may provide even further advantages. For example, traditional minimally invasive surgical instruments often deny the surgeon the flexibility of tool placement found in open surgery. Difficulty is experienced in approaching the surgical environment with the instruments through the small incisions. Additionally, the added length of typical endoscopic instruments often reduces the surgeon's ability to feel forces exerted by tissues and organs on the end effector. Furthermore, coordination of the movement of the end effector of the instrument as viewed in the image on the television monitor with actual end effector movement is particularly difficult, since the movement as perceived in the image normally does not correspond intuitively with the actual end effector movement. Accordingly, lack of intuitive response to surgical instrument movement input is often experienced. Such a lack of intuitiveness, dexterity, and sensitivity of endoscopic tools has been found to be an impediment in the increased the use of minimally invasive surgery.</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">Over the years a variety of minimally invasive robotic systems have been developed to increase surgical dexterity as well as to permit a surgeon to operate on a patient in an intuitive manner. Telesurgery is a general term for surgical operations using systems where the surgeon uses some form of remote control, e.g., a servomechanism, or the like, to manipulate surgical instrument movements, rather than directly holding and moving the tools by hand. In such a telesurgery system, the surgeon is typically provided with an image of the surgical environment on a visual display at a location remote from the patient. The surgeon can typically perform the surgical procedure at the location remote from the patient whilst viewing the end effector movement on the visual display during the surgical procedure. While viewing typically a three-dimensional image of the surgical environment on the visual display, the surgeon performs the surgical procedures on the patient by manipulating master control devices at the remote location, which master control devices control motion of the remotely controlled instruments.</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">While significant advances have been made in the field of minimally invasive surgery, there remains a need for improved methods, systems, and devices for providing virtual control panel of a surgical instrument.</p>

<heading id="h-0006" level="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION</heading>
<p id="p-0026" num="0025">Certain exemplary embodiments will now be described to provide an overall understanding of the principles of the structure, function, manufacture, and use of the devices and methods disclosed herein. One or more examples of these embodiments are illustrated in the accompanying drawings. Those skilled in the art will understand that the devices and methods specifically described herein and illustrated in the accompanying drawings are non-limiting exemplary embodiments and that the scope of the present invention is defined solely by the claims. The features illustrated or described in connection with one exemplary embodiment may be combined with the features of other embodiments. Such modifications and variations are intended to be included within the scope of the present invention.</p>
<p id="p-0027" num="0026">Further, in the present disclosure, like-named components of the embodiments generally have similar features, and thus within a particular embodiment each feature of each like-named component is not necessarily fully elaborated upon. Additionally, to the extent that linear or circular dimensions are used in the description of the disclosed systems, devices, and methods, such dimensions are not intended to limit the types of shapes that can be used in conjunction with such systems, devices, and methods. A person skilled in the art will recognize that an equivalent to such linear and circular dimensions can easily be determined for any geometric shape. Sizes and shapes of the systems and devices, and the components thereof, can depend at least on the anatomy of the subject in which the systems and devices will be used, the size and shape of components with which the systems and devices will be used, and the methods and procedures in which the systems and devices will be used.</p>
<p id="p-0028" num="0027">The systems, devices, and methods disclosed herein can be implemented using a robotic surgical system. WIPO Patent Publication No. WO 2014/151621 filed on Mar. 13, 2014 and entitled &#x201c;Hyperdexterous Surgical System&#x201d; is incorporated by reference.</p>
<p id="p-0029" num="0028">In general, a surgical system is described that allows a user (e.g., a surgeon) to control the operation of surgical instruments. In particular, the surgical instruments controlled by the described system are advanced surgical tools, for example, endocutters, and/or tools that have functionalities including at least one of cutting tissue, stapling tissue, and delivering energy to tissue. The controls of advanced tools may not be easily mapped to those of standard robotic tools (e.g., graspers, needle drivers etc.). Therefore, there is a need to develop control systems that allow a user to seamlessly control advanced surgical tools during surgery. The systems and methods described herein, however, are not limited to advanced surgical tools, and can be applied to virtually any surgical instrument used in a surgical procedure, including robotic tools.</p>
<p id="p-0030" num="0029">During a minimally invasive procedure, or any surgical procedure in which the surgical instrument is outside of the surgeon's natural field of view, an image of the surgical environment as well as relevant portions of the surgical instrument is typically generated and displayed on a display to the surgeon, such as on a video monitor. Such an image is typically displayed in real-time. In aspects of the system described herein, the image of the surgical instrument is modified to include a virtual control panel. The surgeon (or any other user) can interact with the control panel through a user interface device (e.g., one that is able to move in 3D space). The control panel can be pinned to a fixed location in the display, or can be moved to various locations in the modified image. For example, the location of the control panel can be fixed relative to a portion of the surgical instrument (e.g., shaft of a surgical instrument), and the control panel can follow the surgical instrument as it moves in the modified image. The control panel can change in size, shape, aspect ratio, and perspective to match the 2D or 3D orientation of the surgical instrument and/or the surrounding environment. Moreover, the control panel can appear in two dimensions (if viewed on a 2D display) or in three dimensions ((if viewed stereoscopically via headset, goggles, or glasses). The control panel can be configured to eliminate or minimize any obstruction to the field of view of the surgical environment. For example, portions of the control panel can be transparent or semi-transparent, and the degree of transparency can be adjustable. Alternately or additionally, the surgeon can change the location of the control panel in the modified image, for example, by dragging and dropping the control panel to a desired location.</p>
<p id="p-0031" num="0030">A control panel can be customized for the surgical system and/or the instrument and/or for a particular procedure or use of the surgical system or instrument. For example, the operating parameters of an endocutter are different from those of a needle driver or an energy-delivering tool, and therefore, the control panel of an endocutter may be different from that of needle driver or an energy-delivering tool. Additionally, the relevant operating parameters of a surgical instrument may change based on the needs of a surgical procedure at any given time. For example, once an endocutter has been positioned in a desired location and clamped on a target tissue, the relevant operating parameters may include articulation angle, knife position, timing of jaw opening, and firing etc. The image of the control panel that is displayed after the endocutter has been clamped onto tissue will include the control for the operating parameters mentioned above.</p>
<p id="p-0032" num="0031"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref> is a perspective view of one embodiment of a surgical robotic system <b>100</b> that can be used in telesurgery. The system <b>100</b> includes a patient-side portion <b>110</b> that is positioned adjacent to a patient <b>112</b>, and a user-side portion <b>111</b> that is located a distance from the patient, either in the same room and/or in a remote location. The patient-side portion <b>110</b> generally includes one or more robotic arms <b>120</b> and one or more tool assemblies <b>130</b> that are configured to releasably couple to a robotic arm <b>120</b>. The user-side portion <b>111</b> generally includes a vision system <b>113</b> for viewing the patient <b>112</b> and/or surgical environment, and a control system <b>115</b> for controlling the movement of the robotic arms <b>120</b> and each tool assembly <b>130</b> during a surgical procedure.</p>
<p id="p-0033" num="0032">The control system <b>115</b> can have a variety of configurations and it can be located adjacent to the patient, e.g., in the operating room, remote from the patient, e.g., in a separate control room, or it can be distributed at two or more locations. As an example of a dedicated system, a dedicated system control console can be located in the operating room, and a separate console can be located at a remote location. The control system <b>115</b> can include components that enable a user to view a surgical environment of a patient <b>112</b> being operated on by the patient-side portion <b>110</b> and/or to control one or more parts of the patient-side portion <b>110</b> (e.g., to perform a surgical procedure at the surgical environment <b>112</b>). In some embodiments, the control system <b>115</b> can also include one or more manually-operated input devices, such as a joystick, exoskeletal glove, a powered and gravity-compensated manipulator, or the like. These input devices can control teleoperated motors which, in turn, control the movement of the surgical system, including the robotic arms <b>120</b> and tool assemblies <b>130</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0034" num="0033">The patient-side portion can also have a variety of configurations. As depicted in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>, the patient-side portion <b>110</b> can couple to an operating table <b>114</b>. However, in other embodiments, the patient-side portion <b>110</b> can be mounted to a wall, to the ceiling, to the floor, or to other operating room equipment. Further, while the patient-side portion <b>110</b> is shown as including two robotic arms <b>120</b>, more or fewer robotic arms <b>120</b> can be included. Furthermore, the patient-side portion <b>110</b> can include separate robotic arms <b>120</b> mounted in various positions, such as relative to the surgical table <b>114</b>. Alternatively, the patient-side portion <b>110</b> can include a single assembly that includes one or more robotic arms <b>120</b> extending therefrom.</p>
<p id="p-0035" num="0034"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref> is a schematic view of an example of surgical system <b>200</b> configured to generate modified images of a surgical environment (e.g., surgical instrument <b>204</b>, target tissues, tissues surrounding target tissues, etc.) in real-time. The surgical system <b>200</b> includes a surgical instrument <b>204</b>, a controller <b>202</b> to control the operation of the surgical instrument <b>204</b>, a camera module <b>210</b> configured to capture visible-light images of the surgical instrument <b>204</b>, and relay one or more signals related to the captured image to a processor <b>216</b>. The processor <b>216</b> can also communicate with the controller <b>202</b>. For example, the processor can receive operating parameters of the surgical instrument <b>204</b> from the controller <b>202</b>, and transmit to the controller <b>202</b> control signals that can change the operating parameters. The processor <b>216</b> can communicate with a database <b>218</b> which can store information related to the surgical instrument <b>204</b> (e.g., control panel information). The processor <b>216</b> can generate a modified image that includes the visible-light image from the camera <b>210</b>, and a virtual control panel that allows a user to control the operating parameters of the surgical instrument <b>204</b>. The modified image can be displayed on a display <b>222</b>, which can be wall or table mounted or on an accessory worn by the surgeon. The surgical system <b>200</b> also includes an input device <b>224</b> which can communicate with the processor <b>216</b>. A user (e.g., surgeon) can interact with the modified image (e.g., change operating parameters in the control panel) using the input device <b>224</b>. Signals in the surgical system <b>200</b> (e.g., between camera module <b>210</b> and processor <b>216</b>, controller <b>202</b> and processor <b>216</b>, input device <b>224</b> and processor <b>216</b>, etc.) can be communicated wirelessly (Bluetooth, WiFi, etc.) or through a data cable (e.g., optical fiber, coaxial cable, etc.).</p>
<p id="p-0036" num="0035">A light source (not shown) can generate visible light which is reflected by the surgical environment. The reflected light can be visible light (e.g., having a wavelength of about 400 nm to 800 nm) or light of a wavelength that is outside of the visible spectrum (e.g., infrared and ultraviolet light). A portion of the reflected visible-light (e.g., having a wavelength of about 400 nm to 800 nm) is captured by the camera module <b>210</b>. The camera module <b>210</b> comprises a lens <b>206</b> configured to focus visible-light onto a detector <b>212</b>. The quality of the visible-light image can be improved, for example, by placing detector <b>212</b> in the focal plane of the lens <b>206</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0037" num="0036">The detector <b>212</b> is able to detect light reflected by the surgical instrument. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref>, an exemplary detector <b>212</b> comprises an array of photosensitive sites (e.g., <b>212</b><i>a</i>-<i>c</i>, etc.), which can absorb electromagnetic radiation impinging on the site, and generate an electrical signal (e.g., voltage signal, current signal, etc.) that is representative of the impinged radiation. For example, the strength of the electrical signal can be proportional to the intensity of the impinged electromagnetic radiation. Photosensitive sites typically have a spectral range which determines the range of frequencies that can be efficiently detected by the site. For example, a silicon (Si) photosensitive site can detect visible to near infrared radiation (spectral range 400-1000 nm), and a germanium (Ge) or indium gallium arsenide (InGaAs) photosensitive site can detect near infrared radiation (spectral range 800-2600 nm). A suitable type of photosensitive site that is appropriate for the spectral range of the electromagnetic radiation that one wants to detect can be selected by a person skilled in the art.</p>
<p id="p-0038" num="0037">A photosensitive site can be configured to detect a desired wavelength (or a narrow range of wavelength around the desired wavelength) of electromagnetic radiation that lies within its spectral range by using an optical filter. The optical filter, which is placed in the path of the electromagnetic radiation directed towards the photosensitive site, filters out all radiation except for that corresponding to the desired wavelength. For example, a Si photosensitive site (e.g., <b>212</b><i>a</i>) with a green color filter will primarily detect green light (approximately 500 nm).</p>
<p id="p-0039" num="0038">In one example a detector (e.g., detectors <b>212</b>) detects an image of the surgical environment by combining the images of different regions of the object captured by various photosensitive sites in the detector. When the light reflected by the surgical instrument impinges on the detector <b>212</b>, a photosensitive site therein (e.g., <b>212</b><i>a</i>, <b>212</b><i>b</i>, <b>212</b><i>c</i>, etc.) detects a part of the reflected light that represents an image of a region of the surgical instrument. The photosensitive site then generates an electrical signal that is representative of the captured image. This electrical signal is converted to a digital signal by an analog-to-digital converter (ADC). The digital signal has discretized values that represent, for example, the intensity of the detected radiation. As will be described below, the digital signal can also include information related to the frequency (color) of the detected radiation. The values of the digital signals from the various photosensitive sites (collectively referred to as an image dataset) are representative of the image of the surgical instrument. There can be a one-to-one relationship between a digital signal value stored in the image dataset, and the photosensitive site that has produced the digital signal value (e.g., the digital signal value can include information that identifies photosensitive site that has generated the digital signal). Therefore, by identifying a digital signal value in the image dataset the photosensitive site that generated the digital value can be identified (or vice-versa). The processor then generates the image of the surgical environment from the image dataset that can be displayed on a display device <b>222</b> (e.g., a monitor). Each pixel in the display device can represent one digital signal value in the image dataset. In other words, each pixel in the display device can represent the radiation detected by a unique photosensitive site in the detector <b>212</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0040" num="0039">A colored image of a surgical environment can be generated by placing optical filters (or an array of optical filters) in the path of the electromagnetic radiation directed towards a detector. For example, an array of color filters (e.g., Bayer filter, RGBE filter, CYYM filter, CYGM filter, etc.) can be placed before an array of photosensitive sites. As a result, each photosensitive site receives electromagnetic radiation of a particular wavelength (or color). For example, for a Bayer filter, each photosensitive site detects one of red, blue or green color. The processor can use a demosaicing algorithm to process an image dataset obtained using a Bayer filter to generate a &#x201c;full-color&#x201d; image (i.e., an image with multiple colors).</p>
<p id="p-0041" num="0040">If a light optical filter is placed before the first detector <b>212</b>, it will detect a light image of the surgical environment. As a result, a light image dataset is generated (as described above) and transmitted to the processor <b>216</b>. The light image dataset can include information related to the intensity and wavelength (color) of the detected light for each photosensitive site.</p>
<p id="p-0042" num="0041">The controller <b>202</b> is configured to control the operation of the surgical instrument <b>204</b>. For example, if the surgical instrument <b>204</b> is an endocutter, the controller can change its operating parameters (e.g., articulation angle, knife position, timing of opening and firing, etc.). The controller <b>202</b> can also control the energy delivered by the surgical instrument <b>204</b> to a target tissue. For example, the controller <b>202</b> may drive an ultrasonic transducer in the surgical instrument and/or generate radio frequency energy which the surgical instrument can deliver to a tissue through an energy-delivering end effector. The controller <b>202</b> is configured to receive control signals from the processor <b>216</b> and such control signals can change the operating parameters of the surgical instrument <b>204</b>. The controller <b>202</b> can transmit a signal to the processor <b>216</b> that includes information related to the operating parameters and identity of the surgical instrument <b>204</b>. The signal may be transmitted when the controller <b>202</b> receives a request signal from the processor <b>216</b> requesting information related to the surgical instrument <b>204</b>. The controller <b>202</b> can include a memory device that has a log file which keeps track of the operating parameters of the surgical instrument <b>202</b>. The log file (or a part thereof) can be transmitted to the processor <b>216</b>. In some embodiments, the processor <b>216</b> and the controller <b>202</b> may not communicate directly. For example, their communication may be routed through one or more devices (e.g., processors, routers etc.).</p>
<p id="p-0043" num="0042">The processor <b>216</b> can identify the surgical instrument <b>204</b> and its operating parameters, for example, based on the signal from the controller <b>202</b>. Processor <b>216</b> can access information associated with the surgical instrument <b>204</b> that may be stored in the database <b>218</b> or that may be communicated to the processor from the surgical instrument itself. For example, the processor may search the database <b>218</b> for a template of a virtual control panel related to surgical instrument <b>204</b>, or it can receive such a template from the surgical instrument. The database may also contain a control panel template that has been customized by the user based on their specific requirements. The choice of the template may also be based on the operating parameters of the surgical instrument <b>204</b>. The processor <b>216</b> can modify the light image of the surgical environment obtained from the camera module <b>210</b> by superimposing the control panel <b>232</b> onto the image. The modified image can be displayed on the display <b>222</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0044" num="0043">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref>, the modified image includes the image of the surgical environment <b>230</b> and the control panel <b>232</b>. As explained above, the control panel can be located at a fixed location on the display <b>222</b> (e.g., top left, top right, bottom left, bottom right, etc.) or the location of the control panel can change, such as based on user commands. Moreover, a user can interact with the control panel <b>232</b> through the input device <b>224</b>. For example, if the input device <b>224</b> is a user interface device, processor <b>216</b> can generate a pointer in the modified image that can track the motion of the user interface device. The user can use the user interface device to scroll, drag, actuate (e.g., click, double click, etc.) on various control elements in the control panel. If the user is operating in a 3D environment (i.e., via a stereoscopic camera system) the input device <b>224</b> may appear to the user as a 3D pointer that moves within the 3D space surrounding the device and/or control panel. Based on this input, the processor <b>216</b> can generate a control signal to change one or more operating parameters, and such a control signal is transmitted to the controller <b>202</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0045" num="0044"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b></figref> illustrates an example of the control panel <b>232</b> when the surgical instrument <b>204</b> is an endocutter. As shown, the control panel <b>232</b> comprises various control elements or buttons (<b>402</b>-<b>414</b>). The user may open or close the jaws of the endocutter by actuating virtual buttons <b>402</b>, <b>404</b>, respectively. The user may change the articulation angle to the left or right by actuating virtual buttons <b>410</b><i>a </i>and <b>410</b><i>b</i>, respectively, and button <b>408</b> can be actuated to return the tool to its home position. Window <b>412</b> within control panel <b>232</b> indicates the degree of articulation associated with the surgical instrument. In another functionality, the user can control the knife action by actuating fire button <b>406</b> to cause the knife to fire. Part of the virtual control panel also includes a knife position tab <b>414</b>. In one embodiment the control elements in windows <b>412</b>, <b>414</b> can be used to change the articulation angle and the knife positon, respectively, although it is understood that windows <b>412</b>, <b>414</b> can be configured only to display information and not to enable control of the instrument.</p>
<p id="p-0046" num="0045">As noted above, a user can vary the degree of transparency of the control panel <b>232</b>. For example, if the transparency of the control panel is lowered, the visibility of the surgical environment behind the control panel decreases and vice versa. The user may want to adjust the transparency of the control panel, for example, when the control panel is overlaid on an area of the surgical environment that needs to be monitored (e.g., target tissue). Alternately, the user may move the control panel in the modified image (e.g., by dragging and dropping using the input device <b>224</b>).</p>
<p id="p-0047" num="0046">As described above, in some embodiments of the surgical system <b>200</b>, the control panel <b>232</b> can follow the motion of the surgical instrument <b>204</b> in the modified image. The processor <b>216</b> can be configured to identify the image of the surgical instrument <b>204</b> from the image of the surgical environment (obtained from the camera module <b>210</b>), and superimpose the control panel <b>232</b> at a fixed position relative to the image of the image of the surgical instrument. As the surgical instrument <b>204</b> moves, the control panel <b>232</b> follows its motion. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b></figref> illustrates an example of a modified image <b>500</b> of an endocutter <b>502</b> performing a surgical procedure on a target tissue <b>506</b>. The control panel <b>504</b> is located near the distal end of the endocutter so that it is most easily viewed by a surgeon. The control panel <b>506</b> can be configured to appear after the endocutter is locked to the location, for example, by the release of a clutch pedal by the user. In another embodiment, the control panel <b>232</b> can be located on or near the shaft of the endocutter.</p>
<p id="p-0048" num="0047">The processor can identify data related to the image of the surgical instrument <b>204</b> (e.g., endocutter) from the reflected light image dataset generated by the camera module <b>210</b>. In one embodiment, the data is identified based on a predetermined relative position between the first detector <b>212</b> and the surgical instrument <b>204</b>. In this embodiment, the camera module <b>210</b> is attached to the surgical instrument <b>204</b> such that the relative position of the surgical instrument with respect to the camera module <b>210</b> remains fixed. This can be done, for example, by having a mounting feature on the surgical instrument to which the camera module <b>210</b> can be removably attached. Devices (detector <b>212</b>, lens <b>206</b>, etc.) inside the camera module <b>210</b> can be positioned in a predetermined configuration. Alternately, the devices can be attached to piezoelectric actuators that allow them to move relative to one another. This can allow the detector to detect a sharp image of the surgical instrument. For example, it can be desirable to place the detector <b>212</b> in the focal plane of the lens <b>206</b>. Mechanical movements and thermal expansion of the camera module <b>210</b> and the devices therein can move the detectors out of the focal plane of the lens. The detectors can be adjusted back into the focal plane by the piezoelectric actuators that can be controlled by the processor <b>216</b>, or by an input from a user. The surgical instrument <b>204</b> and the camera module <b>210</b> (and the devices inside the camera module) can be adjusted to a desired predetermined position prior to the insertion of camera module <b>210</b> and surgical instrument <b>204</b> in the surgical environment. The photosensitive sites in detectors <b>212</b> that capture the image of the surgical instrument <b>204</b> can be identified based on the predetermined orientation of the detector <b>212</b> and the surgical instrument <b>204</b>. Information related to the location of the aforementioned photosensitive sites can be stored in the database <b>218</b>. The processor <b>216</b> can identify surgical instrument image data in the reflected light image dataset. This can be done, for example, by arranging the image data, captured by the photosensitive sites, in a predetermined pattern in the light image. For example, the image data captured by the photosensitive site <b>212</b><i>a </i>can be placed at a predetermined location in the visible-light dataset. Information about this relationship can be stored in an index data file in the database <b>218</b>. Based on the index data file, the processor <b>218</b> can identify the image data (from the reflected image dataset) corresponding to the image detected by the photosensitive site <b>212</b><i>a</i>. Alternately, the image data can include information that identifies the photosensitive site that generated it.</p>
<p id="p-0049" num="0048">In another embodiment, the surgical instrument is identified in the light image based on one or more markers on the surgical instrument <b>204</b>, and multiple cameras <b>610</b>, <b>612</b>, <b>614</b>, <b>616</b> are used to image the surgical environment. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>6</b></figref>, the surgical instrument <b>204</b> includes a number of markers <b>602</b>, <b>604</b>, <b>606</b>, <b>608</b> located on its surface. In one embodiment the markers are regions on the surgical instrument <b>204</b> that reflect electromagnetic radiation of a given frequency. For example, the markers can be configured to reflect light of a certain color. The color of the markers can be selected such that the color is not naturally present in the surgical environment (e.g., green, blue, etc.). The processor <b>216</b> thus identifies photosensitive sites that detect the image of the markers based on marker color. As described above, the reflected light image dataset can include, for each photosensitive site, information related to the color of the detected light. The processor can search in the reflected light image dataset for data representative of the color of the marker. The processor <b>216</b> identifies the markers <b>602</b>, <b>604</b>, <b>606</b>, <b>608</b> (and therefore the relative positions of the markers) in the reflected light image and compares this information with data from a database of surgical instruments stored in the database <b>218</b>. The database includes information related to marker color and marker position for various surgical instruments. Additionally, for a given surgical instrument, the database may include information related to the relative position of the makers in an image of the surgical instruments from multiple viewpoints. For example, the relative positions of the markers <b>602</b>, <b>604</b>, <b>606</b>, <b>608</b> in the image of the surgical instrument <b>204</b> in the embodiment of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>6</b></figref> will depend on the relative position of the camera (e.g., <b>610</b>, <b>612</b>, <b>614</b>, <b>616</b>) that captures the image.</p>
<p id="p-0050" num="0049">The processor can use an image recognition algorithm to identify the data in the visible-light dataset that represents the image of the surgical instrument. In one example the image recognition algorithm receives input information related to the position of the markers in the captured image, and information related to various surgical instruments stored in the database <b>218</b>. The processor compares the relative positions of markers in the captured image with the orientation information of markers of the devices in the database <b>218</b> by using various pattern recognition techniques. Based on this comparison, the processor can identify data representative of image of the surgical instrument in the visible-image dataset. Additionally or alternatively, the processor can use a pattern recognition algorithm and/or device database to work with devices that are not readily known to or controlled by the robotic surgical system (i.e., a hand-operated stapler, retractors, etc.) It is to be understood that markers may comprise a specific geometric shape and/or color, either as something that is applied to the device (e.g., green dots) or the color can be inherent of typical devices (e.g., silver straight jaws and blackened shaft).</p>
<p id="p-0051" num="0050">After the processor <b>216</b> identifies the image of the surgical instrument <b>204</b>, it can provide the user of the surgical system <b>200</b> with an option to choose the location of the control panel <b>232</b>. The user may drag the control panel <b>232</b> to a desired orientation relative to the image of the surgical instrument in the modified image (e.g., at the proximal or distal ends of the surgical instrument, shaft of the surgical instrument, etc.) and lock the position of the control panel <b>232</b>. As the image of the surgical instrument <b>204</b> moves in real-time, the orientation of the control panel <b>232</b> is accordingly adjusted to maintain the locked relative orientation.</p>
