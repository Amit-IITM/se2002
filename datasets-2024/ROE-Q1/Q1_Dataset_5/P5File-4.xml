<heading id="h-0002" level="1">FIELD OF DISCLOSURE</heading>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">The present disclosure relates generally to environmental treatment techniques. More specifically, embodiments of the present disclosure relate to systems and methods to distribute compositions into volumes of water, such as aquatic and/or marine environments.</p>
<heading id="h-0003" level="1">BACKGROUND</heading>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">The oceans are vast bodies of water covering 70 percent of the surface of Earth. A wide variety of marine life including plants and animals live throughout the oceans. Many parts of the oceans have the potential to harbor more, or different, types of life than they currently do. In these areas, quantity of living organisms, total biomass, and/or biodiversity is limited by low concentrations or a complete absence of specific nutrients and/or materials. Many approaches have been proposed and/or attempted to alleviate these conditions, either temporarily or permanently, but these approaches are not entirely effective or are prohibitively expensive.</p>
<heading id="h-0004" level="1">BRIEF DESCRIPTION</heading>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">Certain embodiments commensurate in scope with the originally claimed subject matter are summarized below.

<heading id="h-0006" level="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION</heading>
<p id="p-0023" num="0022">One or more specific embodiments of the present disclosure will be described below. In an effort to provide a concise description of these embodiments, all features of an actual implementation may not be described in the specification. It should be appreciated that in the development of any such actual implementation, as in any engineering or design project, numerous implementation-specific decisions must be made to achieve the developers' specific goals, such as compliance with system-related and business-related constraints, which may vary from one implementation to another. Moreover, it should be appreciated that such a development effort might be complex and time consuming, but would nevertheless be a routine undertaking of design, fabrication, and manufacture for those of ordinary skill having the benefit of this disclosure. Further, to the extent that certain terms such as parallel, perpendicular, and so forth are used herein, it should be understood that these terms allow for certain deviations from a strict mathematical definition, for example to allow for deviations associated with manufacturing imperfecti ons and associated tolerances.</p>
<p id="p-0024" num="0023">When introducing elements of various embodiments of the present disclosure, the articles &#x201c;a,&#x201d; &#x201c;an,&#x201d; and &#x201c;the&#x201d; are intended to mean that there are one or more of the elements. The terms &#x201c;comprising,&#x201d; &#x201c;including,&#x201d; and &#x201c;having&#x201d; are intended to be inclusive and mean that there may be additional elements other than the listed elements. Additionally, it should be understood that references to &#x201c;one embodiment&#x201d; or &#x201c;an embodiment&#x201d; of the present disclosure are not intended to be interpreted as excluding the existence of additional embodiments that also incorporate the recited features.</p>
<p id="p-0025" num="0024">Provided herein are environmental treatment distribution techniques that promote the intentional change of conditions of aquatic environments (e.g., coastal marine, nearshore marine, open ocean, deep ocean and/or lakes, ponds, rivers, streams, bays, wetlands and estuaries), via controlled distribution of materials such as nutrients and/or beneficial organisms, such as phytoplankton or microalgae (such as but not limited to diatoms and/or coccolithophorids), into aquatic environments. Further, dispersion and/or fertilization techniques of nutrients and/or organisms facilitate the increase and/or decrease of relative and/or absolute abundance of various aquatic organisms to achieve desired changes in relative and/or absolute abundance of various aquatic organisms, and/or to achieve other desired outcomes. The introduction of these organisms and/or materials and/or media may be entirely or partially intended to induce an effect, condition, change, lack of change, or stasis in an aquatic environment or in an environment, ecology, place, or system impacted by an aquatic environment. The changes may be local, regional, or systemic.</p>
<p id="p-0026" num="0025">In certain embodiments, the disclosed environmental treatment distribution system operates to decrease aquatic hypoxia, increase aquatic oxygenation, increase export of materials to depth, enhance fisheries. In certain embodiments, the disclosed environmental treatment distribution system operates to treat harmful algal bloom, red tide, nutrient runoff, climate change, eutrophication, fisheries related to fishing, and/or environmental changes associated with commercial presence. In certain embodiments, the disclosed environmental treatment distribution system operates to create conditions favorable to biologic growth and/or the capture of carbon dioxide or other carbon-based materials, elements, and/or molecules, with or without the intent to sequester said carbon for some period of time. In certain embodiments, the disclosed environmental treatment distribution system operates to create an algal bloom, and/or to create conditions favorable to other aquatic or non-aquatic life.</p>
<p id="p-0027" num="0026">The disclosed environmental treatment distribution system operates to distribute materials, such as nutrients and/or plankton and/or other types of organisms. By way of example, dispersed nutrients may include, but are not limited to, silica, iron, cobalt, copper, aluminum, nitrogen, phosphorous, magnesium, manganese, calcium, sodium, potassium, and carbon, all in various forms and solutions. In an embodiment, the dispersed nutrients include volcanic ash or synthetic volcanic ash (e.g., volcanic ash in combination with one or more other nutrients or volcanic ash alone without other nutrients). In an embodiment, the dispersed nutrients and/or materials may include iron, phosphorous, nitrogen, phosphorous, and silica that may or may not be in elemental form, such as part of a different, larger, or more complex molecule.</p>
<p id="p-0028" num="0027">Nutrients may be chosen due to their characteristics including but not limited to how they dissolve in different bodies and/or composition of water. Nutrients may be chosen based on visible characteristics including but not limited to grain size, grain density, grain sorting, grain morphology, solubility in water, and/or grain composition, and/or due to their chemistry including but not limited to their isotopic signature, adhesion, and surface energy components. These types of nutrients may originate from different sources, either from targeted mining practices and/or byproducts of needed industrial products that are all healthy, reasonably priced, and favorable to being introduced to aquatic environments (e.g., coastal marine, nearshore marine, open ocean, deep ocean and/or lakes, ponds, rivers, streams, bays, wetlands and estuaries).</p>
<p id="p-0029" num="0028">The distributed materials as disclosed herein may include atoms, molecules, media, metals, fibers, compounds, and biological remains of organisms, including but not limited to biologic materials, silica, carbon, carbonates, hydroxides, specific elements (e.g., silicon, aluminum, calcium, magnesium, sodium), specific molecules, specific materials which are biologic in origin, specific organisms, and/or materials with specific chemical or physical properties including but not limited to surface adhesion, density, solubility in water, pH, molar mass, and/or odor. The distributed materials may be reaction endpoints, reaction intermediates, or byproducts of other industrial processes.</p>
<p id="p-0030" num="0029">The distributed organisms may include one or more aquatic organisms. In an embodiment, the organisms may include one or more plankton types. These plankton may be of different or similar types, including but not limited to phytoplankton, zooplankton, autotrophs, diatoms, coccolithophorids, dinoflagellates, foraminifera, grazers, autotrophs, or otherwise. In an embodiment, the organisms include microalgae (phytoplankton) such as diatoms and coccolithophorids. These types of plankton and/or mixes of plankton may be chosen based on visible characteristics, or genetic characteristics, or other characteristics, any combination of characteristics, or chosen by algorithm, or chosen randomly, or chosen by some other process, or not chosen at all. These plankton may be chosen due to their characteristics in single-species populations or due to their characteristics when interacting with other organisms and/or to the water column.</p>
<p id="p-0031" num="0030">Distributed organisms may include plankton and/other organisms created with biotechnology, genetic modification, gene editing, or other techniques that enable the change, creation, limitation, and/or increase in single or multiple traits, characteristics, behaviors, activities, growth rates, compositions, sinking rates, nutrient uptake, nutrient release, and/or interaction with other biologics or non-biologics throughout the water column. Distributed organisms may include organisms intentionally bred for specific characteristics, and/or species created and/or modified using processes which can alter their characteristics, genome, or other factors, such as but not limited to bioengineering, genetic modification, or gene editing.</p>
<p id="p-0032" num="0031">Some characteristics of the distributed organisms may include but are not limited to: organism size related to biomass volume growth rates, marine biogenic calcification processes via calcifying organisms, competitive dominance within phytoplankton communities, large primary productivity contributor to oceans, light scattering vs absorption rates, defensive mechanisms from grazing activity, presence/absence of toxic species, ratio of nitrate to ammonium uptake, sunlight requirements, cell density and wall structure, cell morphology including but not limited to size, cell size, aggregate sinking speeds related to the presence of ballast material and/or calcite, bloom forming capabilities, species growth rates, efficiency of light conversion into biomass, sinking rates including but not limited to the presence of calcite and/or calcium carbonate plates and/or scales and/or silica or opal cell walls, whether remineralization process increases or decreases sinking rates, nutrient uptake and/or transport efficiency, carbon-fixing ability, carbon export ability, adaptability to changing CO<b>2</b> concentrations, ability to outcompete against other organisms, and/or how significant they are to primary productivity. The distributed organisms may be alive or not alive, preserved or not preserved, and/or may be cryogenically frozen.</p>
<p id="p-0033" num="0032">The environmental treatment distribution system may operate to selectively distribute nutrients and organisms separately and/or together (e.g., simultaneously). Depending on the location of the aquatic system and composition of the water of that aquatic system, either a singular or a multitude of specific or a mix of phytoplankton species, either by themselves or as part of a mixture of themselves and other materials and/or media, are introduced into an aquatic environment (e.g., coastal marine, nearshore marine, open ocean, deep ocean and/or lakes, ponds, rivers, streams, bays, wetlands and estuaries). The organisms and/or nutrients may be introduced into the same aquatic environment as where the effect is induced, or they may be introduced into a different aquatic environment.</p>
<p id="p-0034" num="0033">The disclosed environmental treatment distribution system may be incorporated onto aquatic vessels that may be dedicated vessels for environmental treatment or may be vessels with other commercial purposes (e.g., fishing). For example, passenger ships, cruise ships, ferries, commercial vessels under charter to move people, freight, commodities, and/or other vessels may also conduct environmental treatment as disclosed herein. The disclosed distribution system may be used in conjunction with maritime operating vessels and/or aircraft such as planes and/or helicopters, airborne and/or spaceborne and/or land-based vessels, equipment, containers, rail, ships, planes, drones, quadcopters, helicopters, jets, rockets, balloons, buoys, or other devices capable of distributing materials using the environmental distribution system as provided herein.</p>
<p id="p-0035" num="0034">In one embodiment, bioreactors to grow and replenish desired organisms to be distributed may be implemented as part of a ballast tank or other container (e.g., marine holding tanks that can be for holding marine catch such as shrimp, crabs, or specific marine organisms) in which to grow photosynthetic organisms including in a way that would make the container or tank act as a photobioreactor or a fermentation system. The bioreactor or other components of the environmental treatment distribution system may be implemented in conjunction with existing ship or vessel systems, such as the bilge system or other water or fluid transfer systems. The bioreactor or other components of the environmental treatment distribution system may be towed by another ship or vessel. The environmental treatment distribution system may include mixing systems for mixing of nutrients with organisms grown on board, prior to and/or while the organisms and/or nutrients are being transported off the ship or vessel. These mixing systems may be configured to quantify, weigh, mix, move, aggregate, and/or distribute materials for dispersion into waters, on board a ship or vessel. One embodiment facilitates the mixing of nutrients with organisms which have not been grown on board, prior to and/or while the organisms and/or nutrients are being transported off the ship or vessel.</p>
<p id="p-0036" num="0035">With the preceding in mind, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref> is a schematic illustration of an embodiment of an environmental treatment distribution system <b>50</b>, also referred to as the distribution system <b>50</b>, implemented with an aquatic vessel <b>52</b>. The distribution system <b>50</b> may be, at least in part, disposed on, coupled to, attached to, placed on or in, or tethered to the vessel <b>52</b>. In certain embodiments, the distribution system <b>50</b> may be arranged as part of an accessory vessel of a main vessel.</p>
<p id="p-0037" num="0036">The distribution system <b>50</b> includes one or more bioreactors <b>60</b> that promote growth of one or more organisms. The one or more bioreactors <b>60</b> may include multiple bioreactors <b>60</b>, and each individual bioreactor <b>60</b> may hold and promote growth conditions for a particular organism type. In one embodiment, the distribution system <b>50</b> includes multiple bioreactors <b>60</b> holding a same type of organism. In one embodiment, respective different bioreactors <b>60</b> hold different types of organisms. In addition, the distribution system <b>50</b> includes one or more nutrient containers <b>62</b>. When multiple nutrient containers <b>62</b> are present, each may hold a same or different nutrient type or mix relative to other containers <b>62</b>. The distribution system <b>50</b> includes at least one output <b>70</b> that is shaped and sized to transfer materials from the one or more bioreactors <b>60</b> and/or the one or more nutrient containers <b>62</b>. In certain cases, each bioreactor <b>60</b> and container <b>62</b> is coupled to a respective dedicated output <b>70</b>. In addition, the one or more bioreactors <b>60</b> and/or the one or more nutrient containers <b>62</b> may include vents to promote airflow. In another example, multiple bioreactors <b>60</b> and/or multiple nutrient containers <b>62</b> may share one output <b>70</b>. In one example, each output <b>70</b> includes a conduit that is fluidically coupled to at least one of the one or more bioreactors <b>60</b> and/or the one or more nutrient containers <b>62</b>. An outlet point of the at least one output <b>70</b> is positioned at or near an exterior of the vessel <b>52</b>, such that materials distributed and exiting the output <b>70</b> are distributed on or in the water when the vessel <b>52</b> is operational or otherwise in the water.</p>

For example, the transferred nutrient rich water from the environment and/or processed water (e.g., deionized or filtered) supplemented with nutrients onboard is provided to the bioreactor <b>60</b> as part of growth media and/or to replenish organism stocks. In another embodiment, environmental water is transferred as part of a mixing process for nutrients or dilution for bioreactor product, as generally discussed in more detail in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref>. The environmental water may be preprocessed and/or supplemented with nutrients.</p>
<p id="p-0039" num="0038">An individual bioreactor <b>60</b> as provided herein may include an air supply, a nutrient-rich water intake (e.g., the environmental water input <b>72</b>), an outlet (e.g., the outlet <b>70</b>), and white light source. The bioreactor housing is formed from durable materials that may be opaque or at least partially translucent or transparent to light. Further, the housing may be a single-layer or multi-layer housing. The light source may be internal or external, depending on the characteristics of the bioreactor housing. In one embodiment, the bioreactor housing is formed from an at least partially transparent material to permit light infiltration from an external light source. In an embodiment, the housing may include reflective material on inside or outside (at least partially covering interior or exterior walls) to enhance light transmission within the bioreactor <b>60</b>. The reflective material may be applied to a PVC pipe forming a housing of the bioreactor <b>60</b>. In one example, the housing may include an external shell that includes the light source and the reflective material, and the internal shell is a transparent structure that permits light infiltration and that contains the growing organism.</p>
<p id="p-0040" num="0039">A size, shape, and fill level of the bioreactor <b>60</b> can be arranged to permit light infiltration from the external or internal light source within the contained body of water to promote organism growth.

In one example, bioreactor dimensions may be monitored for appropriate growth via sensors <b>82</b> (e.g., fluorometer (measuring phycocyanin, phycoerythrin, and chlorophyll)) positioned at desired locations within the bioreactor <b>60</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0041" num="0040">The distribution system <b>50</b> includes a controller <b>80</b> (e.g., electronic controller) that controls operations of components of the distribution system <b>50</b>.

The controller <b>80</b> also controls selection of individual bioreactors <b>60</b> and/or individual nutrient containers <b>62</b>. In an embodiment, the controller <b>80</b> may also control bioreactor growth conditions. However, in other embodiments, each bioreactor <b>60</b> may include a separate controller that communicates with the controller <b>80</b> to provide bioreactor data that may be used to select an individual bioreactor <b>60</b> or determine if an individual bioreactor has grown sufficient levels of a desired organism to be distributed.

In certain cases, the bioreactor <b>60</b> may be part of a bioreactor mixing system <b>90</b> that operates to dilute or process the contents of the bioreactor <b>60</b> prior to distribution. Similarly, the distribution system <b>50</b> may also include a nutrient mixing system <b>92</b> to dissolve, mix, or process the contents of the nutrient container <b>62</b> prior to distribution in some embodiments the bioreactor mixing system <b>90</b> and the nutrient mixing system are fluidically coupled to at least one environmental water input <b>72</b>, which may be a shared input <b>72</b> or separate inputs <b>72</b>. Environmental water can be transferred directly to the bioreactor <b>60</b> or to a separate mixer <b>100</b> that also receives contents of the bioreactor <b>60</b>. Similarly, environmental water can be transferred directly to the nutrient container <b>62</b> or to a separate mixer <b>102</b> that also receives contents of the nutrient container <b>62</b>. Processor-controlled pumps <b>104</b> and valves <b>106</b> can be activated to fluidically couple or uncouple components of the distribution system <b>50</b> as shown by way of example in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref>. However, other arrangements are also contemplated, and additional or fewer pumps <b>104</b> and valves <b>106</b> may be incorporated. In the illustrated arrangement, one or more pumps <b>104</b> and valves <b>106</b> control entry of environmental water from the environmental water input <b>72</b> into the bioreactor mixing system <b>90</b> and the nutrient mixing system <b>92</b>. After mixing, the mixed compositions, including microalgae or other organisms and/or mixed nutrients, can be distributed on or in the water via the at least one output <b>70</b>, which may include a dedicated bioreactor output <b>110</b> and a dedicated nutrient output <b>112</b>. It should be understood that each bioreactor <b>60</b> and nutrient container <b>62</b> may, in certain embodiments, be coupled to shared outputs <b>70</b> or separated, dedicated outputs, depending on the arrangement of the distribution system <b>50</b>, the vessel, targeted location, and/or active weather patterns including but not limited to rainfall, currents and wave action.</p>
<p id="p-0046" num="0045">The nutrient container <b>62</b>, bioreactor <b>60</b>, and/or the mixers <b>100</b>, <b>102</b>, may include one or more stirrers, spinners, paddles, blades, pumps, and/or other features positioned on or in the system <b>50</b> (e.g., at a bottom, top, or center of the nutrient container <b>62</b>, bioreactor <b>60</b>, and/or the mixers <b>100</b>, <b>102</b>) that facilitate mixing of nutrients or organisms to achieve desired characteristics of the distributed materials. For example, nutrients in nutrient containers may be provided as dry compositions, such as dry powers. If distributed directly into the water in powder form, the nutrients may not effectively disperse. Thus, mixing the nutrients with the environmental water (or other fluid) before distribution can enhance dispersal. In an embodiment, nutrients are mixed to achieve a mixed density that is close or approximately equal to that of the environmental water. Saltwater is denser (1.02-1.03 grams per cubic centimeter [g/cm3]) than fresh (1 gc/m3). Thus, nutrients distributed in saltwater or freshwater may be mixed to achieve a mixed solution density that is approximately (e.g., within 1-10 percent) that of a set or programmed density of salt water, sea water or ocean water, freshwater, brackish water, generally, or that of a measured density of the environmental water or the water at the location for distribution. It should be appreciated that the mixers <b>100</b>, <b>102</b> may be designed to mix any of a variety of components together (e.g., the environmental water, freshwater, other fluid, nutrients, organisms, materials, media) to facilitate distribution, as described herein.</p>
<p id="p-0047" num="0046">The controller <b>80</b> may control the activation of mixing features by turning on mixing features, e.g., by activating a paddle, activating a pump to create turbulence to enhance mixing, or by agitating or turning the mixers <b>100</b>, <b>102</b>, by way of example. The controller <b>80</b> may also select mixing settings depending on the contents of the mixers <b>100</b>, <b>102</b>. For example, nutrients may tolerate higher mixing intensity than organisms.</p>
<p id="p-0048" num="0047">In certain cases, one or more components of the distribution system may be incorporated into pre-existing aquatic vessel structures or systems, such as the bilge system or other water or fluid transfer systems. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref> is a schematic diagram of an embodiment of a ballast tank bioreactor <b>120</b>.

The ballast tank bioreactor <b>120</b> includes a light source <b>122</b>, such as a white light source or a white or visible light source, a power source <b>124</b>, and a growth or condition sensor <b>126</b>. Air is fed to an interior space <b>127</b> of the ballast tank bioreactor <b>120</b> via an air inlet <b>128</b>.

It should be understood that the distribution system <b>50</b> as provided herein may be a nutrient-only, bioreactor-only, or combined system as in the illustrated embodiment. Further, the distribution system <b>50</b> may include mixing components as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref>. The controller <b>80</b> can be programmed to identify or receive inputs as to the arrangement of components. As illustrated, the ballast bioreactor <b>120</b> may be arranged such that the air inlet <b>128</b> is positioned above the water line while the at least one environmental water input <b>72</b>, or dedicated ballast input <b>130</b> and/or nutrient container input (not shown), is below the water line. The at least one output <b>70</b>, such as the ballast output <b>132</b> and/or the nutrient output <b>112</b> (not shown) can be positioned to be at or near (e.g., above and/or below) an estimated water line location on the vessel <b>52</b>. For larger aquatic vessels, one or more components of the distribution system <b>50</b> may be located in an interior space <b>150</b>. Smaller or near-shore vessels, as illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b></figref>, may be arranged with bioreactors <b>60</b>, such as ballast bioreactors <b>120</b>, and nutrient containers <b>62</b> arranged on a vessel deck <b>160</b>. The at least one output <b>70</b>, such as the ballast output <b>132</b> or the nutrient output <b>112</b> are similarly arranged to be at or near (e.g., above and/or below) a water line of the vessel <b>52</b> while the at least one environmental water input <b>72</b> or dedicated ballast input <b>130</b> and/or any nutrient container input is below the water line.</p>
<p id="p-0050" num="0049">In an embodiment, the bioreactor <b>60</b> may be implemented as a multifunctional marine container that vessel operators may use to hold marine catch. However, when not being used to store marine catch, these marine containers may alternatively be used for organism growth. Thus, a marine container may be implemented to include bioreactor features such as an inlet for environmental water, an air source, nutrient source, and light source (e.g., a housing that permits white light through transmittal or a separate light source).</p>
<p id="p-0051" num="0050">Additionally or alternatively, the disclosed techniques may be used to distribute organisms grown off-vessel (e.g., grown using bioreactors <b>60</b> housed on land or housed on dedicated organism growing vessels), but distributed by the disclosed vessels <b>52</b>. For example, for certain nearshore marine settings, smaller vessels (such as shrimp boats) may not be configured or have sufficient hold or deck space to incorporate bioreactors <b>60</b>. These vessels <b>52</b> may include one or more nutrient containers <b>62</b> (which may be part of a mixing system <b>92</b>, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref>). If these vessels <b>52</b> are also used to distribute organisms (e.g., microalgae/phytoplankton), organism cultivation may be off-vessel, such as at a separate facility. In one example, the organisms may be grown in a nearby onshore facility and then the vessel <b>52</b> would transport the organisms to the desired location. In other vessels, the bioreactors <b>60</b> may be on-board, but instead or in addition to being configured as ballast tanks, the bioreactors <b>60</b> may be marine holding tanks that can be for shrimp, crabs, or specific marine organisms.</p>
<p id="p-0052" num="0051">Additionally or alternatively, the distribution system <b>50</b> may be used in conjunction with fixed structures, such as floating docks, ocean platforms, well-heads, pipelines, fixed cables, etc. In certain embodiments, the system <b>50</b> may be implemented as a fixed or floating system not associated with any vessel <b>52</b>. The fixed or floating system <b>50</b> may be serviced by vessels that refill nutrients containers <b>62</b> (e.g., based on sensor readings of nutrient levels). The system <b>50</b> may communicate with a central system, e.g., to transmit location information, identification information, status updates, and/or to permit service and maintenance. Such systems <b>50</b> may use solar, wind, or battery power as a power source to power distribution operations. When present, the bioreactor <b>60</b> may be implemented as a translucent tank to permit ambient light entry and/or may include a separate light source.</p>
<p id="p-0053" num="0052">As provided herein, the bioreactor <b>60</b> may be seeded with a culture of a desired organism. The seeded organism should be sufficient concentration for desired exponential growth, e.g., during transport or during an operation cycle of the system <b>50</b>. The seeded organism is permitted to proliferate to a bloom, which can be sensed using sensors <b>82</b> associated with (e.g., positioned in) the bioreactor <b>60</b>. Once a bloom or sufficient exponential growth is achieved, the organism can be distributed. However, in an embodiment, enough organisms can be maintained in the bioreactor <b>60</b>, even after distribution, to initiate a next cycle of growth to bloom and, in embodiments, to outcompete organisms present in the environmental water supply. In an embodiment, the environmental water is taken in to feed the next cycle of growth. Thus, the controller <b>80</b> can stop distribution before the bioreactor <b>60</b> is empty to maintain a seed for a subsequent growth cycle in an embodiment. In embodiments, each bioreactor <b>60</b> can facilitate multiple growth and distribution cycles while in operation and/or during vessel operation over a particular route. Starting with sufficient seed concentration at initial and/or subsequent cycles permits the desired organism to exponentially outgrow any organisms in the environmental water input.</p>
<p id="p-0054" num="0053">The system <b>50</b> may, in certain embodiments, include a supply set of bioreactors <b>60</b> that are dedicated to growth of a particular organism or organisms. The supply set may be land-based or housed in a supply vessel that services vessels <b>52</b>.</p>

<p id="p-0056" num="0055">In an embodiment, the at least one output <b>70</b> may include output conduits <b>202</b> and dispersal enhancement conduits <b>210</b>.

The dispersal enhancement conduit <b>210</b> may be at water level or below water level to create areas of local turbulence to enhance dispersal.</p>
<p id="p-0057" num="0056">Dispersal techniques represent the movement, spread and/or transport of plankton nutrients, media, and/or other materials introduced into aquatic environments (e.g., coastal marine, nearshore marine, open ocean, deep ocean and/or lakes, ponds, rivers, streams, bays, wetlands and estuaries) following dispersal vectors such as abiotic vectors (e.g., ocean currents, wind, waves). Dispersal patterns of plankton, nutrients, media, and/or materials and/or media are determined by the dispersal mechanism (gravity, wind, ballistic, water, and by animals), which in turn impacts genetic and/or demographic structure of plankton communities including but not limited to species interactions and migration patterns.</p>
<p id="p-0058" num="0057">In an embodiment, dispersal patterns may utilize ocean current dynamics and/or movement, as defined by variations in water density. This embodiment can also utilize the selection of locations based on the detected presence of underlying water masses and location within a major and/or minor oceanographic basin in order for the desired effect (or effects) that may include, but are not limited to, decreased aquatic hypoxia, increased aquatic oxygenation, or increased export of materials to depth, enhance fisheries. The desired end goals may be used to control selection of the distributed materials from the distribution system <b>50</b>. In an embodiment, dispersal patterns via wind incorporate local and/or global wind patterns. Locations for distribution may be chosen based on preferred wind patterns, currents, and/or upwelling and/or downwelling conditions, enabling introduced nutrients and/or plankton to move into the region and/or regions or areas that provide the desired effect (or effects) that may include but are not limited to decreased aquatic hypoxia, increased aquatic oxygenation, and increased export of materials to depth, enhance fisheries. In an embodiment, dispersal patterns of nutrients and/or plankton via a ballistic approach involves the release of plankton and/or nutrients in areas and/or regions in which the water column is stratified and/or movement of water is negligible, indicating an external force is determined to enhance distribution of the desired particles and/or plankton that provide the desired effect (or effects). In an embodiment, dispersal patterns of nutrients and/or plankton via water movement or animal activity result in transportation of the nutrients and/or plankton to the desired location so that the desired effect (or effects) are achieved. For example, animal activity may be associated with migration and/or the consumption and release from fecal matter. The presence of desired plankton and/or nutrients at one location may change as a result of animal activity.</p>

<p id="p-0067" num="0066">In certain embodiments, the system <b>50</b> may determine that environmental conditions are acceptable before activating distribution. For example, the system <b>50</b> may require that at least two of the following conditions are true to activate distribution: wind speed below 20 knots, wave height of less than 1.5 meters, surface current of less than 2 knots. Additionally or alternatively, the system <b>50</b> may activate distribution based on a time of day to disperse during the day or right at sunrise or just before sunrise to maximize growth and available light. In an embodiment, the system <b>50</b> may distribute based on sensor readings of sufficient ambient light and lack of cloud cover.</p>

<p id="p-0069" num="0068"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>11</b></figref> is a schematic illustration of an embodiment of the distribution system <b>50</b> implemented in conjunction with an aerial vehicle, such as an unmanned aerial vehicle <b>400</b> (e.g., a drone). A fleet of unmanned aerial vehicles, each in communication with the controller <b>80</b>, may be used to distribute materials. Other contemplated aerial vehicles include passenger planes, cargo planes, and helicopters. It should be appreciated that the vessel <b>52</b>, a fleet of aquatic vessels, the unmanned aerial vehicle <b>400</b>, the fleet of unmanned aerial vehicles, the other aerial vehicles, or any combination thereof may be utilized as part of the distribution system <b>50</b>. For example, the controller <b>80</b> may coordinate operation of the multiple vehicles (e.g., aquatic vessels, umanned aerial vehicles, other aerial vehicles) and distribution of the materials from the multiple vehicles. Further, the vehicles may be autonomously controlled vehicles (e.g., according to preprogrammed paths), remotely controlled vehicles (e.g., via a remotely-located controller operated by a human operator), and/or operator controlled vehicles (e.g., driven by a human operator on-board the vehicle). In this way, the distribution system <b>50</b> may be a network of vehicles that are controlled in a coordinated manner to effectively and/or efficiently distribute the materials. In some cases, the unmanned aerial vehicle <b>400</b> or the other aerial vehicles may have any of the components shown and described as being present on the vessel <b>52</b>, such as the one or more bioreactors <b>60</b>, the one or more nutrient containers <b>62</b>, the mixers <b>100</b>, <b>102</b>, and so forth. Additionally or alternatively, the unmanned aerial vehicle <b>400</b> and/or the other aerial vehicles may collect the materials from the vessel <b>52</b> (e.g., grown, stored, and/or mixed on the vessel <b>52</b>), store the materials on-board via a storage tank, and then travel and distribute the materials according to instructions received from the controller <b>80</b>, for example.</p>
<p id="p-0070" num="0069"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>12</b></figref> is a block diagram of the controller <b>80</b> of the distribution system <b>50</b> and associated communication pathways. As will be appreciated, in certain embodiments, the controller <b>80</b> may include at least one processor <b>500</b>, memory <b>502</b>, or any of a variety of other components, such as input/output interface <b>506</b>, and a display <b>508</b> that enable the controller <b>80</b> to carry out the techniques described herein. In addition, in certain embodiments, the controller <b>80</b> may include communication circuitry <b>510</b> to facilitate communication with other control systems of the vessel <b>52</b>, with a remote server <b>520</b>, or with other members of the vessel fleet <b>522</b>. In certain embodiments, the communication circuitry <b>510</b> may be configured to facilitate wireless communication and/or wired communication.</p>
<p id="p-0071" num="0070">The processor <b>500</b> may be any suitable type of computer processor or microprocessor capable of executing computer-executable code. In certain embodiments, the processor <b>500</b> may also include multiple processors that may perform the operations described herein, and certain operations may be distributed between the processor <b>500</b> and one or more remote servers <b>520</b>. The memory <b>502</b> may be any suitable articles of manufacture that can serve as media to store processor-executable code, data, or the like. These articles of manufacture may represent computer-readable media (e.g., any suitable form of memory or storage) that may store the processor-executable code used by the processor <b>500</b> to perform the presently disclosed techniques. The memory <b>502</b> may also be used to store data, various other software applications, and the like. The memory <b>502</b> may represent non-transitory computer-readable media (e.g., any suitable form of memory or storage) that may store the processor-executable code used by the processor <b>500</b> to perform various techniques described herein.</p>
<p id="p-0072" num="0071">In one example, the controller <b>80</b> may control or generate instructions to control a route of the aquatic vessel <b>52</b> and/or other distribution vehicle (e.g., airplane, unmanned aerial vehicle). For example, based on sensor data of current or wind speeds, the controller <b>80</b> may steer the vessel <b>52</b> to maximize a spread of distribution on or in the water. In a specific embodiment, the controller <b>80</b> may generate instructions to steer the vessel <b>52</b> towards lower wind locations relative to locations with higher wind speed. Further, the controller <b>80</b> may be capable of altering or modifying a preplanned travel route of the vessel <b>52</b> to promote more efficient distribution of materials while the distribution system <b>50</b> is actively distributing materials and/or to control movement of the vessel <b>52</b> to desired distribution locations.</p>
<p id="p-0073" num="0072">In one embodiment, the controller <b>80</b> may use estimated fuel expenditures as an input to route or distribution planning. For example, modifications to shipping routes for improved distribution may be permitted so long as (e.g., only if) vessel fuel expenditures associated with the change are estimated to increase no more than a certain percentage, such as 1 percent, relative to the unmodified route by way of example.</p>
<p id="p-0074" num="0073">The controller <b>80</b> may use machine learning and/or artificial intelligence and/or deep learning to model aquatic conditions and/or generate control algorithms for distribution of materials.</p>
<p id="p-0075" num="0074">The disclosed environmental treatment distribution system may be used to promote desired environmental treatment effects, such as decreased aquatic hypoxia, increased aquatic oxygenation, increased export of materials to depth, enhance fisheries. The desired effects may be created as part of distribution to surface waters of aquatic environments from maritime operating vessels and/or aircraft such as planes and/or helicopters in conjunction with other materials and/or nutrients enhancing growth and survivability.</p>
