<p id="p-0001" num="0000">Described herein are inserts for reducing sloshing in a bottle. The insert may be integrally formed in an outer shell of the bottle or removably insertable into the outer shell. The insert may include an elongate body extending between a first end opposite a second end; and an aperture defined by the elongate body and extending longitudinally through the elongate body between the first and second ends. The elongate body has an uncompressed state when removed from an outer shell and a compressed state when positioned in the outer shell. A diameter of the elongate body in the compressed state is less than or equal to a smallest diameter of the liquid retention compartment. The insert has a durometer between about 40 A and about 70 A. A volume of the insert is less than about 10% of a volume defined by the outer shell. The insert includes a compressible mesh material.</p>

<p id="p-0003" num="0002">All publications and patent applications mentioned in this specification are herein incorporated by reference in their entirety, as if each individual publication or patent application was specifically and individually indicated to be incorporated by reference in its entirety.</p>
<heading level="1" id="h-0003">TECHNICAL FIELD</heading>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">This disclosure relates generally to the field of liquid transport and anti-slosh devices, and more specifically to the field of anti-sloshing water bottles configured for use with athletic equipment or for tethering to a user. Described herein are anti-sloshing liquid-retaining bottles.</p>
<heading level="1" id="h-0004">BACKGROUND</heading>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">Elite-level athletes are constantly searching for ways to remove inefficiencies from their equipment, often by using the lightest components possible. One often overlooked inefficiency is the liquid and air mixture sloshing inside an athlete&#x2019;s water bottle. Because the water bottles are often mounted onto the user or their equipment, the sloshing caused by any activity or movement can have noticeable effects on the user and the handling of the equipment.</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">For example, cyclists&#x2019; carry water bottles on their bicycle frames. The sloshing caused by pedaling, road forces, and turning can have a noticeable effect on the handling, and therefore the overall efficiency and performance, of the bicycle.</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">Further, for example, runners&#x2019; carry water bottles on their body (e.g., their back, hips, in their hands, etc.). The sloshing caused by their legs and arms pumping and the pounding of the pavement can have a noticeable effect on the runner&#x2019;s efficiency and overall time.</p>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">Thus, there exists a need for new and useful anti-sloshing liquid bottles. Such new and useful anti-sloshing bottles are herein described.</p>

<heading level="1" id="h-0007">DETAILED DESCRIPTION</heading>
<p id="p-0081" num="0080">The foregoing is a summary, and thus, necessarily limited in detail. The above-mentioned aspects, as well as other aspects, features, and advantages of the present technology will now be described in connection with various embodiments. The inclusion of the following embodiments is not intended to limit the disclosure to these embodiments, but rather to enable any person skilled in the art to make and use the contemplated invention(s). Other embodiments may be utilized, and modifications may be made without departing from the spirit or scope of the subject matter presented herein. Aspects of the disclosure, as described and illustrated herein, can be arranged, combined, modified, and designed in a variety of different formulations, all of which are explicitly contemplated and form part of this disclosure.</p>
<p id="p-0082" num="0081">Described herein are liquid bottles or containers that employ an internal anti-sloshing mechanism. In some embodiments, the anti-sloshing mechanism is configured to reduce or prevent wave propagation of a liquid in an outer shell. The outer shell may include a valve connected to a mouthpiece of the bottle to control the flow of liquid out of the bottle.</p>
<p id="p-0083" num="0082">Described herein are liquid bottles or containers that employ an internal anti-sloshing mechanism. In some embodiments, the anti-sloshing mechanism is configured to apply compression forces against a non-carbonated liquid and an outer shell with a valve connected to a mouthpiece of the bottle to control the flow of liquid out of the bottle. For example, a pressure in a bladder in the bottle will allow a user to expel all air from the bottle before closing the valve. Once the air is eliminated from the bottle, the liquid can no longer slosh back and forth, resulting in increased efficiency for the user, for example a cyclist. When the user needs water, they open the valve, allowing water to automatically flow out of the pressurized bladder.</p>
<p id="p-0084" num="0083">In some embodiments, the anti-sloshing mechanism is configured to break up waves in the liquid, so they cannot propagate, thus reducing the amount of sloshing that can be felt by the user.</p>
<p id="p-0085" num="0084">In some embodiments, the anti-sloshing mechanism is configured to reversibly restrict an inflatable bladder using a series of springs, for example a constant force spring or leaf springs. Such restriction is configured to eliminate air from the bottle, thereby reducing liquid movement in the bottle.</p>
<p id="p-0086" num="0085">As used herein, a user refers to a cyclist, athlete, runner, backpacker, outdoorsman, or any other individual that could benefit from restricting liquid movement in a container or bottle that they are carrying or transporting.</p>
<p id="p-0087" num="0086">As used herein, a liquid includes, but is not limited to, water, sports drink, electrolyte solution, juice, tea, coffee, or any other beverage or solution that needs to be transported.</p>
<p id="p-0088" num="0087">As used herein, any liquid retaining member (e.g., outer shell, bladder, liquid retention compartment, insert, etc.) may be resusable or disposable.</p>
<p id="p-0089" num="0088">Turning now to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>1</b>-<b>3</b></figref>. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>1</b>-<b>3</b></figref> illustrate one embodiment of an anti-sloshing liquid-retaining bottle <b>100</b> with a passive anti-sloshing mechanism. A passive anti-sloshing liquid-retaining bottle <b>100</b> includes lid <b>46</b>, outer shell <b>44</b>, one or more wave breakers <b>48</b>, and mouthpiece <b>47</b>. The one or more wave breakers <b>48</b> includes one or more or a plurality of apertures <b>45</b> so that when a liquid contained in outer shell <b>44</b> sloshes, the liquid passes through the apertures <b>45</b> of the one or more wave breakers <b>48</b> which are configured to disrupt the movement of the liquid. For example, as the liquid contacts the one or more wave breakers <b>48</b>, the liquid trickles through the apertures <b>45</b> resulting in reduced sloshing and liquid movement. In some embodiments, the one or more wave breakers <b>48</b> include, additionally or alternatively, one or more grooves, indentations, cutouts, or the like that also act to disrupt movement of the liquid and reduce sloshing. For example, liquid entering the one or more grooves, indentations, or cutouts may swirl therein resulting in less energy and ultimately less sloshing.</p>
<p id="p-0090" num="0089">The one or more wave breakers <b>48</b> may be reversibly couplable (e.g., via a snap fit connection, screw connection, etc.) to lid <b>46</b> or outer shell <b>44</b>. In such embodiments, a number of wave breakers <b>48</b> may be optimized for a volume of liquid retained in the outer shell <b>44</b>, for example more wave breakers <b>48</b> being used for less liquid (e.g., <b>2</b>, <b>4</b>. <b>6</b>, <b>8</b>, <b>10</b>, <b>12</b>, <b>14</b>, <b>16</b>, <b>18</b>, <b>20</b> or more etc.). In other embodiments, the one or more wave breakers <b>48</b> and lid <b>46</b> or the one or more wave breakers <b>48</b> and outer shell <b>44</b> are a monolithic piece (i.e., one integrated component). Further, each wave breaker <b>48</b> may be of monolithic construction. Alternatively, each wave breaker <b>48</b> may include several sections coupled together to customize a length. For example, each section may be snapped into (e.g., each section includes a male peg end and a female port end), screwed into (e.g., each section includes a male helical screw end and a female threaded port), or otherwise attached to an adjacent section.</p>
<p id="p-0091" num="0090">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>2</b>-<b>3</b></figref>, lid <b>46</b> couples to outer shell <b>44</b>. For example, lid <b>46</b> is uncoupled from outer shell <b>44</b> to allow filling of outer shell <b>44</b> with a liquid. In such embodiments, outer shell <b>44</b> functions as a liquid-retaining compartment. Lid <b>46</b> is then coupled to outer shell <b>44</b> to retain the liquid therein. Lid <b>46</b> reversibly couples to outer shell <b>44</b> via one or more of a hinge mechanism, snap fit connection, screw and thread connection, or the like. In other embodiments, outer shell <b>44</b> is filled with liquid through a port, such that lid <b>46</b> is irreversibly coupled to outer shell <b>44</b>. For example, mouthpiece <b>47</b> may be removable to allow filling of outer shell <b>44</b> with liquid.</p>
<p id="p-0092" num="0091"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>4</b>-<b>20</b></figref> illustrate various embodiments of anti-sloshing liquid-retaining bottles with active anti-sloshing mechanisms. The embodiments shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>4</b>-<b>20</b></figref> use pressure, springs, or other active mechanisms to expand or restrict a bladder to reduce sloshing of a liquid in the bottle.</p>
<p id="p-0093" num="0092">Turning now to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>4</b>-<b>11</b></figref>. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>4</b>-<b>11</b></figref> illustrate various embodiments of anti-sloshing liquid-retaining bottles that use pressure to actively expand or contract a bladder.

<p id="p-0095" num="0094"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b></figref> illustrates a front view of an embodiment of an anti-sloshing liquid-retaining bottle <b>200</b> with a pressure mechanism for preventing sloshing. The anti-sloshing liquid-retaining bottle <b>200</b> comprises a mouthpiece <b>23</b> configured to expel a non-carbonated liquid through mouthpiece <b>23</b>. Anti-sloshing liquid-retaining bottle <b>200</b> comprises a lid <b>20</b>, outer shell <b>22</b>, a base comprising a high-pressure reservoir <b>26</b>, and a depressible purge button <b>28</b> configured to open a release valve.

<p id="p-0096" num="0095"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b></figref> illustrates a cross-sectional view of a pneumatic anti-sloshing liquid-retaining bottle <b>200</b> with the air retention compartment <b>27</b> in the high-pressure reservoir <b>26</b> in a non-pressurized or inactive state. The anti-sloshing liquid-retaining bottle <b>200</b> comprises a bladder <b>24</b> and internal components including pressure regulator assembly <b>36</b>, depressible purge button for activating a purge or release valve <b>28</b>, air retention compartment <b>27</b>, Schrader or fill or presta valve <b>34</b> for pressurizing the air retention compartment <b>27</b> in the high-pressure reservoir <b>26</b>, and pressure plate <b>32</b>. The bladder <b>24</b> is fluidically coupled such that air from the high-pressure reservoir can be released by the regulator in the pressure regulator assembly <b>36</b> into a reduced pressure compartment <b>21</b> that is fluidically coupled to the bladder <b>24</b> allowing the bladder to expand against any liquid retained in the liquid retention compartment <b>25</b> of the bottle.</p>
<p id="p-0097" num="0096">In various embodiments, a pneumatic anti-sloshing liquid-retaining bottle <b>200</b> can be filled by removing the lid <b>20</b> or the mouthpiece <b>23</b> from the outer shell <b>22</b> of the liquid-retaining bottle <b>200</b>, for example when air retention compartment <b>27</b> in the high-pressure reservoir <b>26</b> is in a non-pressurized or inactive state and/or when the bladder <b>24</b> is collapsed, as illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b></figref>. The lid <b>20</b>, mouthpiece <b>23</b>, or other reversibly coupled component of the bottle may be removed (e.g. via one or more of a hinge mechanism, snap fit connection, screw and thread connection, etc.) from the outer shell <b>22</b>, revealing an opening into the liquid retention compartment <b>25</b>, formed by the outer shell <b>22</b> and the bladder <b>24</b>. Filling of the liquid retention compartment <b>25</b> of the bottle may be done through the opening of the outer shell <b>22</b> after the lid <b>20</b>, mouthpiece <b>23</b>, or other reversibly coupled component of the bottle is removed for filling. After filling, the lid <b>20</b>, mouthpiece <b>23</b>, and/or other reversibly coupled component is replaced and coupled to the outer shell <b>22</b>. In this filled state, the 10-24 oz. of supplied liquid (e.g., non-carbonated or carbonated liquid) is contained in an enclosed liquid retention compartment <b>25</b> formed by the lid <b>20</b>, mouthpiece <b>23</b>, outer shell <b>22</b>, and bladder <b>24</b> of the anti-sloshing liquid-retaining bottle.</p>
<p id="p-0098" num="0097">A filled pneumatic anti-sloshing liquid-retaining bottle <b>200</b> in an inactive or unpressurized state as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b></figref>, can be activated for use by pressurizing the air retention compartment <b>27</b> housed within the high-pressure reservoir <b>26</b> before the bottle is filled with liquid, or before liquid is consumed from the bottle. Pressurization of the air retention compartment <b>27</b> is done by pumping air through a fill or Schrader or presta valve <b>34</b>. The high-pressure reservoir <b>26</b> and the pressure plate <b>32</b> are configured to retain their shape under higher pressures (e.g. pressure in the range of 20-300 psi) against their surfaces. For example, the high-pressure reservoir <b>26</b> and/or the pressure plate <b>32</b> may include or be formed of aluminum, stainless steel, carbon fiber or other composites or like materials to retain its shape under pressure. Further, a thickness of a wall of the high-pressure reservoir <b>26</b> and/or pressure plate may be anywhere from 0.01 to 0.25 inches, 0.1 to 0.2 inches, 0.05 to 0.1 inches, 0.05 to 0.25 inches, 0.2 to 0.25 inches, etc. to retain its shape under pressure.</p>
<p id="p-0099" num="0098">Air is forcefully pumped into the high-pressure reservoir <b>26</b> until the molecules of gas in the air are compressed enough to generate a pressure range of 20-300 psi. The increased pressure in the high-pressure reservoir generates a pressure differential across the pressure plate <b>32</b> and between the air retention compartment <b>27</b> and the reduced pressure compartment <b>21</b> that is fluidically coupled to bladder <b>24</b>. This pressure differential is detected by the pressure regulator assembly <b>36</b> of the regulator, which is configured to regulate the pressure of the high-pressure reservoir down by a factor of 2-100 (e.g., 2, 5, 10, 15, 20, 25, 40, 45, 50, 60) to a low-pressure range of less than or equal to 20 psi (e.g., 1-5 psi, 2-5 psi, 2-8 psi, 2-10 psi, 15-20 psi, etc.). The bladder <b>24</b> is fluidically coupled to the reduced pressure compartment <b>21</b> on the lower pressure side of the pressure plate <b>32</b>. A pressure in the reduced pressure compartment <b>21</b> may be 2-5 psi, 2-8 psi, 2-10 psi, 15-20 psi, etc. As the pressurized air is released into the reduced pressure compartment <b>21</b> from the air retention compartment <b>27</b> by the regulator in the pressure regulator assembly <b>36</b>, the air molecules flow into the fluidically coupled region comprising the reduced pressure compartment <b>21</b> and the cavity of the bladder <b>24</b> causing the bladder <b>24</b> to expand. The bladder <b>24</b> is includes or is formed of a expandable material (e.g., silicon, silicone-based materials, elastic polymers, etc.) with a modulus configured to expand in response to changes in the air pressure of bladder <b>24</b> as well as retain a hydrostatic pressure or force against the liquid stored in the liquid retention compartment <b>25</b> and the walls of the outer shell <b>22</b>, the lid <b>20</b>, and the mouthpiece <b>23</b>. The hydrostatic pressure or force prevents the liquid retained in the bottle from sloshing around. The pressurization of the compartment formed by the bladder <b>24</b> and the reduced pressure compartment <b>21</b> is generated and maintained by the high pressure of the air retention compartment <b>27</b> on the other side of the pressure plate <b>32</b>, that has been regulated down by the regulator in the pressure regulator assembly <b>36</b> to a reduced pressure range of less than or equal to 60 psi. The low-pressure range is sufficient to inflate the bladder <b>24</b> and apply force to the exposed area (or pressure) to the surface of the liquid in the liquid retention compartment <b>25</b>. A liquid that is incompressible or nearly incompressible stored within the bottle would retain or substantially retain a fixed volume under standard conditions (e.g., 32&#xb0; F.- 120&#xb0; F. environmental temperature; atmospheric pressure (at anywhere from sea level to high mountains ~20,000 ft). Therefore, pressure applied by the inflation of the bladder <b>24</b> on the incompressible or substantially incompressible liquid against the fixed dimensions of the outer shell <b>22</b>, the lid <b>20</b>, the mouthpiece <b>23</b>, and the expanding bladder <b>24</b>, would eliminate the existence of air or space for the liquid to slosh around when liquid flow out of the mouthpiece <b>23</b> is constricted or stopped (e.g., via a bite valve, nipple valve, stop cock, etc.). When the mouthpiece <b>23</b> is open (e.g., via bite valve, nipple valve, stop cock, etc.), the liquid would be expelled from the liquid retention compartment <b>25</b> at a rate dependent on the rate at which the bladder <b>24</b> continuously expands; more specifically, at a rate that is determined by the low-pressure range established by the regulator in the regulator assembly, for example less than or equal to 60 psi (e.g., 2-5 psi, 2-8 psi, 2-10 psi, 15-20 psi, etc.). The pneumatic mechanism disclosed in this example provides both a convenient means of expelling the liquid from the bottle when the mouthpiece <b>23</b> is open, while also ensuring that the liquid is continuously retained between the bladder <b>24</b>, the outer shell <b>22</b>, lid <b>20</b>, and mouthpiece <b>23</b> and thus unable to slosh around in the bottle.</p>
<p id="p-0100" num="0099"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>6</b></figref> illustrates a cross-sectional view of an embodiment of the pneumatic anti-sloshing liquid-retaining bottle <b>200</b> with the bladder <b>24</b> fully expanded. In this embodiment, most or all of the volume of liquid stored in the liquid retention compartment <b>25</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b></figref> has been expelled through the mouthpiece <b>23</b> by the expansion of the bladder <b>24</b>. The filling and emptying of the bottle <b>200</b> constitute one fill cycle. To refill the bottle after the first fill cycle, the purge button <b>28</b> is depressed activating a purge or release valve configured to vent the bladder into the atmosphere, such that the bladder <b>24</b> contracts back to an initial size (e.g., 0.2 cubic inches or less) of the bladder <b>24</b>, for example as illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b></figref>. Depression of the purge button <b>28</b> simultaneously blocks off the output of the regulator in the pressure regulator assembly <b>36</b>, thereby preventing the depressurization of the high-pressure reservoir <b>26</b> and retaining the high-pressure environment of the air retention compartment <b>27</b> while the bladder <b>24</b> is vented to the atmosphere (i.e., atmospheric pressure). In some embodiments the high-pressure reservoir <b>26</b> is configured to retain sufficient pressure in the high-pressure environment of the air retention compartment <b>27</b> to fill and use the bottle for additional fill cycles (e.g., a second, third, fourth, fifth, etc.) without requiring the high-pressure reservoir <b>26</b> to be reactivated or re-pressurized by pumping air forcefully (e.g., manual or automatic mechanism; using a bike tire pump, high pressure bike shock pump, suction valve, or the like designed for reaching high pressure (e.g., &gt;150 psi)) into the air retention compartment <b>27</b>. The bottle <b>200</b> with an activated or pressurized air retention compartment <b>27</b> can then be refilled with liquid, for example using the mechanism that was used to fill the bottle during the first fill cycle. More specifically, the lid <b>20</b>, mouthpiece <b>23</b>, or other reversibly coupled component of the bottle <b>200</b> can be removed (e.g. via one or more of a hinge mechanisms, snap fit connection, screw and thread connection, etc.) from outer shell <b>22</b> revealing an opening into liquid retention compartment <b>25</b>, formed, in part, by outer shell <b>22</b> and bladder <b>24</b>. The liquid retention compartment <b>25</b> of the bottle is configured to be filled with liquid through the opening of the outer shell for example through a mouthpiece <b>23</b> or other reversibly coupled component of the bottle that can be removed for filling and replaced. In the filled state, the supplied liquid is contained in an enclosed liquid retention compartment <b>25</b> formed by the lid <b>20</b>, mouthpiece <b>23</b>, outer shell <b>22</b>, and bladder <b>24</b> of the anti-sloshing liquid-retaining bottle <b>200</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0101" num="0100"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>7</b></figref> illustrates an exploded view of an embodiment of bottle <b>200</b> in the depressurized or inactive state illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b></figref>. In this exploded view, the mechanisms forming the reduced pressure compartment <b>25</b> on the low-pressure side of the pressure plate <b>32</b> and the high-pressure reservoir <b>26</b> on the other side of the pressure plate <b>32</b> are illustrated in greater detail. The lid <b>20</b>, bladder <b>24</b>, and outer shell <b>22</b> are shown in the upper part of the exploded view, together these components form the liquid retention compartment <b>25</b>, where the liquid is contained. Below this section of the device are the pressurized components of the liquid-retaining bottle. A pressure differential is formed across the pressure regulator assembly <b>36</b> and the pressure plate <b>32</b> that separate the reduced pressure compartment <b>21</b> and the air retention compartment <b>27</b>. The regulator of the pressure regulator assembly <b>36</b> reduces the high-pressure provided by the air retention compartment <b>27</b> that was created by pumping air through the Schrader or fill or presta valve <b>34</b> into the air retention compartment <b>27</b> of the high-pressure reservoir <b>26</b>. In this illustration, the purge seal <b>38</b> is visible below the pressure plate <b>32</b>. The purge seal <b>38</b> (shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>8</b>-<b>11</b></figref>) is responsible for sealing the air retention compartment <b>27</b> of the high-pressure reservoir <b>26</b> off from the low-pressure side of the pressure plate <b>32</b> when the depressible button <b>28</b> activates the purge or release valve. This mechanism for purging is configured to release the pressure of the bladder <b>24</b> by depressing the purge button <b>28</b> and opening the purge valve while engaging the purge seal <b>38</b> to enable the anti-sloshing liquid-retaining bottle <b>200</b> to be used for multiple fill cycles without pumping up or re-pressurizing the air retention compartment <b>27</b> of the high-pressure reservoir <b>26</b> between the fill cycles.</p>
<p id="p-0102" num="0101"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>8</b></figref> illustrates in greater detail an embodiment of the mechanisms forming the low-pressure side of the pressure plate <b>32</b> and the high-pressure reservoir <b>26</b>. In this configuration the purge button <b>28</b> is in the default position, with the air in the bladder closed off to the atmosphere while also leaving the regulator open to fill the bladder <b>24</b>. In this example, bottle <b>200</b> is illustrated in the pressurized or active state with the depressible button <b>28</b> configured for activating the purge or release valve <b>28</b> in the default state (e.g., protruding, or otherwise not activated, capable of being depressed, etc.). In this state, the purge seal <b>38</b> shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>7</b></figref> closes off the bladder <b>24</b> from the atmosphere (i.e., atmospheric pressure) thus creating a closed system between the regulator or the pressure regulator assembly <b>36</b> and the low-pressure side of the pressure plate <b>32</b>. In this configuration, the bladder <b>25</b> is pressurized at a pressure range that is 1 psi to 10 psi (e.g., less than or equal to 10 psi, 20 psi, 5 psi, 1-5 psi, 60 psi, 2-5 psi, 10-30 psi, etc.) determined by the regulator, wherein the high-pressure side of the plate is determined by the pressure pumped into the high-pressure side. In some embodiments, the regulator is a diaphragm pressure regulator. In further embodiments, the output of pressure released by the regulator is directed towards the purge button <b>28</b> for release when the purge button <b>28</b> is depressed.</p>

Activating the purge or release valve simultaneously engages the purge seal <b>40</b> to close against the output on the regulator of the pressure regulator assembly <b>36</b> preventing the air retention compartment <b>27</b> within the high pressure reservoir <b>26</b> from venting to the atmosphere (i.e., releasing the pressurized air held within the air retention compartment <b>27</b> to the atmosphere).</p>

As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>10</b></figref>, the purge button is in a default position that closes off the air in the bladder <b>25</b> to the atmosphere preventing the bladder <b>24</b> from purging while also leaving the regulator in the pressure regulator assembly <b>36</b> open and enabling the air from the air retention compartment <b>27</b> of the high pressure reservoir <b>26</b> to move through the regulator of the pressure regulatory assembly <b>36</b> allowing the filling of the bladder <b>24</b>. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>10</b></figref>, the purge button <b>28</b> for activating the purge or release valve is in a default or expressed position. In this illustration, the purge spring <b>42</b> keeps the purge button <b>40</b> in the default or expressed position. The regulator seal <b>30</b> is away from the regulator of the pressure regulator assembly <b>36</b> and the purge seal <b>40</b> attached to the purge button <b>28</b> is configured to allow the pressure regulator in the pressure regulator assembly <b>36</b> to flow in this state, thereby filling the bladder <b>24</b>.</p>

The purge button in the purge position opens the air in the bladder <b>25</b> to the atmosphere, thereby deflating the bladder and simultaneously closing off the output port of the regulator in the pressure regulator assembly <b>36</b>, so that the air retention compartment <b>27</b> in the high pressure reservoir <b>26</b> doesn&#x2019;t empty when purging the bladder <b>24</b>. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>11</b></figref>, the purge mechanism is in the purge position with the purge button <b>28</b> and purge spring <b>42</b> depressed. The purge seal <b>40</b>, in this configuration, permits air from the bladder <b>24</b> to vent to the atmosphere while simultaneously activating the regulator seal <b>30</b> by moving it and pushing it into the regulator output of the pressure regulator assembly <b>36</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0106" num="0105">Turning now to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>12</b>-<b>20</b></figref>. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>12</b>-<b>20</b></figref> illustrates various embodiments of an anti-sloshing liquid-retaining bottle that employs a spring-based anti-sloshing mechanism.</p>

In contrast to other embodiments described herein in which the outer shell retains a liquid in a liquid retaining compartment, the embodiment <b>300</b> shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>12</b>-<b>15</b></figref> uses a bladder within an outer shell to retain a liquid. As such, in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>12</b>-<b>15</b></figref> the bladder forms the liquid retaining compartment.</p>
<p id="p-0108" num="0107">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>12</b>-<b>15</b></figref>, bottle <b>300</b> includes lid <b>2</b>, outer shell <b>4</b>, mouthpiece <b>5</b>, bladder <b>6</b>, and spring mechanism (depressible plunger <b>12</b>, spring <b>8</b>, spring housing <b>10</b>, spring support <b>14</b>, first retention mechanism <b>16</b>, and second retention mechanism <b>18</b>).

The structure of the spring mechanism will now be described in greater detail with reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>13</b></figref>. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>13</b></figref>, spring <b>8</b> is movable or compressible within spring housing <b>10</b> between a compressed state, in which bladder <b>6</b> is filled with a liquid (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>14</b></figref>), and an uncompressed state, in which some, part of, a quantity (e.g., ounces) of, or all of a liquid has been expelled from bladder <b>6</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>15</b></figref>). Further, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>13</b></figref>, spring support <b>14</b> interacts with a proximal end <b>15</b> of spring <b>8</b> to maintain spring <b>8</b> substantially axially centered within spring housing <b>10</b>. A protruding member of spring support <b>14</b> inserts into a center region of spring <b>8</b> to maintain spring <b>8</b> substantially axially centered within spring housing <b>10</b>. Further, depressible plunger <b>12</b> is coupled to spring support <b>14</b> via retention mechanism <b>16</b>, for example a screw, glue, peg, etc. As such, manipulation of depressible plunger <b>12</b> manipulates a position of spring <b>8</b>. Retention mechanism <b>18</b>, for example screw, glue, peg, etc., couples spring housing <b>10</b> to outer shell <b>4</b>. Taken together, retention mechanism <b>18</b> maintains spring housing <b>10</b> in a substantially fixed position within outer shell <b>4</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0110" num="0109"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>14</b> and <b>15</b></figref> show bladder <b>6</b> in an expanded configuration with a compressed spring mechanism and bladder <b>6</b> in a compressed configuration with a decompressed spring mechanism, respectively. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>14</b></figref>, depressible plunger <b>12</b> compresses spring <b>8</b> to allow bladder <b>6</b> to expand. This expanded bladder configuration may also be referred to herein as a fill configuration, in which bladder <b>6</b> is full or substantially full of a liquid. Further, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>15</b></figref>, depressible plunger <b>12</b> decompresses spring <b>8</b> and acts on bladder <b>6</b> to compress bladder <b>6</b>, which compresses a liquid retained in bladder <b>6</b>. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>15</b></figref>, decompression of bladder <b>6</b> results in removal of air from bladder <b>6</b>, compresses a liquid in bladder <b>6</b>, and/or expels liquid from bladder <b>6</b> when mouthpiece <b>5</b> is open. The expansion (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>15</b></figref>) or contraction (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>14</b></figref>) of spring <b>8</b> is controlled by a position of depressible plunger <b>12</b>. Depressible plunger <b>12</b> moves proximally (moved towards lid <b>2</b>) as liquid is removed from the bladder, for example via a user drinking the liquid or liquid being expelled through a mouthpiece. As such, spring <b>8</b> applies a constant force onto bladder <b>6</b>, so that as liquid is removed from bladder <b>6</b>, a position of spring <b>8</b> is automatically adjusted to continually apply pressure to bladder <b>6</b>. For example, 5-50 lbs. of force is applied to bladder <b>6</b> by spring <b>8</b>. In some embodiments, the force applied to the bladder is 20 lbs, 25 lbs, 30 lbs, 35 lbs, 40 lbs, 20-40 lbs, 25-35 lbs, 30-35 lbs, 28-33 lbs, 29-31 lbs., 25-32 lbs., etc.</p>

In some embodiments, liquid retention compartment <b>57</b> is defined by lid <b>52</b>, outer shell <b>50</b>, and bladder <b>54</b> and/or spring housing <b>56</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0113" num="0112"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>17</b>-<b>20</b></figref> show various configurations of the spring mechanism, bladder <b>54</b>, and liquid retention compartment <b>57</b> contained within outer shell <b>50</b>. For example, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>17</b> and <b>19</b></figref> show spring mechanism and bladder <b>54</b> in an unexpanded configuration, and <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>18</b> and <b>20</b></figref> show spring mechanism and bladder <b>54</b> in an expanded configuration. The structure of the spring mechanism will now be described in further detail.</p>
<p id="p-0114" num="0113">Spring housing <b>56</b> is irreversibly or reversibly coupled to a distal end of outer shell <b>50</b> and maintains the spring mechanism substantially axially centered within outer shell <b>50</b>. Further, bladder <b>54</b> is disposed about or positioned substantially around spring housing <b>56</b>, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>17</b>-<b>18</b></figref>, so that extension of the leaf springs <b>60</b> expands bladder <b>54</b>. Alternatively or additionally, bladder <b>54</b> is coupled to an interior surface of outer shell <b>50</b>. The distal end of outer shell <b>50</b> forms a base or mount <b>58</b> of the spring mechanism. Each of the leaf springs are coupled to mount <b>58</b>, which extends up into spring housing <b>56</b>, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>19</b>-<b>20</b></figref>. Spring housing <b>56</b> further includes or defines one or more or a plurality of apertures or slots <b>59</b> through which a leaf spring <b>60</b> extends upon rotation of mount <b>58</b>. As mount <b>58</b> is rotated, one or more leaf springs <b>60</b> expand from mount <b>58</b> and extend through one or more apertures in spring housing <b>56</b> to thereby expand bladder <b>54</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0115" num="0114">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>18</b> and <b>20</b></figref>, expansion of one or more leaf springs <b>60</b> causes bladder <b>54</b> to also expand, which applies pressure to a liquid in liquid-retaining compartment <b>57</b>. In some embodiments, rotation of mount <b>58</b> causes a distal most leaf spring <b>61</b>, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>20</b></figref>, to expand first and then as mount <b>58</b> is further rotated, additional leaf springs <b>60</b> extend from mount <b>58</b>, moving proximally toward lid <b>52</b>, and through aperture <b>59</b> in spring housing <b>56</b>. As such, a bladder <b>54</b> disposed around or about spring housing <b>56</b> is expanded distally first, and then expansion of the bladder <b>54</b> continues in a proximal direction towards lid <b>52</b> until all or substantially all liquid is expelled from liquid-retaining compartment <b>57</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0116" num="0115">To reset the bottle back to a fillable configuration in which liquid is added to liquid-retention compartment <b>57</b>, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>17</b> and <b>19</b></figref>, spring mount <b>58</b> is rotated, in an opposite direction, so that leaf springs <b>60</b> retract and coil onto spring mount <b>58</b>. In turn, bladder <b>54</b> returns to an unexpanded configuration.</p>
<p id="p-0117" num="0116"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>21</b>-<b>23</b></figref> illustrate various embodiments of an anti-sloshing liquid-retaining bottle <b>70</b>. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>21</b>-<b>22</b></figref>, an anti-sloshing bottle <b>70</b> includes outer shell <b>74</b>, <b>102</b> and lid <b>101</b>, which together define a liquid retention compartment <b>78</b> configured for storing liquid therein. An insert <b>72</b>, <b>103</b> may be positioned in the liquid retention compartment <b>78</b> of the outer shell <b>74</b>. The insert <b>72</b> may be removable (i.e., can be taken out of and inserted into the outer shell), as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>22</b>-<b>23</b></figref>, or integrally formed in the liquid retention compartment <b>78</b> (i.e., not removable), such that the insert <b>72</b> is fixed in the liquid retention compartment <b>78</b>. For example, an outer surface <b>85</b> of the insert may be irreversibly attached to an inner sidewall or surface <b>87</b> of the outer shell <b>102</b>, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>22</b></figref>.
