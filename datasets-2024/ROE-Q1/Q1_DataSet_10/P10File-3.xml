<p id="p-0002" num="0001">This is a continuation of U.S. application Ser. No. 16/437,000, filed on Jun. 11, 2019, which was continuation-in-part application of U.S. application Ser. No. 16/194,305, filed on Nov. 17, 2018, and claims priority to U.S. application No. 62/721,002, filed on Aug. 22, 2018. The patent applications identified above are incorporated herein by reference in their entirety to provide continuity of disclosure.</p>
<?cross-reference-to-related-applications description="Cross Reference To Related Applications" end="tail"?>
<?summary-of-invention description="Summary of Invention" end="lead"?>
<heading id="h-0002" level="1">FIELD OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">This invention relates to animal crates and more particularly to an animal crate having a ventilation system with at least one active fan for circulating fresh air through the animal crate to prevent pets contained within the animal crate from overheating.</p>
<heading id="h-0003" level="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">Animal crates are commonly used to secure dogs and other animals during transport or while being left unsupervised. Animal crates may also be left open so a dog may freely enter or exit the crate to rest.</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">Unfortunately, overheating is a common problem when crating dogs. This is due the confined area within the crate combined with a lack of air movement. Overheating becomes even more of a problem when a crate is placed outdoors on a patio, in a cargo area of a vehicle or other space where heat is already an issue and/or air flow is at a minimum or nonexistent.</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">Some crates incorporate small fans in a backside of the crate, but such fans do not provide sufficient air flow to prevent a pet contained therein from overheating, particularly in a warm environment.</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">Therefore, a need exists for an animal crate having a ventilation system for circulating fresh air through the animal crate to prevent pets contained within the animal crate from overheating.</p>
<heading id="h-0004" level="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">The primary object of the present invention is to provide an animal crate having a ventilation system for circulating fresh air through the animal crate to prevent pets contained within the animal crate from overheating.</p>
<p id="p-0009" num="0008">The present invention fulfills the above and other objects by providing an animal crate having an inner surface, outer surface, front panel, rear panel, bottom panel, top panel, right side panel and left side panel. A door is located on the front panel and hingedly attached thereto. The door is preferably a wire mesh door to allow air to pass through. The crate uses intake fans mounted on either or both the top and rear panel of the crate, which pull air into a hollow chamber within the crate. The air will collect in the chamber while the intake fans continuously push air from the hollow chamber through apertures in a false ceiling of the crate. The top panel and side panels of the crate would preferably have angled holes to better distribute air flow within the crate while preventing an animal from accessing any moving parts within the fans.</p>
<p id="p-0010" num="0009">The at least one fan is preferably a rheostat fan or equivalent electric fan having a housing that contains at least one fan blade that covers the at least one active ventilation aperture the top panel and/or rear panel of the crate and forces air through the at least one active ventilation aperture and into the crate when activated by a power source.</p>
<p id="p-0011" num="0010">The fans may be activated and deactivated manually by an individual directly at the crate or remotely via a handheld remote or over the Internet using a smart phone or other computer device. Alternatively, the fan may be activated and deactivated by one or more sensors, such as a weight sensor, heat sensor, motion sensor, proximity sensor and so forth, that senses if a dog is present in the crate and and/or determines a temperature or heat signature within the crate has exceeded or fell below a predetermined level.</p>
<p id="p-0012" num="0011">Optionally, filters can be inserted between each fan and the crate to collect airborne pet hair and other debris.</p>
<p id="p-0013" num="0012">The above and other objects, features and advantages of the present invention should become even more readily apparent to those skilled in the art upon a reading of the following detailed description in conjunction with the drawings wherein there is shown and described illustrative embodiments of the invention.</p>
