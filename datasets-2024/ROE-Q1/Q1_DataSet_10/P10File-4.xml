<p id="p-0100" num="0099">A diagram illustrating an example of an operation flow of maintenance screen display processing, as illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>15</b>B</figref>, is described below with reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>11</b>B</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0101" num="0100">As illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>15</b>B</figref>, first, in a case where a user has input an instruction to display the maintenance screen <b>1110</b>, by using the terminal operating part <b>34</b> of the terminal apparatus <b>3</b>, the display processing unit <b>361</b> of the terminal apparatus <b>3</b> extracts the reel information stored in the terminal storage <b>33</b> (step S<b>501</b>). The instruction to display the maintenance screen <b>1110</b> is input, for example, in a case where the user has operated the terminal operating part <b>34</b> to provide an instruction to the maintenance display button <b>904</b> in the menu screen <b>900</b> displayed in the terminal display unit <b>35</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0102" num="0101">Then, the display processing unit <b>361</b> displays the maintenance screen <b>1110</b> including the extracted reel information, in the terminal display unit <b>35</b> (step S<b>502</b>), and terminates the maintenance screen display processing. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>11</b>B</figref> is a diagram illustrating an example of the maintenance screen <b>1110</b> displayed in the terminal apparatus <b>3</b>. The maintenance screen <b>1110</b> comprises, for example, a reel information display region <b>1111</b> and a return button <b>1112</b>. In the reel information display region <b>1111</b>, the extracted reel information is displayed. Note that in a case where the reel information does not include the function setting information, the function setting information may be displayed in the reel information display region <b>1111</b>. In a case where the user has operated the terminal operating part <b>34</b> to provide an instruction to the return button <b>1112</b>, the display processing unit <b>361</b> of the terminal apparatus <b>3</b> terminates a display of the maintenance screen <b>1110</b>, and displays the menu screen <b>900</b> in the terminal display unit <b>35</b>. Conventionally, the reel display unit <b>23</b> has a problem in which a display of the reel information has poor list performance. However, the terminal display unit <b>35</b> displays the maintenance screen <b>1110</b>, and therefore a user can view various pieces of information (a model name (a product name), date of an input of the line input information, or the like).</p>
<p id="p-0103" num="0102">In the maintenance screen <b>1110</b>, various types of display information may be displayed together with the reel information or instead of the reel information, and an example of the various types of display information is URL information for a transition to a home page screen for maintenance that can be downloaded from an external Web server apparatus. An example of processing for displaying various types of display information is described below. For example, in a case where a user has operated the terminal operating part <b>34</b> to provide an instruction relating to URL information (or a button or the like that is associated with the URL information), the terminal transmitter <b>362</b> transmits a service provision instruction to an external Web server apparatus by using the second terminal communication unit <b>32</b>. Next, the terminal receiver <b>363</b> receives display information for displaying a screen that has been transmitted from the Web server apparatus in response to the service provision instruction, by using the second terminal communication unit <b>32</b>. Then, the display processing unit <b>361</b> displays a screen based on the received display information, and the display processing is terminated. Note that the screen based on the received display information is a screen for displaying information relating to a product such as the fishing electric reel <b>2</b> or another fishing tackle, or the like, a screen for receiving various services including registration, such as an application for the purchase of the fishing electric reel <b>2</b> or another product, and/or the like. The screen based on the received display information may be any screen if the screen has been generated by a manufacturer, a seller, an agency, an affiliate program participant, or the like of the fishing electric reel <b>2</b> or another fishing tackle. As described above, conventionally, there has been a problem in which a user fails to perform a simple operation to obtain information relating to the fishing electric reel <b>2</b> or another product that the user possesses or receive various services. However, the maintenance screen <b>1110</b> displays various pieces of information, and therefore a user can obtain detailed information, or can receive various services including registration, such as application.</p>
<p id="p-0104" num="0103">As described above, in the reel information management system <b>1</b>, a user only operates the terminal apparatus <b>3</b>, and therefore the reel control program of the fishing electric reel <b>2</b> can be updated, and the reel information can be set. Therefore, the user can manage information relating to the fishing electric reel <b>2</b>, by only using the terminal apparatus <b>3</b> without going to a fishing tackle store or the like and asking for help of an expert.</p>
