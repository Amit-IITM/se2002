<?summary-of-invention description="Summary of Invention" end="lead"?>
<heading id="h-0001" level="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<heading id="h-0002" level="1">1. Field of the Invention</heading>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">The present invention relates to a receptacle for a laryngoscope, oral airway, endotracheal tube (ETT) and the like and a method of using the same. In particular, the invention relates to isolation of clean and contaminated laryngoscopes and other medical equipment and disposal of medical waste.</p>
<heading id="h-0003" level="1">2. Description of Related Art</heading>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">Cleanliness and even sterility is desired in many medical settings, such as, for example, patient examination rooms, operating rooms, hospital rooms, procedure rooms, emergency rooms and blood drawing facilities (&#x201c;labs&#x201d;). In particular, the sterility and cleanliness of medical devices as well as the cleanliness of the overall environment is required in operating rooms. Many procedures and protocols concerning sterility, cleanliness and maintenance are put into place in hospitals and outpatient facilities that have operating rooms.</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">Despite these procedures and protocols and the best efforts of the doctors, nurses and other staff members, cleanliness of a medical setting may be compromised when the care of the patient takes priority. For example, a doctor such as an anesthesiologist must simultaneously monitor a patient under anesthesia while properly handling medical devices such as a laryngoscope that come into contact with the patient or the patient's bodily fluids. In some instances, the doctor may sacrifice proper handling of such medical devices in favor of urgent patient care needs. Accordingly, the cleanliness and sterility of the operating room and/or medical devices used in the operating room may be compromised during improper handling of medical equipment and/or improper disposal of medical waste.</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">For many reasons, including, for example, inadequate training, poor personal habits, carelessness, the need for urgent patient care, or lack of proper equipment, unintended cross-contaminated medical equipment may be used on patients, the patient may be exposed to a contaminated environment, or staff and patients may be exposed to improperly disposed medical equipment. Such contamination and improper disposal and its significance oftentimes goes unnoticed or is ignored.</p>
<heading id="h-0004" level="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">What is needed is a system, receptacle and/or process that allows a doctor, nurse or other staff member to monitor a patient while simultaneously properly handling and discarding medical equipment without contaminating the surrounding environment. Additionally, what is also needed is a system, receptacle and/or process that enables a doctor, nurse or other staff member to properly handle clean and soiled medical equipment by making it easier to maintain isolation of a clean (or contaminated) portion of the medical equipment from other medical equipment and/or the environment. The present invention is believed to be an answer to the foregoing needs.</p>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">Bearing in mind the problems and deficiencies of the prior art, it is therefore an object of the present invention to provide an improved method, system and device to monitor a patient while simultaneously properly handling and discarding medical equipment without contaminating the surrounding environment.</p>
<p id="p-0009" num="0008">It is another object of the present invention to provide an improved method, system and device for maintaining cleanliness and sterility of the operating room and/or medical devices used in the operating room that might be compromised during improper handling of medical equipment and/or improper disposal of medical waste.</p>
<p id="p-0010" num="0009">A further object of the invention is to provide an improved method and system for using a laryngoscope during a medical procedure on a patient.</p>
<p id="p-0011" num="0010">Still other objects and advantages of the invention will in part be obvious and will in part be apparent from the specification.</p>
<p id="p-0012" num="0011">The above and other objects, which will be apparent to those skilled in the art, are achieved in the present invention which is directed in one aspect to a method of using a laryngoscope during a medical procedure on a patient comprising providing a laryngoscope handle, providing a blade for attaching to the handle and providing a receptacle for temporary storage of the laryngoscope blade. The receptacle has an exterior exposed to the environment around the patient and a normally open mouth leading to an interior area of the receptacle, the receptacle being disposed on a surface. The method includes attaching the blade to the handle to make the laryngoscope operable, inserting the laryngoscope blade into an oral cavity of the patient, and removing the blade from the oral cavity while maintaining a grip with one hand on the laryngoscope handle. The method further includes, while still maintaining the grip with the one hand on the laryngoscope handle, inserting the blade through the open mouth into the interior of the receptacle, without touching the laryngoscope with another hand and subsequently releasing the one hand from the laryngoscope handle so that the handle stays on the exterior of the receptacle while keeping the blade substantially within the interior of the receptacle. The laryngoscope blade may be stored during the medical procedure in a position isolated from contamination by or contaminating the handle, the surface and the environment around the patient.</p>
<p id="p-0013" num="0012">The method may further include, after inserting the blade into the receptacle, folding the handle toward the blade while the blade is pushed against the interior surface of the receptacle, during which the blade is prevented from coming in contact with the handle, the operator or the surface on which the receptacle is disposed.</p>
<p id="p-0014" num="0013">The method may also further include, after inserting the blade into the receptacle, and while still maintaining the grip with the one hand on the laryngoscope handle, folding the handle, toward the blade, against the exterior of the receptacle, without touching the handle against the blade and without touching the laryngoscope with another hand.</p>
<p id="p-0015" num="0014">The handle may be folded, toward the blade, against the exterior of the receptacle and the blade may rest against the interior of the receptacle, during storage in which the blade is isolated from the handle, operator or the surface.</p>
<p id="p-0016" num="0015">The handle may be folded toward the blade against the exterior of the receptacle without touching the handle against the surface on which the receptacle is disposed, and during storage the handle may be isolated from contamination by the surface. The blade may remain substantially within the interior of the receptacle during storage and the handle may remain substantially on the exterior of the receptacle during storage.</p>
<p id="p-0017" num="0016">The laryngoscope may be subsequently reusable during the medical procedure on the patient by unfolding the handle away from the blade and removing the blade from the receptacle.</p>
<p id="p-0018" num="0017">The receptacle may be disposed on a substantially horizontal surface within an arm's reach of an operator using the laryngoscope while standing or sitting near the patient. An adhesive may be provided to removably secure the receptacle on the surface. The receptacle may comprise a portion of an original packaging of the blade when new.</p>
<p id="p-0019" num="0018">The method may include inserting the blade into the receptacle with one hand without having the need to hold the receptacle with the other hand or otherwise requiring the use of the other hand in the insertion of the blade into the receptacle. The method may further include using the other hand to hold an endotracheal tube within a trachea of the patient while the one hand inserts the blade into the receptacle and folds the handle toward the blade. The method may further include separating the blade from the handle and disposing of the blade while in the receptacle.</p>
<p id="p-0020" num="0019">The receptacle may have a base for contact with the surface and an opposite, cover out of contact with the surface, and the base may be longer than the cover at the mouth of the receptacle to provide isolation of the laryngoscope from the surface on which the receptacle is disposed. The receptacle may have a base for contact with the surface and an opposite, cover out of contact with the surface, and the cover may be shorter than the base at the mouth of the receptacle to facilitate insertion of the blade into the interior of the receptacle and isolation of the blade. The receptacle may have a base and a cover over the base, the cover being wider than the base, and/or having folds or pleats in it.</p>
<p id="p-0021" num="0020">In a further aspect the invention is directed to a receptacle for receiving a medical device, the receptacle comprising: an elongate base; a cover, the cover and elongate base hingedly secured to one another; the cover and the elongate base cooperating to define an envelope having mouth extending into an interior area of the envelope; and a biasing member communicating with the cover and configured to bias the mouth in an open position for receiving at least a portion of the medical device through the mouth into the interior area.</p>
<p id="p-0022" num="0021">Another aspect of the present invention is directed to a method of isolating at least a portion of a medical device, the method comprising: positioning a receptacle according to any embodiment disclosed herein at a location easily accessible to medical personnel while the medical personnel monitors a patient; utilizing a medical device on the patient; and inserting at least a portion of the medical device utilized on the patient into the receptacle, thereby isolating at least a portion of the medical device.</p>
<p id="p-0023" num="0022">A further aspect of the present invention is directed to a method of manufacturing a receptacle for receiving a medical device, the method comprising: hingedly securing a cover to an elongate base, the cover and the elongate base cooperating to define an envelope having a mouth extending into an interior area of the envelope; and positioning a biasing member to communicate with the cover and to bias the mouth in an open position for receiving at least a portion of the medical device through the mouth into the interior area.</p>
<p id="p-0024" num="0023">These and other aspects of the invention are discussed in more detail herein and are illustrated in the attached Figures.</p>

If a contaminated medical device is inserted into the receptacle <b>10</b>, it is to prevent the contamination from spreading to the environment, people near the device, or other medical devices or equipment. It is contemplated that only a portion of the medical device <b>12</b> may be inserted into (i.e., received by) the receptacle <b>10</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0045" num="0044">A medical device <b>12</b> includes medical devices and any other solid material that has, or will, come into contact with a patient (not shown) or has come into contact with bodily fluids of the patient, or has been contaminated in some other manner. Examples of medical devices <b>12</b> include, but are not limited to, disposable and non-disposable medical devices used in the intubation, extubation and airway management of patients, cotton, gowns, masks, adhesive tape, bandages, gauze, gloves and the like. It is also contemplated that the medical devices <b>12</b> may include biohazard materials such as material, e.g., airway devices, gauze, bandages, gloves, gowns, cotton, that is saturated in blood or a bodily secretion. Should biohazard materials be disposed of in the receptacle <b>10</b>, the receptacle must be disposed of according to proper biohazard disposal procedures.</p>
<p id="p-0046" num="0045">The receptacle <b>10</b> includes an elongate base <b>14</b> and a cover <b>16</b>. The cover <b>16</b> and the elongate base <b>14</b> are hingedly secured to one another. In one embodiment, the elongate base <b>14</b> and the cover <b>16</b> are made from a polymeric material such as, for example, polyvinyl chloride (PVC), polyester, polypropylene, polyethylene or a combination thereof. It is contemplated that the elongate base <b>14</b> may be made of the same or different polymeric material as the cover <b>16</b>. The polymeric material used to form the elongate base <b>14</b> and the cover <b>16</b> may be of any color and may be either translucent or opaque. It is contemplated that the polymeric material can be of any thickness desired by the user, for example, a flexible film of about 2 mm in thickness.</p>
<p id="p-0047" num="0046">While polymeric materials are discussed herein, it is also contemplated that other materials may be utilized to make one or more of the elongate base <b>14</b> and the cover <b>16</b>, including, but not limited to, fabric such as canvas or denim, nylon, cardboard, and the like. For example, in one embodiment, the elongate base <b>14</b> may be made of cardboard while the cover may be made of a polymeric material. It is also contemplated that the elongate base <b>14</b> and the cover <b>16</b> are an integral flexible tube.</p>
<p id="p-0048" num="0047">As best shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>1</b> and <b>2</b></figref>, the cover <b>16</b> and the elongate base <b>14</b> are hingedly secured to one another by a seam <b>18</b> therebetween. The seam <b>18</b> can be a result of a heat seal if the cover <b>16</b> and elongate base <b>14</b> are made from a polymeric material. If at least one of the cover <b>16</b> and the elongate base <b>14</b> are made from a material other than a polymeric material, the seam <b>18</b> may be made from an adhesive material, sewn stitches or another sealing means known in the art. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>1</b> and <b>2</b></figref>, the elongate base <b>14</b> and the cover <b>16</b> may also be hingedly secured to one another by a second seam <b>18</b><i>a </i>along a first edge <b>16</b><i>a </i>of the cover <b>16</b> and a third seam <b>18</b><i>b </i>along a second edge <b>16</b><i>b </i>of the cover.</p>
<p id="p-0049" num="0048">The cover <b>16</b> and the elongate base <b>14</b> cooperate to define an envelope <b>20</b> having mouth <b>22</b> extending into an interior area <b>24</b> of the envelope. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>1</b> and <b>2</b></figref>, the cover <b>16</b> and the elongate base <b>14</b> include several seams <b>18</b>, <b>18</b><i>a </i>and <b>18</b><i>b </i>to define the envelope <b>20</b>. As best illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>, in one embodiment, the mouth <b>22</b> has a V-shaped configuration; however, the receptacle <b>10</b> is not limited in this regard as the mouth can have other configurations desired by a user, such as, for example, a square-shaped configuration, a semi-circular-shaped configuration, oblong opening, rectangle, multi-segmented, straight, or the like. The length L<b>1</b> of cover <b>16</b> is shorter than the length L<b>2</b> of base <b>14</b> at mouth <b>22</b>, so that when the cover is flattened against the base, a portion of the upwardly facing inner base surface <b>14</b><i>a </i>at mouth <b>22</b> is exposed vertically upward.</p>
<p id="p-0050" num="0049">The receptacle <b>10</b> may also include a biasing member communicating with the cover <b>16</b>. The biasing member is configured to bias the mouth <b>22</b> in an open position for receiving the medical device <b>12</b> through the mouth into the interior area <b>24</b>. In one embodiment, as illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>1</b> and <b>2</b></figref>, the biasing member is defined by a fold <b>26</b> in the cover <b>16</b>. The fold <b>26</b> is positioned between a first edge <b>16</b><i>a </i>of the cover <b>16</b> and a second edge <b>16</b><i>b </i>of the cover. While <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref> illustrates the fold <b>26</b> as being positioned roughly equidistant between the first edge <b>16</b><i>a </i>and the second edge <b>16</b><i>b</i>, the fold may be positioned at any location on the cover <b>16</b> between the first edge and the second edge.</p>
<p id="p-0051" num="0050">While not illustrated herein, it is contemplated that the biasing member may be defined by more than one fold <b>26</b> in the cover. The at least one fold <b>26</b> is secured in the seam <b>18</b> and fans progressively outward toward the mouth <b>22</b>. While the fold is shown between a first edge <b>16</b><i>a </i>of the cover <b>16</b> and the second edge <b>16</b><i>b </i>of the cover, it is contemplated that the elongate base may also have one or more folds. Further it is contemplated that the biasing member may also be one or more folds in the cover <b>16</b> together with one or more folds in the elongate base <b>14</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0052" num="0051">It is contemplated that if the biasing member is a fold <b>26</b> (on either or both the cover <b>16</b> and the elongate base <b>14</b>), the receptacle <b>10</b> is able to be stored in a substantially flat configuration as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref>. After deployment of the receptacle <b>10</b>, i.e., removal from storage for use, the receptacle should be able to stay at least partially open in a tent-like structure as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b></figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0053" num="0052">In order to allow the interior area <b>24</b> to expand so that one or more medical devices <b>12</b> can be inserted therein, the first edge <b>16</b><i>a </i>and the second edge <b>16</b><i>b </i>flex relative to the elongate base <b>14</b> and also flex relative to one another. Additionally, the interior area <b>24</b> expands to permit insertion of one or more medical devices <b>12</b> when a width W<b>1</b> of the elongate base <b>14</b> is smaller than a width W<b>2</b> of the cover <b>16</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>). In another embodiment, it is contemplated that the width W<b>1</b> of elongate base <b>14</b> is larger than the width W<b>2</b> of the cover <b>16</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b></figref>).</p>
<p id="p-0054" num="0053">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b>A</figref>, the fold <b>26</b> may include two outwardly facing folds <b>26</b><i>a </i>and two inwardly facing folds <b>26</b><i>b</i>. Folds <b>26</b>, <b>26</b><i>a </i>and <b>26</b><i>b </i>are, for example, creases in the material used to make the cover <b>16</b>. While not illustrated, it is contemplated that the fold <b>26</b> can have more or less than two outwardly facing folds <b>26</b><i>a </i>and more or less than two inwardly facing folds <b>26</b><i>b</i>. The outwardly facing folds <b>26</b><i>a </i>and the inwardly facing folds <b>26</b><i>b </i>are secured in the seam <b>18</b>. A similar fold configuration may be utilized on the elongate base <b>14</b> instead of, or in addition to, the fold configuration on the cover <b>16</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0055" num="0054">The biasing member may also be a differential length, i.e., the length of the cover <b>16</b> may be shorter than the length of the elongate base <b>14</b>, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>, or vice versa (not shown). The difference in length may further promote the separation of the elongate base <b>14</b> from the cover <b>16</b> thereby allowing easy insertion of a medical device into the mouth <b>22</b> of the receptacle <b>10</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0056" num="0055">In another embodiment, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>7</b></figref>, the mouth <b>22</b> has a U-shaped configuration and the biasing member may be an elastomeric ring <b>28</b>, such as a D-shaped ring, is secured to the mouth <b>22</b>. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref> illustrates the mouth <b>22</b> of cover <b>16</b> having a semi-circular-shaped configuration; however, the receptacle <b>10</b> is not limited in this regard since the mouth can have any shaped configuration with an elastomeric ring secured thereto. While a D-shaped ring is illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>7</b></figref>, the ring <b>28</b> is not limited in this regard as it may be an O-shaped, or other-shaped ring.</p>
<p id="p-0057" num="0056">The receptacle <b>10</b> may have no fold on the cover and/or an elongate base <b>14</b> and cover <b>16</b> made of different material, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>6</b></figref>. In another embodiment, it is contemplated that the biasing means may simply be the thickness of the material used to make elongate base <b>14</b> and the cover <b>16</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0058" num="0057">While not illustrated in the drawings, it is contemplated that the mouth <b>22</b>, or a portion of the mouth, may be distinguished from the other portions of the receptacle <b>10</b> in order to promote easy identification of the mouth. For example, the mouth <b>22</b> or a portion of the mouth may be a different color than the remainder of the receptacle <b>10</b>, or have printing thereon. Further examples of distinguishing characteristics for the mouth <b>22</b> include but are not limited to having a raised structure, a rolled structure, or a folded structure.</p>
<p id="p-0059" num="0058">It is contemplated that the biasing member may be any device or mechanism that is configured to bias the mouth <b>22</b> in an open position for receiving the medical device <b>12</b> through the mouth into the interior area <b>24</b>. For example, the biasing member may be flexible material, e.g., an elastomer, of any shape that is attached to the mouth <b>22</b> or to a portion of the cover <b>16</b> facing the elongate base <b>14</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0060" num="0059">The dimensions of receptacle <b>10</b> can be altered to suit the needs of a user. For example, the receptacle <b>10</b> can be made in several different sizes so it can be used in different settings. Some settings may prefer large receptacles <b>10</b> to accommodate bulky, large or many medical devices <b>12</b> while other settings may prefer smaller receptacles due to space constraints or the use of smaller or fewer medical devices. Accordingly, the size of the receptacle <b>10</b> and the size of the cover <b>16</b> and elongate base <b>14</b> can be varied.</p>
<p id="p-0061" num="0060">The receptacle <b>10</b> may be manufactured by any method known in the art, and the particular apparatus and devices used may vary depending on the size of the receptacle and/or the materials used to make the receptacle. In general, the receptacle <b>10</b> is made by hingedly securing the cover <b>16</b> and the elongate base <b>14</b> such that the cover and the elongate base cooperate to define the envelope <b>20</b> having the mouth <b>22</b> extending into the interior area <b>24</b> of the envelope. After the cover <b>16</b> and the elongate base <b>14</b> are hingedly secured, a biasing member is positioned to communicate with the cover and to bias the mouth <b>22</b> in an open position for receiving the medical device <b>12</b> through the mouth into the interior area <b>24</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0062" num="0061">Several receptacles <b>10</b> may be stored in flattened form stacked atop one another in a dispenser <b>30</b> as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>8</b></figref>. The dispenser <b>30</b> includes an opening <b>32</b> that allows a user to grab a fold <b>26</b> of the receptacle <b>10</b> and remove the receptacle from the dispenser. Upon removing the receptacle <b>10</b> from the dispenser in such a fashion, the mouth <b>22</b> is biased in an open position for receiving the medical device <b>12</b>, i.e., it is deployed for use. The dispenser <b>30</b> promotes grabbing the receptacle <b>10</b> at a specific portion of the receptacle that promotes easy removal from the dispenser and easy deployment of the receptacle for use.</p>
<p id="p-0063" num="0062">After the receptacle <b>10</b> is dispensed and the mouth <b>22</b> is biased in an open position, the receptacle is positioned at a location that is easily accessible to medical personnel, such as a doctor or nurse, while they are monitoring or managing a patient. Such a location may be, for example, on an anesthesia machine, on a cart, on an OR table next to the patient or on a portion of the patient's body, such as the patient's chest or back. In one example, the receptacle <b>10</b> may be positioned such that it is fastened, e.g., with tape, to the medical personnel or to a surface <b>34</b> such as the top or side of an OR table.</p>
<p id="p-0064" num="0063">After the receptacle <b>10</b> is removed from the dispenser <b>30</b>, a clean medical device, such as a laryngoscope blade of a laryngoscope, can be stored in the receptacle during a medical procedure in accordance with the present invention. A laryngoscope such as that shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>9</b>-<b>13</b></figref> consists of a cylindrical handle <b>12</b><i>a </i>for gripping by the operator and a removable blade <b>12</b><i>b </i>for insertion into the patient's airway, as the patient lies on his or her back, to obtain a view of the vocal folds and the glottis. Blade <b>12</b><i>b</i>, which is connected to handle <b>12</b><i>a </i>by a hinge <b>12</b><i>c </i>which swings approximately 90 degrees, may be inserted into the mouth <b>22</b> of the receptacle <b>10</b> with the base of the laryngoscope blade resting on base portion <b>14</b><i>a </i>and protruding through the mouth <b>22</b>. The laryngoscope handle <b>12</b><i>a </i>can be attached to the base of the blade <b>12</b><i>b </i>while holding the blade in the receptacle, thus isolating the clean blade from a handle that is or may potentially be contaminated. Such an arrangement allows for engaging the blade <b>12</b><i>b </i>to the handle <b>12</b><i>a</i>, testing the assembled handle, checking the light, and storing the assembled laryngoscope in a folded and ready-to-use configuration in the receptacle <b>10</b> with the clean blade <b>12</b><i>b </i>isolated from the potentially contaminated handle <b>12</b><i>a</i>. Additionally, it is noted that once the laryngoscope blade <b>12</b><i>b </i>is used on a patient and is therefore contaminated, it can then be inserted into the mouth <b>22</b> of the receptacle <b>10</b>, thereby isolating it from contaminating the handle, other device, equipment or people. The shorter cover <b>16</b> length permits the blade <b>12</b><i>b </i>to rest on the inner surface of base <b>14</b>, while the blade base portion hingedly connected to the handle <b>12</b><i>a </i>is beyond the end of cover <b>16</b>, and the remaining portion of the laryngoscope handle <b>12</b><i>a </i>rests on top of the upper surface of cover <b>16</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0065" num="0064">After a medical device <b>12</b> is used on the patient, or otherwise contaminated, the medical device is inserted into the receptacle <b>10</b> for disposal or storage. It is contemplated that at least a contaminated portion of the medical device <b>12</b> can be stored in the receptacle <b>10</b> without contaminating another portion of the medical device, the surrounding environment, people or other medical devices. The medical device <b>12</b> is inserted through the mouth <b>22</b> to the interior area <b>24</b>. It is contemplated that the medical device <b>12</b> is a disposable device, that is, it is not reusable; however, there may be instances where there are entire medical devices or portions of medical devices that are reusable after cleaning and/or sterilization. In an instance where an entire medical device <b>12</b> or a portion of a medical device can be reused, that device or portion is removed from the receptacle <b>10</b> before the receptacle is discarded.</p>
<p id="p-0066" num="0065"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>9</b>-<b>13</b></figref> illustrate use of receptacle <b>10</b> to store a laryngoscope blade during surgery or other medical procedure in more detail. Initially, the operator or user may identify the laryngoscope handle and identify the laryngoscope blade still in its original packaging from the manufacturer. The operator may tear an opening on the blade packaging near the blade base and attach the handle to the blade while keeping the body of the blade still inside the packaging. The operator may extend the blade to test the light and proper functioning of the laryngoscope to ensure that it is operable. The operator may then identify the receptacle to be used to store the blade during the medical procedure, which may be the original packaging, or only a portion of the original packaging. If the receptacle is not the original packaging, the operator removes and discards the blade packaging from the laryngoscope. The operator holds the laryngoscope by handle <b>12</b><i>a </i>with one hand <b>36</b>, inserts the blade part <b>12</b><i>b </i>of the laryngoscope into the opening <b>22</b> of the receptacle <b>10</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>9</b></figref>), and folds the laryngoscope (so that the handle and blade are substantially parallel) to extinguish the laryngoscope light (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>10</b></figref>). As described previously, the receptacle <b>10</b> has a base <b>14</b> for contact with the surface <b>32</b> and an opposite, cover out of contact with the surface. The cover <b>16</b> may be shorter than the base <b>14</b> at the mouth <b>22</b> of the receptacle to facilitate insertion of the blade into the interior of the receptacle and permit the blade <b>12</b><i>b </i>to remain isolated and out of contact with the underlying surface when the handle <b>12</b><i>a </i>is folded down. The present invention maintains the cleanliness of the blade by ensuring that the blade remains inside the receptacle, and the handle remains outside the receptacle, thus preventing the blade (except the base) from coming in contact with the handle, hands, and the surrounding environment. The receptacle is then positioned on a substantially horizontal surface <b>34</b> within easy reach, for example, on the operating table or another table within an arm's reach of the operator while standing or sitting near the patient's head. An adhesive may be provided on the exterior surface of the receptacle base <b>14</b> to permit it to be removably secured to the surface to maintain it in the desired position. The laryngoscope is now in standby position ready for use.</p>
<p id="p-0067" num="0066">The operator, who is normally a certified medical practitioner, may then prepare for the medical procedure by pre-oxygenating the patient and inducing, i.e., making unconscious, the patient. The operator may mask ventilate the patient and place an oral or nasal airway in the patient as needed to help with mask ventilation. The operator then identifies the laryngoscope stored nearby in standby position with the blade in receptacle <b>10</b> and, after the patient is asleep, grasp the handle with one hand, e.g., the left hand, unfolds the handle approximately 90 degrees away from the blade to turn on the light, and removes the laryngoscope from the receptacle (not shown). The now empty receptacle is maintained within easy reach with the mouth <b>22</b> of the receptacle in the open position. If an oral airway <b>12</b><i>d </i>or nasal airway was previously used, the operator may remove it from the patient and place it into the receptacle <b>10</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>12</b></figref>) to prevent contamination of the airway device from the surrounding environment and also to prevent the contamination of the surrounding environment with the device. The operator may then open the patient's mouth with the other hand, e.g., the right hand, while still holding the laryngoscope in the left hand and, using the left hand, insert the blade into patient's oral cavity (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>11</b></figref>). As the left hand maintains its grip on the laryngoscope, the operator may visualize the patient's vocal cords and, using the right hand, insert the endotracheal tube (ETT) <b>12</b><i>e </i>(<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>12</b></figref>) through the vocal cords until the cuff of the ETT just passes beyond the vocal cords. With the left hand holding the laryngoscope and the right hand holding the ETT, the operator may take note of the depth marking on ETT at teeth.</p>
<p id="p-0068" num="0067">While maintaining control of the ETT with the right hand, the operator may then remove the blade from the patient's oral cavity and, without releasing grip of the laryngoscope handle <b>12</b><i>a </i>and without permitting the blade <b>12</b><i>b </i>to contact anything else, insert the substantial part of the blade <b>12</b><i>b </i>into the receptacle interior <b>24</b> through its opening <b>22</b> using the left hand <b>36</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>9</b></figref>). Having the opening <b>22</b> in a wide open configuration helps with the insertion of the blade <b>12</b><i>b</i>, which may now be dripping with the mucus, saliva or blood from the patient's oral cavity into the interior <b>24</b> of the receptacle and substantially contain the debris from contaminating the lips of the mouth opening <b>22</b>, the exterior surface of cover <b>16</b>, the exterior surface of base <b>14</b>, the area <b>34</b> on which the receptacle is disposed, personnel, other medical equipment, and the surrounding. After inserting the blade into the receptacle, the operator may fold the laryngoscope handle toward the blade while the blade is pushed against the interior surface of the receptacle, so that handle (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>10</b>, <b>12</b></figref><i>a</i>) and blade (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>10</b>, <b>12</b></figref><i>b</i>) are now collapsed to extinguish the laryngoscope light, and release the handle from the left hand. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>10</b></figref>, laryngoscope stored in collapsed configuration. After releasing the handle <b>12</b><i>a </i>the operator ensures that the blade is prevented from coming in contact with the handle, the operator or the surface on which the receptacle is disposed and remains isolated substantially inside the receptacle interior, while the handle remains outside and on the receptacle cover, without the handle touching the surface on which the receptacle is disposed (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>10</b></figref>). This prevents the now soiled blade from contaminating the handle, hands or the surrounding environment and also ensures that the blade does not get contaminated by the handle, hands or the surrounding environment. The operation of storing the laryngoscope may be performed in a one-handed manner, and does not require the use of the operator's other hand. The laryngoscope is then available in temporary storage for reuse later if necessary.</p>
<p id="p-0069" num="0068">The operator may then continue with the medical procedure and inflate the ETT cuff with a syringe, attach the ventilator to the ETT, ventilate the patient by squeezing the ventilator bag, and ensure that the ETT is in trachea by checking the presence of end tidal CO2 (ETCO2). The operator may subsequently initiate positive pressure ventilation, ascultate patient's lungs, &#x2014;compare the depth marking of the ETT to previously noted depth marking, and correct any migration of the ETT further into or out of the trachea before securing the ETT to the patient, usually with tape. Expeditious confirmation of intubation of the trachea (versus intubation of the esophagus) and prevention of unintended extubation of ETT (therefore the continuous attention to the ETT until it is secured) is of utmost importance and takes precedence over all other activities. The operator may then complete any other urgent patient care tasks. The above activities are some examples of the important patient care tasks that must be accomplished quickly. The medical care provider often lacks the luxury of time or opportunities to dispose of the soiled laryngoscope or other equipment that takes time or attention away from the patient care. The open-mouthed, easy to use configuration of the receptacle in an easy to reach location helps with the containment of the contamination and also allows the operator to do it quickly, with one hand, without taking time or attention away from the patient care where even a momentarily lapse in attention to the patient may result in severe detriment to the patient's wellbeing.</p>
<p id="p-0070" num="0069">After the immediate patient care needs are met, if not immediately needed, the operator may collect the laryngoscope and the other appliances or devices from the patient area and store them on another location for possible use at a later time. When the laryngoscope and other items stored with the receptacle are no longer needed, the operator may detach the handle from the blade while keeping the blade still inside the receptacle, and discard the blade along with the receptacle in a proper location. If the blade is a reusable type, it can be taken to the processing area while still in the receptacle to prevent contamination of the surrounding environment.</p>
<p id="p-0071" num="0070">At the conclusion of the surgery, a new or additional receptacle can be placed within easy reach with the mouth of the receptacle in an open position. When the patient is ready for extubation, the ETT can be removed from the patient and placed into the receptacle. The soiled ETT <b>12</b><i>e</i>, as well as the laryngoscope blade <b>12</b><i>b</i>, often dripping with mucus, saliva and blood, can be inserted into and contained within the receptacle <b>10</b> without allowing the debris from the distal end of ETT, or the tip and body portion of the blade to come in contact with the lips of the opening of the receptacle, exterior surfaces of the receptacle, the surface on which the receptacle is disposed, or the operator. The wide open-mouth configuration and placement of the receptacle provide minimal chance of soiling the lips of the opening or the exterior surfaces of the receptacle and permits the ETT and/or blade to be inserted into the receptacle with little attention to and with minimal manipulation of the receptacle by the operator. This prevents contamination of the surrounding environment and permits proper disposal as time permits. (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>14</b></figref>) Having the receptacle available within easy reach and in an easy to use configuration enables the operator to quickly and properly dispose of the soiled ETT without having to take attention away from the patient or even look away from the patient during the critical time of emergence when catastrophic events such as vomiting, aspiration, and airway obstruction are most likely to occur.</p>
<p id="p-0072" num="0071">Another aspect of the invention is directed to medical devices such as laryngoscope blades pre-packaged into the receptacle <b>10</b>. In such an embodiment, the receptacle <b>10</b> includes a perforation, pre-cut, thinned-out, or otherwise modified or weakened area to achieve the opening <b>22</b> as described above by simple removal or manipulation, e.g., tearing off, pulling part, and the like. Such removal would allow deployment of the receptacle <b>10</b> for use as described above.</p>
<p id="p-0073" num="0072">A further aspect of the invention is to fold the wider portion of the receptacle <b>10</b>, either the elongate base <b>14</b> or the cover <b>16</b>, in such a way as to achieve a flat configuration of the receptacle. Such flat configuration is further enhanced by sealing or constructing the non-opening end to promote a low profile and allowing a propagation of such fold or profile to extend to the end of the receptacle <b>10</b> having the opening <b>22</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0074" num="0073">While a laryngoscope is mentioned in the instant application, the present invention is not limited to a receptacle holding such a medical device. Indeed, any device or item, clean or contaminated, may be placed in the receptacle <b>10</b>.
