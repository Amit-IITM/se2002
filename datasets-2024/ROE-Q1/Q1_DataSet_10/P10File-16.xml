<p id="p-0007" num="0006">Another example is any such vessel, wherein: the valve top portion has a vertical dimension when contracted that is less than or equal to the vertical gap in-between the bottom surface of the bottom central portion and the bottom surface of the bottom perimeter portion; and the valve top portion has a second vertical dimension when expanded that is greater than the vertical gap in-between the bottom surface of the bottom central portion and the bottom surface of the bottom perimeter portion.</p>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">Another example is any such vessel, wherein the valve central portion comprises: a wide region configured to at least substantially seal the opening; and a narrow region configured to unseal the opening so as to provide an air passageway through the opening.</p>
<p id="p-0009" num="0008">Another example is any such vessel, wherein: the wide region is a top wide region that is configured to at least substantially seal the opening when the valve central portion is moved downward in relation to the lid; and the narrow region is a bottom narrow region that is configured to unseal the opening so as to provide an air passageway through the opening when the valve central portion is moved upward in relation to the lid.</p>
<p id="p-0010" num="0009">Another example is any such vessel, wherein the vessel is configured to be heated in a microwave oven while the vessel is sealed by the lid.</p>
<p id="p-0011" num="0010">Another example is any such vessel, wherein the lid further comprises: a central portion, wherein the central portion of the lid comprises the portion of the lid; an annular gasket positioned to surround a perimeter of the central portion of the lid; and an annular lid rim positioned to surround a perimeter of at least a portion of the gasket.</p>
<p id="p-0012" num="0011">Another example is any such vessel, wherein the annular gasket comprises: an upper portion coupling the gasket to the central portion; a vertical portion descending downward from the upper portion of the gasket, the vertical portion having an outer side that is positioned horizontally inward from an external edge of the upper portion of the gasket; and a flexible skirt extending horizontally outward from the outer side of the vertical portion of the gasket.</p>
<p id="p-0013" num="0012">Another example is any such vessel, wherein the container and the portion of the lid are both made of glass.</p>
<p id="p-0014" num="0013">Another example is any such vessel, wherein the container has one or more indentations in an external surface of the sidewall of the container, wherein the one or more indentations extend upward to the rim of the container.</p>
<p id="p-0015" num="0014">Another example is any such vessel, wherein the valve top portion comprises: a substantially circular top level having an opening in the center; a bottom level; and two or more connecting segments that spiral upward from the bottom level to the substantially circular top level.</p>
<p id="p-0016" num="0015">Another example is any such vessel, wherein the valve top portion comprises an upward curved flap, the upward curved flap having an opening in the center of the upward curved flap, the upward curved flap being coupled to the valve central portion at a bottom section of the curvature of the upward curved flap.</p>
<p id="p-0017" num="0016">Another example is any such vessel, wherein at least a portion of the valve plug is made of silicone rubber.</p>
<p id="p-0018" num="0017">In a third example, a removable lid for a container of a vessel comprises: a valve configured to selectively allow air to vent out of a fluid retaining interior region of the container when the lid is positioned on the container, the valve comprising an opening that extends entirely through a thickness of a portion of the lid, the valve further comprising a valve plug that comprises: a valve top portion that extends vertically above a top surface of the portion of the lid, wherein the valve top portion is configured to be contracted, by a downward pressure, into a more vertically compact shape, wherein the valve top portion is further configured to, absent the downward pressure, expand back upwards out of the more vertically compact shape, wherein the valve top portion includes a top level configured to move downwards towards a top surface of the portion of the lid when the valve top portion is contracted into the more vertically compact shape, wherein the valve top portion further includes a bottom level configured to remain substantially in the same position when the valve top portion is contracted into the more vertically compact shape; a valve bottom portion that extends vertically below a bottom surface of the portion of the lid; and a valve central portion positioned at least partially within the opening of the portion of the lid, the valve central portion coupling the valve top portion to the valve bottom portion.</p>
<p id="p-0019" num="0018">Another example is any such removable lid, wherein the valve central portion comprises: a wide region configured to at least substantially seal the opening; and a narrow region configured to unseal the opening so as to provide an air passageway through the opening.</p>
<p id="p-0020" num="0019">Another example is any such removable lid, wherein the wide region is a top wide region that is configured to at least substantially seal the opening when the valve central portion is moved downward in relation to the lid; and the narrow region is a bottom narrow region that is configured to unseal the opening so as to provide an air passageway through the opening when the valve central portion is moved upward in relation to the lid.</p>
<p id="p-0021" num="0020">Another example is any such removable lid, wherein the lid further comprises: a central portion, wherein the central portion of the lid comprises the portion of the lid; an annular gasket positioned to surround a perimeter of the central portion of the lid; and an annular lid rim positioned to surround a perimeter of at least a portion of the gasket.</p>

<heading id="h-0006" level="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION</heading>
<p id="p-0052" num="0051">Embodiments of the present disclosure are best understood by referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>1</b>A-<b>13</b>C</figref> of the drawings, like numerals being used for like and corresponding parts of the various drawings.</p>
<p id="p-0053" num="0052">Typically, food items (e.g., leftover food items) may be stored in a plastic storage container having a removable lid. These typical storage containers, however, may be deficient. For example, some of these typical storage containers may not be heated in a microwave oven.</p>
<p id="p-0054" num="0053">In contrast, the food storage or cooking vessel(s) of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>1</b>A-<b>13</b>C</figref> may address one or more of the deficiencies of these typical storage containers. For example, the food storage or cooking vessel(s) of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>1</b>A-<b>13</b>C</figref> may be heated in a microwave oven (even when the food storage or cooking vessel is sealed by a lid). This may, in some examples, prevent a user from having to move food items from a typical storage container to a microwavable dish prior to heating the food items in the microwave oven. As another example, the food storage or cooking vessel(s) of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>1</b>A-<b>13</b>C</figref> may be able to vent during microwave cooking. As another example, the food storage or cooking vessel(s) of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>1</b>A-<b>13</b>C</figref> may allow the food items to be visible through the top or sides of the food storage or cooking vessel, and preferably from both the sides and top of the food storage or cooking vessel. As a further example, the food storage or cooking vessel(s) of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>1</b>A-<b>13</b>C</figref> may be secure (e.g., it may be engagingly sealed), and may not leak or allow food items to fall out when the food storage or cooking vessel is inverted.</p>
<p id="p-0055" num="0054"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>1</b>A-<b>2</b></figref> illustrate one example of a food storage or cooking vessel <b>100</b>. As is illustrated, the food storage or cooking vessel <b>100</b> comprises a container <b>110</b> and a lid <b>200</b>. The container <b>110</b> may be any type of container or vessel for holding, storing, and/or cooking (e.g., heating, cooling, etc.) a food item (e.g., solid food, liquid, etc.). For example, the container <b>110</b> may be a glass food storage or cooking container that may store food (such as leftover food), and that may further be used to re-heat the leftover food (e.g., in a microwave oven) while it is still stored in the container <b>110</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0056" num="0055">The container <b>110</b> includes a bottom <b>120</b>. The bottom <b>120</b> may be the base of the container <b>110</b>, and may support the container <b>110</b> (e.g., hold it upright) when it is positioned on a surface. The bottom <b>120</b> may have any shape. For example, an external surface <b>120</b><i>a </i>of the bottom <b>120</b>, an internal surface <b>120</b><i>b </i>of the bottom <b>120</b>, or the entire bottom <b>120</b> may be shaped as a circle, an oval, a square, a rectangle, a diamond, an irregular shape, any other shape, or any combination of the preceding. As is illustrated, the entire bottom <b>120</b> (and the container <b>110</b>) is shaped as a circle (e.g., it has circular symmetry). The bottom <b>120</b> may further have any size. For example, the bottom <b>120</b> may have any length (or diameter), and any thickness.</p>
<p id="p-0057" num="0056">The bottom <b>120</b> may be oriented horizontally when the container <b>110</b> is resting on the bottom <b>120</b>. In some examples, the bottom <b>120</b> may be oriented substantially horizontally (e.g., horizontal +/&#x2212;5 degrees) when the container <b>110</b> is resting on the bottom <b>120</b>. The external surface <b>120</b><i>a </i>and/or the internal surface <b>120</b><i>b </i>of the bottom <b>120</b> may have any degree of curvature and/or angle. For example, one (or both) of external surface <b>120</b><i>a </i>and the internal surface <b>120</b><i>b </i>may be flat, substantially flat (e.g., flat +/&#x2212;5 degrees), convex, concave, or have any other degree of curvature and/or angle. As is illustrated, the external surface <b>120</b><i>a </i>has a concave shape and the internal surface <b>120</b><i>b </i>as a convex shape, causing the bottom <b>120</b> to curve upwards from a horizontal plane.</p>
<p id="p-0058" num="0057">The container <b>110</b> further includes an upward extending sidewall <b>130</b> that is connected to and surrounds the bottom <b>120</b>. The sidewall <b>130</b> extends upward from the bottom <b>120</b> so as to form a fluid retaining interior region <b>190</b> of the container <b>110</b>. The sidewall <b>130</b> may extend upward from the bottom <b>120</b> at any upward extending angle. For example, the sidewall <b>130</b> may extend upward at or substantially at (e.g., +/&#x2212;5 degrees) 90 degrees, 85 degrees, 80 degrees, 70 degrees, 60 degrees, 45 degrees, 95 degrees, 100 degrees, 110 degrees, 120 degrees, 135 degrees, any other upward extending angle, or any angle (or range of angles) in-between 45 degrees and 135 degrees.</p>
<p id="p-0059" num="0058">The sidewall <b>130</b> may have an external surface <b>130</b><i>a </i>that defines a horizontally outermost portion of the sidewall <b>130</b>, and an internal surface <b>130</b><i>b </i>that defines a horizontally innermost portion of the sidewall <b>130</b>. The external surface <b>130</b><i>a </i>and/or internal surface <b>130</b><i>b </i>may have any degree of curvature and/or angle. For example, one (or both) of the external surface <b>130</b><i>a </i>and the internal surface <b>130</b><i>b </i>may be flat, substantially flat (e.g., flat +/&#x2212;5 degrees), convex, concave, or have any other degree of curvature and/or angle. As another example, one (or both) of the external surface <b>130</b><i>a </i>and the internal surface <b>130</b><i>b </i>may be curved, such as by having a degree of curvature of or substantially of (e.g., +/&#x2212;5 degrees) 60 degrees, 55 degrees, 50 degree, 45 degrees, 40 degrees, 35 degrees, 30 degrees, any other degree of curvature, or any degree of curvature (or range of degrees of curvature) in-between 30 degrees and 60 degrees. The sidewall <b>130</b> may have any thickness.</p>
<p id="p-0060" num="0059">The sidewall <b>130</b> may extend upward until it terminates at a rim <b>140</b> that defines an upper opening <b>150</b> of the container <b>110</b>. This upper opening <b>150</b> may allow food to be inserted into and/or removed from the fluid retaining interior region <b>190</b> of the container <b>110</b>. The rim, upper opening <b>150</b>, or the entire container <b>110</b> may be shaped as a circle, an oval, a square, a rectangle, a diamond, an irregular shape, any other shape, or any combination of the preceding. As is illustrated, container <b>110</b> is shaped as a circle (e.g., it has circular symmetry). The upper opening <b>150</b> may have any size. For example, the upper opening <b>150</b> may have any length (or diameter) in-between two opposing portions of the sidewall <b>130</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0061" num="0060">The rim <b>140</b> of the container <b>110</b> may be positioned at any vertical distance from the bottom <b>120</b>. For example, the rim <b>140</b> may be positioned at a vertical distance of or substantially of (e.g., +/&#x2212;10%) 0.5 inches from the bottom <b>120</b>, 1 inch from the bottom <b>120</b>, 2 inches from the bottom <b>120</b>, 3 inches from the bottom <b>120</b>, 5 inches from the bottom <b>120</b>, 6 inches from the bottom <b>120</b>, 8 inches from the bottom <b>120</b>, 10 inches from the bottom <b>120</b>, 12 inches from the bottom <b>120</b>, 24 inches from the bottom <b>120</b>, any other vertical distance from the bottom <b>120</b>, or any vertical distance (or range of vertical distances) in-between 0.5 inches and 24 inches. The external surface <b>130</b><i>a </i>of the sidewall <b>130</b> may define the horizontally outermost surface of the rim <b>140</b>, and the internal surface <b>130</b><i>b </i>of the sidewall <b>130</b> may define the horizontally innermost surface of the rim <b>140</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0062" num="0061">The container <b>110</b> may be made of any material(s) that may allow a food item to be held, stored, and/or cooked (e.g., heating in a microwave oven, cooled in a refrigerator, etc.) in the container <b>110</b>. For example, the container <b>110</b> may be made of plastic, glass, ceramic glass (e.g., opaque ceramic glass), pottery materials, non-metallic materials, any other material that may allow a food item to be held, stored, and/or cooked in the container <b>110</b>, or any combination of the preceding. As is illustrated, the container <b>110</b> is made of glass. The container <b>110</b> made of glass may allow the food storage or cooking vessel <b>100</b> to be heated in the microwave (i.e., the food items stored in the food storage or cooking vessel <b>100</b> may be heated in the microwave), in some examples. The container <b>110</b> made of glass (e.g., transparent glass) may also allow the food items stored in the food storage or cooking vessel <b>100</b> to be viewed through the sidewall <b>130</b> of the container <b>110</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0063" num="0062">As is discussed above, the food storage or cooking vessel <b>100</b> further includes a lid <b>200</b> that may be used to seal the container <b>110</b> and the food storage or cooking vessel <b>100</b>. This seal may prevent food items from spilling out of the fluid retaining interior region <b>190</b> of the container <b>110</b>. To seal the container <b>110</b>, the lid <b>200</b> may be configured to at least partially extend downward into the fluid retaining interior region <b>190</b> of the container <b>110</b> (e.g., it may extend downward past the rim <b>140</b>), and may be further configured to engagingly seal with the internal surface <b>130</b><i>b </i>of the sidewall <b>130</b> of the container <b>110</b>. The lid <b>200</b> may be removable, allowing the container <b>110</b> and food storage or cooking vessel <b>100</b> to be unsealed (e.g., for cleaning, to add food items to the food storage or cooking vessel <b>100</b>).</p>
<p id="p-0064" num="0063">As is illustrated, the lid <b>200</b> includes a central portion <b>210</b> that is surrounded by a gasket <b>220</b>. The central portion <b>210</b> may have any shape. For example, an external surface <b>210</b><i>a </i>of the central portion <b>210</b>, an internal surface <b>210</b><i>b </i>of the central portion <b>210</b>, or the entire central portion <b>210</b> may be shaped as a circle, an oval, a square, a rectangle, a diamond, an irregular shape, any other shape, or any combination of the preceding. As is illustrated, the central portion <b>210</b> (and the entire lid <b>200</b>) is shaped as a circle (e.g., it has circular symmetry). The central portion <b>210</b> may further have any size. For example, the central portion <b>210</b> may have any length (or diameter), and any thickness.</p>
<p id="p-0065" num="0064">The central portion <b>210</b> may be oriented horizontally when the lid <b>200</b> is positioned on the container <b>110</b>. In some examples, the central portion <b>210</b> may be oriented substantially horizontally (e.g., horizontal +/&#x2212;5 degrees) when the lid <b>200</b> is positioned on the container <b>110</b>. The external surface <b>210</b><i>a </i>and/or the internal surface <b>210</b><i>b </i>of the central portion <b>210</b> may have any degree of curvature and/or angle. For example, one (or both) of external surface <b>210</b><i>a </i>and the internal surface <b>210</b><i>b </i>may be flat, substantially flat (e.g., flat +/&#x2212;5 degrees), convex, concave, or have any other degree of curvature and/or angle. As is illustrated, the external surface <b>210</b><i>a </i>and the internal surface <b>210</b><i>b </i>are both flat, causing the central portion <b>210</b> to be planar.</p>
<p id="p-0066" num="0065">The central portion <b>210</b> may be made of any material(s) that may allow a food item to be held, stored, and/or cooked (e.g., heating in a microwave oven, cooled in a refrigerator, etc.) in the container <b>110</b> with the lid <b>200</b> on. For example, the central portion <b>210</b> may be made of plastic, glass, ceramic glass (e.g., opaque ceramic glass), pottery materials, non-metallic materials, any other material that may allow a food item to be held, stored, and/or cooked in the container <b>110</b> with the lid <b>200</b> on, or any combination of the preceding. As is illustrated, the central portion <b>210</b> is made of glass. The central portion <b>210</b> made of glass may allow the food storage or cooking vessel <b>100</b> to be heated in the microwave (i.e., the food items stored in the food storage or cooking vessel <b>100</b> may be heated in the microwave), in some examples. The central portion <b>210</b> made of glass (e.g., transparent glass) may also allow the food items stored in the food storage or cooking vessel <b>100</b> to be viewed through the top of the lid <b>200</b> of the food storage or cooking vessel <b>100</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0067" num="0066">The lid further includes the gasket <b>220</b>. The gasket <b>220</b> may be any device, element, or unit that may seal the junction between the central portion <b>210</b> and the internal surface <b>130</b><i>b </i>of the sidewall <b>130</b>, thereby sealing the container <b>100</b> and the food storage or cooking vessel <b>100</b>. The gasket <b>220</b> may have any shape and/or size. For example, the gasket <b>220</b> may be ring-shaped (i.e., annular), allowing the gasket <b>220</b> to surround the central portion <b>210</b> along the entire horizontal perimeter of the central portion <b>210</b>. Furthermore, the annular shape of the gasket <b>220</b> is not limited to a circle. Instead, the annular shape may include an annular circle, oval, square, rectangle, diamond, irregular shape, any other shape, or any combination of the preceding. Furthermore, the annular shape may include one or more elliptical segments, curvilinear segments, non-curvilinear segments, a combination of curvilinear and non-curvilinear segments, or any combination of the preceding. This may allow the gasket <b>220</b> to fit any shaped container <b>110</b>, such as an oval container <b>110</b> or a container <b>110</b> with a straight sides and rounded corners. Notwithstanding the alternative shapes of the gasket <b>220</b>, the gasket <b>220</b> should be shaped in coordination with the shape of the sidewall <b>130</b> taking into consideration the stiffness of the gasket sub-components so the gasket outer side <b>223</b><i>a </i>flexes to sealingly engage with the internal surface <b>130</b><i>b</i>. This flexure range should accommodate possible manufacturing variances of the vessel <b>100</b>, lid <b>200</b> and gasket <b>220</b> that irrespective of how the lid <b>200</b> is centered with respect to the rim <b>140</b>, the gasket outer side <b>223</b><i>a </i>will still make contact with the internal surface <b>130</b><i>b</i>. These variances can be accommodated by the ability of the flexible skirt <b>224</b> and the outer side <b>223</b><i>a </i>to deform.</p>
<p id="p-0068" num="0067">The gasket <b>220</b> may be made of any material(s) that allows the gasket <b>220</b> to seal the junction between the central portion <b>210</b> and the internal surface <b>130</b><i>b </i>of the sidewall <b>130</b>, thereby sealing the container <b>110</b> and the food storage or cooking vessel <b>100</b>. For example, the gasket <b>220</b> may be made of rubber, a polymer, an elastomer (e.g., silicone, fluorosilicone, etc.), any other material that allows the gasket <b>220</b> to seal the junction between the central portion <b>210</b> and the internal surface <b>130</b><i>b </i>of the sidewall <b>130</b> (thereby sealing the food storage or cooking vessel <b>100</b>), or any combination of the preceding.</p>
<p id="p-0069" num="0068">As is illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b>B</figref>, the gasket <b>220</b> includes an upper portion <b>221</b>, a vertical portion <b>223</b>, and a flexible skirt <b>224</b>. The upper portion <b>221</b> is configured to couple the gasket <b>220</b> to the central portion <b>210</b>. The upper portion <b>221</b> may be configured to couple the gasket <b>220</b> to the central portion <b>210</b> in any manner. For example, the upper portion <b>221</b> may include an adhesive that couples the gasket <b>220</b> to the central portion <b>210</b>. As another example, and as is illustrated, the upper portion <b>221</b> may include an inner groove <b>222</b> (e.g., an inner circumferential lateral groove) that may receive an outer peripheral region <b>210</b><i>a </i>(shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref>) of the central portion <b>210</b>. This inner groove <b>222</b> may hold the outer peripheral region <b>210</b><i>a</i>, thereby coupling the gasket <b>220</b> to the central portion <b>210</b>. As a further example, the upper portion <b>221</b> may include an outer peripheral region that is received into an inner groove in the central portion <b>210</b> (i.e., the reverse of the example described above). The upper portion <b>221</b> may include an external edge <b>221</b><i>a </i>that defines the horizontally outermost portion of the upper portion <b>221</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0070" num="0069">The upper portion <b>221</b> may have any size and/or shape. For example, the upper portion <b>221</b> may have a thickness (or other dimension) that causes the external edge <b>221</b><i>a </i>of the upper portion <b>221</b> to extend horizontally outward past the internal surface <b>130</b><i>b </i>of the sidewall <b>130</b>. In other examples, the upper portion <b>221</b> may have a thickness (or other dimension) that causes the external edge <b>221</b><i>a </i>of the upper portion <b>221</b> to extend horizontally outward past the external surface <b>130</b><i>a </i>of the sidewall <b>130</b>. By extending horizontally outward past the internal surface <b>130</b><i>b </i>and/or the external surface <b>130</b><i>b</i>, the size of the upper portion <b>221</b> may assist in preventing the gasket <b>220</b> (and lid <b>200</b>) from being pushed entirely within the fluid retaining interior region <b>190</b> of the container <b>110</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0071" num="0070">The gasket <b>220</b> further includes the vertical portion <b>223</b>. The vertical portion <b>223</b> of the gasket <b>220</b> descends downward from the upper portion <b>221</b> of the gasket <b>220</b>. The vertical portion <b>223</b> may descend downward from the upper portion <b>221</b> by a distance <b>225</b>. The distance <b>225</b> may be any length, such as or substantially (e.g., +/&#x2212;10%) 0.05 inches, 0.1 inches, 0.2 inches, 0.3 inches, 0.5 inches, 0.75 inches, 1 inch, 1.5 inches, 2 inches, 3 inches, any other length, or any length (or range of lengths) in-between 0.05 inches and 3 inches.</p>
<p id="p-0072" num="0071">The vertical portion <b>223</b> includes an outer side <b>223</b><i>a </i>that defines the horizontally outermost portion of the vertical portion <b>223</b>. The outer side <b>223</b><i>a </i>of the vertical portion <b>223</b> may be positioned inward (or be inset) from the external edge <b>221</b><i>a </i>of the upper portion <b>221</b> of the gasket <b>220</b>. This may allow the vertical portion <b>223</b> and the flexible skirt <b>224</b> to fit within the fluid retaining interior region <b>190</b> of the container <b>110</b>, while the upper portion <b>221</b> or a portion of the upper portion <b>221</b> remains outside of the fluid retaining interior region <b>190</b> of the container <b>110</b>. Such positioning may allow the gasket <b>220</b> to seal the junction between the central portion <b>210</b> and the internal surface <b>130</b><i>b </i>of the sidewall <b>130</b>, thereby sealing the food storage or cooking vessel <b>100</b>. The inward positioning of the vertical portion <b>223</b> in relation to the external edge <b>221</b><i>a </i>is illustrated as distance <b>226</b>. The distance <b>226</b> may be any length, such as or substantially (e.g., +/&#x2212;10%) 0.05 inches, 0.1 inches, 0.2 inches, 0.3 inches, 0.5 inches, 0.75 inches, 1 inch, 1.5 inches, any other length, or any length (or range of lengths) in-between 0.05 inches and 1.5 inches.</p>
<p id="p-0073" num="0072">The vertical portion <b>223</b> may descend downward from the upper portion <b>221</b> at an angle <b>227</b>. The angle <b>227</b> may be any angle that allows the outer side <b>223</b><i>a </i>of the vertical portion <b>223</b> to be positioned inward (or be inset) from the external edge <b>221</b><i>a </i>of the upper portion <b>221</b> of the gasket <b>220</b>. For example, the angle <b>227</b> may be or may be substantially (e.g., +/&#x2212;10%) 90 degrees, 85 degrees, 80 degrees, 75 degrees, 95 degrees, 100 degrees, 105 degrees, any other angle that allows the outer side <b>223</b><i>a </i>to be positioned inward from the external edge <b>221</b><i>a</i>, or any angle (or range of angles) in-between 75 degrees and 105 degrees.</p>
<p id="p-0074" num="0073">As is further illustrated, the gasket <b>220</b> also includes the flexible skirt <b>224</b>. The flexible skirt <b>224</b> extends horizontally outward from the outer side <b>223</b><i>a </i>of the vertical portion <b>223</b>. This extension causes the flexible skirt <b>224</b> to contact (and/or press against) the internal surface <b>130</b><i>b </i>of the sidewall <b>130</b>. This contact allows the gasket <b>220</b> (and lid <b>200</b>) to engagingly seal with the internal surface <b>130</b><i>b </i>of the sidewall <b>130</b> of the container <b>110</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0075" num="0074">The flexible skirt <b>224</b> may be configured so that at least a portion of the flexible skirt <b>224</b> may flex (or otherwise move) upward and downward. This flexibility may cause this portion of the flexible skirt <b>224</b> to be moved upwards by the internal surface <b>130</b><i>b </i>of the sidewall <b>130</b> of the container <b>110</b> (via friction and/or pressure) when the lid <b>200</b> is positioned on the container <b>110</b> (and the vertical portion <b>223</b> and vertical skirt <b>224</b> are positioned within the fluid retaining interior region <b>190</b> of the container <b>110</b>). An example of this upward movement is illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b>B</figref>, where the flexible skirt <b>224</b> is moved from an un-deformed state (shown in broken lines) to an upward deformed state (shown in solid lines). Furthermore, when the lid <b>200</b> is removed from the container <b>110</b>, the portion of the flexible skirt <b>224</b> may move downwards once again to the un-deformed state (shown in broken lines).</p>
<p id="p-0076" num="0075">The flexible skirt <b>224</b> may be configured in any way so as to allow the portion of the flexible skirt <b>224</b> to flex (or otherwise move) upward and downward. For example, the flexible skirt <b>224</b> may have any thickness (or other dimension) that allows such flexing. As another example, the material(s) of the gasket <b>220</b> and the flexible skirt <b>224</b> (e.g., a rubber, a polymer, an elastomer, as is discussed above) may allow (or contribute to allowing) such flexing.</p>
<p id="p-0077" num="0076">The flexible skirt <b>224</b> may have any size and/or shape that allows is to contact (and/or press against) the internal surface <b>130</b><i>b </i>of the sidewall <b>130</b>, so as to engagingly seal with the internal surface <b>130</b><i>b </i>of the sidewall <b>130</b> of the container <b>110</b>. For example, the flexible skirt <b>224</b> may extend horizontally outward in a horizontal plane (i.e., it may be flat) in its un-deformed state. As a preferable example, the flexible skirt <b>224</b> may have an upward curvature in its un-deformed state. This upward curvature (shown in the broken lines in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b>B</figref>) provides an inherent tendency to further curl upward (shown in the solid lines in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b>B</figref>) as it contacts the internal surface <b>130</b><i>b </i>of the sidewall <b>130</b> of the container <b>110</b>. As another example, the flexible skirt <b>224</b> may have a downward curvature in its un-deformed state. Further details regarding example shapes of the flexible skirt <b>224</b> are illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>10</b>A-<b>10</b>D</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0078" num="0077">In its un-deformed state (shown in the broken lines in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b>B</figref>), the flexible skirt <b>224</b> may curve upwards or downwards by any amount that allows it to contact (and/or press against) the internal surface <b>130</b><i>b </i>of the sidewall <b>130</b>. For example, the curve may create an arc that has a central angle <b>228</b> (shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref>) of or of substantially (e.g., +/&#x2212;10%) 45 degrees, 50 degrees, 60 degrees, 70 degrees, 75 degrees, 80 degrees, 90 degrees, 100 degrees, 110 degrees, 120 degrees 130 degrees, 135 degrees, 140 degrees, 150 degrees, any other angle that allows the flexible skirt <b>224</b> to contact (and/or press against) the internal surface <b>130</b><i>b </i>of the sidewall <b>130</b>, or any angle (or range of angles) in-between 45 degrees and 150 degrees.</p>
<p id="p-0079" num="0078">The lid <b>200</b> further includes a lid rim <b>250</b>. The lid rim <b>250</b> may be any device, element, or unit that may be coupled to the gasket <b>220</b> and/or the central portion <b>210</b> to as to provide an outer surface or edge to the gasket <b>220</b>, central portion <b>210</b>, and/or the lid <b>200</b>. As is illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b>B</figref>, the lid rim <b>250</b> may extend around the upper portion <b>221</b> of the gasket <b>220</b>. For example, a top surface <b>250</b><i>b </i>of the lid rim <b>250</b> may be positioned on a top surface <b>221</b><i>b </i>of the upper portion <b>221</b>, a bottom surface <b>250</b><i>c </i>of the lid rim <b>250</b> may be positioned on a bottom surface <b>221</b><i>c </i>of the upper portion <b>221</b>, and an external edge <b>250</b><i>a </i>of the lid rim <b>250</b> may be poisoned on the external edge <b>221</b><i>a </i>of the upper portion <b>221</b>. This may cause the lid rim <b>250</b> to surround all or a portion of the exterior surface of the upper portion <b>221</b> of the gasket <b>220</b>. The external edge <b>250</b><i>a </i>of the lid rim <b>250</b> may define the horizontally outermost portion of the lid rim <b>250</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0080" num="0079">The lid rim <b>250</b> may apply pressure to portions of the lid <b>200</b>. For example, the lid rim <b>250</b> may apply a substantially downward pressure on the top surface <b>221</b><i>b </i>of the upper portion <b>221</b> (and further on a top side of the outer peripheral region <b>210</b><i>a </i>of the central portion <b>210</b>), and may further apply a substantially upward pressure on the bottom surface <b>221</b><i>c </i>of the upper portion <b>221</b> (and further on a bottom side of the outer peripheral region <b>210</b><i>a </i>of the central portion <b>210</b>), in some examples. This may assist in coupling the gasket <b>220</b> to the central portion <b>210</b> by, for example, further squeezing or clamping the upper portion <b>221</b> (and the inner groove <b>222</b> in the upper portion <b>221</b>) onto the outer peripheral region <b>210</b><i>a </i>of the central portion <b>210</b>. As another example, the lid rim <b>250</b> may apply a substantially horizontal pressure on the external edge <b>221</b><i>a </i>of the upper portion <b>221</b> of the gasket <b>220</b>, so as to squeeze (or otherwise apply pressure to) opposing sides of the external edge <b>221</b><i>a </i>together (e.g., and squeeze them against the central portion <b>210</b> positioned in-between the opposing sides). This may urge the inner groove <b>222</b> in the upper portion <b>221</b> into a further sealed engagement with the outer peripheral region <b>210</b><i>a </i>of the central portion <b>210</b> (and/or vice versa, by urging outer peripheral region <b>210</b><i>a </i>of the central portion <b>210</b> into a further sealed engagement with the inner groove <b>222</b> in the upper portion <b>221</b>). For example, it may urge the outer peripheral region <b>210</b><i>a </i>of the central portion <b>210</b> further into position within the inner groove <b>222</b> of the upper portion <b>211</b> (e.g., by further pressing the outermost horizontal edge of the inner groove <b>222</b> against the outside perimeter of the outer peripheral region <b>210</b><i>a </i>of the central portion <b>210</b>),</p>
<p id="p-0081" num="0080">The lid rim <b>250</b> may provide support to the gasket <b>220</b>, in some examples. For example, the lid rim <b>250</b> may stiffen the material(s) of the gasket <b>220</b> in the proximity of the lid rim <b>250</b>. As an example of this, the lid rim <b>250</b> may squeeze portions of the upper portion <b>221</b>, causing the upper portion <b>221</b> to stiffen (as it is bunched together by the lid rim <b>250</b>). This may allow the gasket <b>220</b> to be made of a very soft and pliable material (to enhance the deformability of the flexible skirt <b>224</b>), while also allowing the upper portion <b>221</b> to be sufficiently hard and less pliable so as to prevent the gasket <b>220</b> (and the lid <b>200</b>) from being pushed entirely within the fluid retaining interior region <b>190</b> of the container <b>110</b> when the lid <b>200</b> is positioned tightly on the container <b>110</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0082" num="0081">The lid rim <b>250</b> may be made of any material(s) that may allow the food storage or cooking vessel <b>100</b> to be used to hold, store, and/or cook a food item. For example, the lid rim <b>250</b> may be made of any material(s) that may allow the food storage or cooking vessel <b>100</b> to be positioned within a microwave oven while the microwave oven is heating the food item held in the container <b>110</b> of the food storage or cooking vessel <b>100</b>. As an example of this, the lid rim <b>250</b> may be made of plastic, glass, pottery materials, non-metallic materials, metallic materials, any other material that may allow the food storage or cooking vessel <b>100</b> to be used to hold, store, and/or cook a food item, or any combination of the preceding. In a preferable example, the lid rim <b>250</b> is made of metal or stainless steel. The use of a lid rim <b>250</b> being made of a thin curved metal sheet (or other metal member) may allow the food storage or cooking vessel <b>100</b> to be heated in the microwave oven, as it may prevent arcing in a microwave oven, in some examples.</p>
<p id="p-0083" num="0082">Furthermore, in a preferable example, the material of the lid rim <b>250</b> may be a smooth material, such as metal. As such, when the gasket <b>220</b> is in contact with the internal surface <b>130</b><i>b </i>of the sidewall <b>130</b> (thereby providing a seal), the contact of the smooth material (e.g., metal) of the bottom surface <b>250</b><i>c </i>of the lid rim <b>250</b> with the rim <b>140</b> of the container <b>110</b> (e.g., made of glass) may provide additional sealing, in some examples. Furthermore, it may also render the sealed food storage or cooking vessel <b>100</b> generally air tight for the food storage or cooking of foods in cabinets or in refrigerators.</p>
<p id="p-0084" num="0083">The lid rim <b>250</b> may have any size and/or shape. For example, as is discussed above, the lid rim <b>250</b> may be a thin sheet of metal that may, in some examples, be sized to surround all or a portion of the exterior surface of the upper portion <b>221</b> of the gasket <b>220</b>. In some examples, the lid rim <b>250</b> may have a thickness (or other dimension) that causes the external edge <b>250</b><i>a </i>of the lid rim <b>250</b> to extend horizontally outward past the internal surface <b>130</b><i>b </i>of the sidewall <b>130</b>. In other examples, the lid rim <b>250</b> may have a thickness (or other dimension) that causes the external edge <b>250</b><i>a </i>of the lid rim <b>250</b> to extend horizontally outward past the external surface <b>130</b><i>a </i>of the sidewall <b>130</b>. By extending horizontally outward past the internal surface <b>130</b><i>b </i>and/or the external surface <b>130</b><i>a</i>, the size of the lid rim <b>250</b> may assist in preventing the gasket <b>220</b> (and lid <b>200</b>) from being pushed entirely within the fluid retaining interior region <b>190</b> of the container <b>110</b>. Hence, when the lid <b>200</b> is placed in the opening <b>150</b> to close or seal the container <b>110</b> and food storage or cooking vessel <b>100</b>, the lid rim <b>250</b> may extend beyond the first rim <b>140</b> to limit the vertical displacement of the gasket <b>220</b> into the upper opening <b>150</b> such that the flexible skirt <b>224</b> sealingly engages the internal surface <b>130</b><i>b </i>of the sidewall <b>130</b>. This limit on vertical displacement of the gasket <b>220</b> may cause a portion of the gasket <b>220</b> (e.g., the upper portion <b>221</b>, a portion of the upper portion <b>221</b>) to remain vertically above the rim <b>140</b> of the container <b>110</b> even when the lid <b>200</b> is sealing the food storage or cooking vessel <b>100</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0085" num="0084">The lid rim <b>250</b> may be ring-shaped (i.e., annular), allowing the lid rim <b>250</b> to surround the upper portion <b>221</b> of the gasket <b>220</b> along the entire horizontal perimeter (i.e., the entire external edge <b>221</b><i>a </i>of the upper portion <b>221</b> of the gasket <b>220</b>). Furthermore, the annular shape of the lid rim <b>250</b> is not limited to a circle. Instead, the annular shape may include an annular circle, oval, square, rectangle, diamond, irregular shape, any other shape, or any combination of the preceding. Furthermore, the annular shape may include one or more elliptical segments, curvilinear segments, non-curvilinear segments, a combination of curvilinear and non-curvilinear segments, or any combination of the preceding. This may allow the lid rim <b>250</b> to fit any shaped gasket <b>220</b> and container <b>110</b>, such as an oval gasket <b>220</b> and container <b>110</b> or a gasket <b>220</b> and container <b>110</b> with a straight sides and rounded corners. As is illustrated, the lid rim <b>250</b>, the gasket <b>220</b>, the central portion <b>210</b>, the lid <b>200</b>, and the container <b>110</b> are shaped as a circle. Notwithstanding the alternative shapes of the lid <b>200</b> and lid rim <b>250</b>, when the lid rim <b>250</b> is made of metal and the container <b>110</b> is intended for use in a microwave oven, the lid rim <b>250</b> should not have any sharp corners, but should have a radius of curvature greater than several millimeters, but more preferably at least a centimeter or several centimeters.</p>
<p id="p-0086" num="0085">The lid rim <b>250</b> may include an upper inner periphery <b>251</b> that extends horizontally inward past the top surface <b>221</b><i>b </i>of the upper portion <b>221</b> (towards the central portion <b>210</b>), and that also extends downward so as to contact the central portion <b>210</b>. This may minimize the potential for entry of contamination in the inner groove <b>222</b> of the gasket <b>220</b>, in some examples. In a preferable example, the upper inner periphery <b>251</b> is folded over itself, as is illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>1</b>B and <b>2</b></figref>. This may cause the curved portion of the fold to be in contact with the central portion <b>210</b>, in some examples.</p>
<p id="p-0087" num="0086">Modifications, additions, and/or substitutions may be made to the food storage or cooking vessel <b>100</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>1</b>A-<b>2</b></figref> without departing from the scope of the specification. For example, although the lid <b>200</b> of the food storage or cooking vessel <b>100</b> is described above as including a lid rim <b>250</b>, in some examples, the lid <b>200</b> may not include a lid rim <b>250</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0088" num="0087"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>3</b>A-<b>3</b>C</figref> illustrate another example of the lid <b>200</b> of the food storage or cooking vessel <b>100</b>. The lid <b>200</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>3</b>A-<b>3</b>C</figref> may be substantially similar to the lid <b>200</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>1</b>A-<b>2</b></figref>. However, the gasket <b>220</b> of the lid <b>200</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>3</b>A-<b>3</b>C</figref> may further include one or more bumpers <b>260</b> and one or more apertures <b>229</b>. Also, the lid <b>200</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>3</b>A-<b>3</b>B</figref> may be positioned on (or otherwise used with) a container <b>110</b> that is substantially similar to the container <b>110</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>1</b>A-<b>2</b></figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0089" num="0088">As is illustrated, the gasket <b>220</b> may include one or more bumpers <b>260</b>. The bumper <b>260</b> may assist in centering the lid <b>200</b> on the container <b>110</b>. For example, as the lid <b>200</b> is being positioned on the container <b>110</b>, the bumper(s) <b>260</b> may bump or rub against the internal surface <b>130</b><i>b </i>of the sidewall <b>130</b> of the container <b>110</b>. This bumping or rubbing of the bumpers <b>260</b> on opposing sides the internal surface <b>130</b><i>b </i>of the sidewall <b>130</b> may signify to the user that the lid <b>200</b> is properly centered on the container <b>110</b>. As such, using guidance provided by the bumpers <b>260</b>, the user may be able to more easily move the lid <b>200</b> downward with the central portion <b>210</b> in a plane that is parallel to the plan defined by the rim <b>140</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0090" num="0089">In some examples, the bumper(s) <b>260</b> may be helpful because the flexible skirt <b>224</b>'s flexible nature may prevent it from properly signaling to the user that the lid <b>200</b> is properly centered on the container <b>110</b>. Instead, without the bumpers <b>260</b>, the user may have improperly positioned the lid <b>200</b> in a location that causes a first portion of the flexible skirt <b>224</b> to be too close to the internal surface <b>130</b><i>b</i>, while an opposing portion of the flexible skirt <b>224</b> is too far from the internal surface <b>130</b><i>b </i>(thereby providing an ineffective seal).</p>
<p id="p-0091" num="0090">The bumper <b>260</b> may be any structure positioned on the gasket <b>220</b> that may assist in centering the lid <b>200</b> on the container <b>110</b>. For example, the bumper <b>260</b> may be bump (or other piece of material) in the profile of the gasket <b>220</b>, a lip protruding downward from the upper portion <b>221</b> of the gasket <b>220</b>, any other structure positioned on the gasket <b>220</b> that may assist in centering the lid <b>200</b> on the container <b>110</b>, or any combination of the preceding. As is illustrated, the bump <b>260</b> is a bump (or other piece of material) in the profile of the gasket <b>220</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0092" num="0091">The bumper <b>260</b> may be positioned on any portion of the gasket <b>220</b> that allows it to assist in centering the lid <b>200</b> on the container <b>110</b>. For example, the bumper <b>260</b> may be positioned on the upper portion <b>221</b> of the gasket <b>220</b> (e.g., as a lip that extends downward from the bottom surface <b>221</b><i>c </i>of the upper portion <b>221</b>), positioned on the vertical portion <b>223</b> of the gasket <b>220</b> (e.g., a bump that extends horizontally outward from the outer side <b>223</b><i>a </i>of the vertical portion <b>223</b>), positioned on both the upper portion <b>221</b> and the vertical portion <b>223</b> of the gasket <b>220</b> (e.g., a bump that extends downward from the bottom surface <b>221</b><i>c </i>and that further extends horizontally outward from the outer side <b>223</b><i>a </i>of the vertical portion <b>223</b>, as is illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>3</b>A-<b>3</b>C</figref>), positioned on any other portion of the gasket <b>220</b> that allows the bumper <b>260</b> to assist in centering the lid <b>200</b> on the container <b>110</b>, or any combination of the preceding.</p>
<p id="p-0093" num="0092">The bumper <b>260</b> may have any size and/or shape (and/or positioning) that allows it to assist in centering the lid <b>200</b> on the container <b>110</b>. For example, the bumper <b>260</b> may be sized so that its horizontally outermost surface is located inward (or is inset) from the external edge <b>221</b><i>a </i>of the upper portion <b>221</b> of the gasket <b>220</b>. This location of the horizontally outermost surface may allow the bumper <b>260</b> to fit within the fluid retaining interior region <b>190</b> of the container <b>110</b>, while the upper portion <b>221</b> or a portion of the upper portion <b>221</b> remains outside of the fluid retaining interior region <b>190</b> of the container <b>110</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0094" num="0093">As another example, the bumper <b>260</b> may be sized so that its horizontally outermost surface is located inward (or is inset) from the horizontally outermost portion of the flexible skirt <b>224</b>. This may allow the bumper <b>260</b> to assist in centering the lid <b>200</b> on the container <b>110</b>, without the bumper <b>260</b> being configured to flex upward and downward (as the lid <b>200</b> is positioned on the container <b>110</b>). As another example, the bumper <b>260</b> may be sized so that (when the lid <b>200</b> is positioned on the container <b>100</b>) the bumper <b>260</b>'s horizontally outermost surface is located at or slightly inward of the internal surface <b>130</b><i>b </i>of the sidewall <b>130</b>. In some examples, the horizontal distance between the horizontally outermost surface of the bumper <b>260</b> and the internal surface <b>130</b><i>b </i>of the sidewall (when the lid <b>200</b> is positioned on the container <b>110</b> to seal the food storage or cooking vessel <b>100</b>) may be or may be substantially (e.g., +/&#x2212;10%), for example, 0 millimeters, 0.1 millimeters, 0.25 millimeters, 0.5 millimeters, 1 millimeter, 1.5 millimeters, 2 millimeters, any other distance that allows the bumper <b>260</b> to assist in centering the lid <b>200</b> on the container <b>110</b>, or any distance (or range of distances) in-between 0 millimeters and 2 millimeters.</p>
<p id="p-0095" num="0094">The gasket <b>220</b> may include any number of bumpers <b>260</b>. For example, the gasket <b>220</b> may include 2 or more bumpers <b>260</b>, but preferably to 4 to 6 bumpers <b>260</b>. It may be desirable to have more than 6 bumpers depending on the circumference of the lid and rim, but a uniform radial spacing of between 30 to 90 degrees between bumpers <b>260</b> is sufficient to aid in centering, without unduly increasing molding complexity and the chance for manufacturing imperfections. The bumpers <b>260</b> may be spaced apart (e.g., radially spaced apart) from each other along the gasket <b>220</b>. For example, each bumper <b>260</b> may be spaced apart from any other bumper <b>260</b> along the outside perimeter of the gasket <b>220</b> (e.g., along the perimeter created by the external edge <b>221</b><i>a </i>of the upper portion <b>221</b>) by or substantially by (e.g., +/&#x2212;10%) 0.25 inches, 0.5 inches, 1 inch, 1.5 inches, 2 inches, 3 inches, 5 inches, or any distance (or range of distances) in-between 0.25 inches and 5 inches.</p>
<p id="p-0096" num="0095">As is also illustrated, the gasket <b>220</b> may include one or more apertures <b>229</b>. The aperture(s) <b>229</b> may allow air to vent out of the fluid retaining interior region <b>190</b> of the container <b>110</b> when the lid <b>200</b> is sealing the container <b>110</b> and the food storage or cooking vessel <b>100</b>. For example, the aperture(s) <b>229</b> may vent air out of the container <b>110</b> through one or more locations positioned in-between the vertical portion <b>223</b> of the gasket <b>220</b> and the internal surface <b>130</b><i>b </i>of the sidewall. This may allow the food storage or cooking vessel <b>100</b> to be more securely sealed because the venting may prevent air from being trapped and compressed in the fluid retaining interior region <b>190</b> during the lid closing process. This may be helpful, as compressed air in the fluid retaining interior region <b>190</b> could urge the lid <b>200</b> upward and could slowly defeat the sealing provide by the gasket <b>220</b>, in some examples.</p>
<p id="p-0097" num="0096">Furthermore, when the food storage or cooking vessel <b>100</b> is heated in a microwave oven, the steam and/or hot air generated may gradually vent through the aperture(s) <b>229</b> (and may vent to and/or through the location where the lid rim <b>250</b> contacts the rim <b>140</b> of the container <b>110</b>). This venting of the steam and/or hot air may prevent the lid <b>200</b> from being explosively ejected from the top of the container <b>110</b>, in some examples.</p>
<p id="p-0098" num="0097">The aperture <b>229</b> may be any venting structure positioned on the gasket <b>220</b> that may allow air to vent out of the fluid retaining interior region <b>190</b> when the lid <b>200</b> is positioned on the container <b>110</b> (thereby sealing the food storage or cooking vessel <b>100</b>). For example, as is illustrated, the aperture <b>229</b> may be a hole (or other aperture) in the gasket <b>220</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0099" num="0098">The aperture <b>229</b> may be positioned on any portion of the gasket <b>220</b> that allows it to allow air to vent out of the fluid retaining interior region <b>190</b> of the container <b>110</b> when the lid <b>200</b> is sealing the food storage or cooking vessel <b>100</b>. For example, the aperture <b>229</b> may be positioned in the vertical portion <b>223</b>, in the flexible skirt <b>224</b>, any other portion of the gasket <b>220</b> that allows it to allow air to vent out of the fluid retaining interior region <b>190</b> of the container <b>110</b> when the lid <b>200</b> is sealing the food storage or cooking vessel <b>100</b>, or any combination of the preceding. As is illustrated, the aperture <b>229</b> is positioned in the flexible skirt <b>224</b>. In some examples, the aperture <b>229</b> may be positioned in the flexible skirt <b>224</b> in a location adjacent (e.g., within or substantially within 0.5 inches, 0.3 inches, 0.1 inches, 2 millimeters) of the location where the flexible skirt <b>224</b> connects to the outer side <b>223</b><i>a </i>of the vertical portion <b>223</b>. Such positioning may prevent the aperture <b>229</b> from being blocked or obstructed by the flexible skirt <b>224</b> when it is moved upward by the internal surface <b>130</b><i>b </i>of the sidewall <b>130</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0100" num="0099">The aperture <b>229</b> may have any size and/or shape for allowing air to vent out of the fluid retaining interior region <b>190</b> of the container <b>110</b> when the lid <b>200</b> is sealing the food storage or cooking vessel <b>100</b>. For example, the aperture <b>229</b> may be shaped as a circle, an oval, a square, a rectangle, a diamond, an irregular shape, any other shape, or any combination of the preceding. As another example, the aperture <b>229</b> may have a diameter of or substantially (e.g., +/&#x2212;10%) 1 millimeter to generally less than about 5 millimeters. The larger the apertures <b>229</b>, the more easily fluid can leak through them. While no physical apertures can be fluid tight, capillary forces minimize fluid leakage when the apertures are smaller rather than larger.</p>
<p id="p-0101" num="0100">The aperture <b>229</b> may be formed in any manner on the gasket <b>220</b> for allowing air to vent out of the fluid retaining interior region <b>190</b> of the container <b>110</b> when the lid <b>200</b> is sealing the food storage or cooking vessel <b>100</b>. For example, the aperture <b>229</b> may be formed integral with the gasket <b>220</b>. In such an example, a mold used to form the gasket <b>220</b> may include protrusions that also form the aperture(s) <b>229</b>. As another example, the aperture <b>229</b> may be formed subsequent to the forming of the gasket <b>200</b>. In such an example, the apertures <b>229</b> may be poked through the thickness in the gasket <b>200</b> by, for example, a machine.</p>
<p id="p-0102" num="0101">The gasket <b>220</b> may include any number of apertures <b>229</b>. For example, the gasket <b>220</b> may preferably include from about 2 to 8 apertures <b>229</b>, but more or less apertures <b>229</b> can be deployed depending on aperture size so that steam or hot air can flow outward during microwave cooking to minimize the build of internal pressure. If the apertures <b>229</b> can be reproducibly made smaller than 1 mm, many more can be used, with the intent to provide the same effective cross section for hot gas or steam to escape. Other embodiments discussed further on do not require apertures <b>229</b>. The apertures <b>229</b> may be spaced apart (e.g., tangentially spaced apart) from each other along the gasket <b>220</b>. For example, each aperture <b>229</b> may be spaced apart from any other aperture <b>229</b> along the perimeter created by the flexible skirt <b>224</b> by or substantially by (e.g., +/&#x2212;10%) 1 millimeter, 2 millimeters, 0.1 inch, 0.25 inches, 0.5 inches, 1 inch, 1.5 inches, 2 inches, 3 inches, 5 inches, or any distance (or range of distances) in-between 1 millimeter and 5 inches.</p>
<p id="p-0103" num="0102">Modifications, additions, and/or substitutions may be made to the lid <b>200</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>3</b>A-<b>3</b>C</figref> without departing from the scope of the specification. For example, although the lid <b>200</b> is described above as including both bumper(s) <b>260</b> and aperture(s) <b>229</b>, the lid <b>200</b> may include only bumper(s) <b>260</b>, only aperture(s) <b>229</b>, or neither bumper(s) <b>260</b> nor aperture(s) <b>229</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0104" num="0103"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>4</b>A-<b>4</b>B</figref> illustrate another example of the container <b>110</b> and the lid <b>200</b> of the food storage or cooking vessel <b>100</b>. The container <b>110</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>4</b>A-<b>4</b>B</figref> may be substantially similar to the container <b>110</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>1</b>A-<b>2</b></figref> and/or <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>3</b>A-<b>3</b>C</figref>. However, the container <b>110</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>4</b>A-<b>4</b>B</figref> may further include one or more indentations <b>131</b>. The lid <b>200</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>4</b>A-<b>4</b>B</figref> may be substantially similar to the lid <b>200</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>1</b>A-<b>2</b></figref> and/or <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>3</b>A-<b>3</b>C</figref>. However, the lid rim <b>250</b> of the lid <b>200</b> may have a different shape. This shape of the lid rim <b>250</b> and the indentation(s) <b>131</b> may facilitate the removal of the lid <b>200</b> from the container <b>110</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0105" num="0104">As is illustrated, the external surface <b>130</b><i>a </i>of the sidewall <b>130</b> of the container <b>110</b> may include one or more indentations <b>131</b> that extend upward to the rim <b>140</b> of the container <b>110</b>. The indentation(s) <b>131</b> may provide a space into which a user may insert one or more fingers (or fingertips or other objects), so that the fingers (or other objects) may be positioned underneath a portion of the lid rim <b>250</b>. This positioning may allow the user to more easily urge the lid frame <b>250</b> upward and more easily release the gasket <b>220</b> from its sealed engagement with the internal surface <b>130</b><i>b </i>of the sidewall <b>130</b> of the container <b>110</b>, thereby opening the food storage or cooking vessel <b>100</b>. The contents of the container <b>110</b> may then be poured out of (or otherwise removed) from the container <b>110</b> through the upper opening <b>150</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0106" num="0105">The indentation <b>131</b> may have any size and/or shape (and/or positioning) that provides a space into which a user may insert one or more fingers (or fingertips or other objects). For example, the indentation <b>131</b> may have a depth that causes the external edge <b>250</b><i>a </i>of the lid rim <b>250</b> to extend horizontally outward past the external surface <b>130</b><i>a </i>(with the indentation <b>131</b>) of the sidewall <b>130</b> by or substantially by (e.g., +/&#x2212;10%) 2 millimeters, 0.1 inch, 0.2 inches, 0.25 inches, 0.3 inches, 0.4 inches, 0.5 inches, 0.6 inches, 0.75 inches, 0.8 inches, 0.9 inches, 1 inch, 1.5 inches, or any distance (or range of distances) in-between 2 millimeters and 1.5 inches. As another example, the indentation <b>131</b> may have a width (or length) along the perimeter of the external surface <b>130</b><i>a </i>that allows one or more fingers (e.g., one finger, two fingers, four fingers) to fit in the indentation <b>131</b>. As an example of this, the indentation <b>131</b> may have a width (or length) along the perimeter of the external surface <b>130</b><i>a </i>of or substantially of (e.g., +/&#x2212;10%) 0.5 inches, 1 inch, 1.5 inches, 2 inches, 2.5 inches, 3 inches, 3.5 inches, 4 inches, 5 inches, the entire perimeter of the external surface <b>130</b><i>a</i>, or any distance (or range of distances) in-between 0.5 inches and the entire perimeter of the external surface <b>130</b><i>a</i>. As is illustrated, the external surface <b>130</b><i>a </i>of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>4</b>A-<b>4</b>B</figref> includes a single indentation <b>131</b> that extends around the entire perimeter of the external surface <b>130</b><i>a </i>(i.e., it has a width equal to the entire perimeter of the external surface <b>130</b><i>a</i>).</p>
<p id="p-0107" num="0106">The external surface <b>130</b><i>a </i>may include any number of indentations <b>131</b>. For example, the external surface <b>130</b><i>a </i>may include 1 indentation <b>131</b>, 2 indentations <b>131</b>, 3 indentations <b>131</b>, 4 indentations <b>131</b>, 8 indentations <b>131</b>, 10 indentations <b>131</b>, 20 indentations <b>131</b>, any other number of indentations <b>131</b>, or any number of indentations <b>131</b> (or range of indentations <b>131</b>) in-between 1 indentation <b>131</b> and 20 indentations <b>131</b>. As is illustrated, the external surface <b>130</b><i>a </i>of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>4</b>A-<b>4</b>B</figref> includes a single indentation <b>131</b> that extends around the entire perimeter of the external surface <b>130</b><i>a. </i></p>
<p id="p-0108" num="0107">When the external surface <b>130</b><i>a </i>includes multiple indentations <b>131</b> (e.g., four indentations <b>131</b>, with one indentation <b>131</b> on each side of a square container <b>110</b>), the indentations <b>131</b> may be spaced apart from each other along the external surface <b>130</b><i>a</i>. For example, each indentation <b>131</b> may be spaced apart from any other indentations <b>131</b> along the perimeter of the external surface <b>130</b><i>a </i>by or substantially by (e.g., +/&#x2212;10%) 0.5 inches, 1 inch, 2 inches, 3 inches, 4 inches, 5 inches, 6 inches, 10 inches, or any distance (or range of distances) in-between 0.5 inches and 10 inches. In some examples, the external surface <b>130</b><i>a </i>may include one or more indentations <b>131</b> per side of the container <b>110</b>. For example, if the container <b>110</b> is square (or substantially square), the external surface <b>130</b><i>a </i>may include a single indentation <b>131</b> per side of the square (for a total of 4 indentations <b>131</b>). These indentations <b>131</b> may be positioned in the center (or middle) of each side, for example.</p>
<p id="p-0109" num="0108">As is discussed above, the lid rim <b>250</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>4</b>A-<b>4</b>B</figref> may have a different shape than the lid rim <b>250</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>1</b>A-<b>3</b></figref>. As is illustrated, the lid rim <b>250</b> (e.g., a thin ring-shaped sheet of metal) may include the external edge <b>250</b><i>a </i>positioned on (or over) the external edge <b>221</b><i>a </i>of the upper portion <b>221</b> of the gasket <b>220</b>, the top surface <b>250</b><i>b </i>positioned on (or over) the top surface <b>221</b><i>b </i>of the upper portion <b>221</b> of the gasket <b>220</b>, and the bottom surface <b>250</b><i>c </i>positioned on (or over) the bottom surface <b>221</b><i>c </i>of the upper portion <b>221</b> of the gasket <b>220</b>. This may cause the lid rim <b>250</b> to surround all or a portion of the exterior surface of the upper portion <b>221</b> of the gasket <b>220</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0110" num="0109">Similar to the lid frame <b>250</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>1</b>A-<b>3</b></figref>, the top surface <b>250</b><i>b </i>of the lid frame <b>250</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>4</b>A-<b>4</b>B</figref> may include the upper inner periphery <b>251</b> that extends horizontally inward past the top surface <b>221</b><i>b </i>of the upper portion <b>221</b> (towards the central portion <b>210</b>), and that also extends downward so as to contact the central portion <b>210</b>. The upper inner periphery <b>251</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>4</b>A-<b>4</b>B</figref> may be loosely folded over itself to provide a rounded upper edge <b>254</b>. This rounded upper edge <b>254</b> may approach and contact the central portion <b>210</b>. Furthermore, the rounded upper edge <b>254</b> may further cause the entire top surface <b>250</b><i>b </i>to have a rounded profile. In some examples, this rounded profile may cause a portion of the top surface <b>250</b><i>b </i>to extend over the top surface <b>221</b><i>b </i>of the upper portion <b>221</b> of the gasket <b>220</b>, without always being in contact with it.

All or a portion of this rounded lower edge <b>252</b> may extend horizontally outward past the external surface <b>130</b><i>a </i>in the location of an indentation <b>131</b>, as is illustrated. By extending past the external surface <b>130</b><i>a</i>, the lid frame <b>250</b> may have a more comfortable rounded edge that can be used by a user to lift the lid <b>200</b> off the container <b>110</b>. In some examples, this rounded lower edge <b>252</b> may cause a portion of the bottom surface <b>250</b><i>c </i>to extend over the bottom surface <b>221</b><i>c </i>of the upper portion <b>221</b> of the gasket <b>220</b>, without always being in contact with it.

<p id="p-0116" num="0115">The valve(s) <b>300</b> may allow the food storage or cooking vessel <b>100</b> to be more securely sealed because the venting may prevent air from being trapped and compressed in the fluid retaining interior region <b>190</b> during the lid closing process. For example, if the valve <b>300</b> is open (i.e., venting air) when the food storage or cooking vessel <b>100</b> is being sealed, the lid <b>200</b> can be urged downward as air in the container <b>110</b> is vented through the valve <b>300</b>. This may be helpful, as compressed air in the fluid retaining interior region <b>190</b> could prevent the food storage or cooking vessel <b>100</b> from being sealed at all, or could urge the lid <b>200</b> upward and slowly defeat the sealing provide by the gasket <b>220</b>, in some examples. As such, this venting by the valve(s) <b>300</b> may allow the flexible skirt <b>224</b> of the gasket <b>220</b> to seal with the internal surface <b>130</b><i>b </i>of the sidewall <b>130</b> (below the rim <b>140</b>). Also, after the lid <b>200</b> is positioned on the container <b>110</b>, and the food storage or cooking vessel <b>100</b> is fully sealed, the valve <b>300</b> may then be closed. Furthermore, when the food storage or cooking vessel <b>100</b> is heated in a microwave oven with the valve(s) <b>300</b> open, the steam and/or hot air generated will gradually vent through the valve(s) <b>300</b>. This venting of the steam and/or hot air may prevent the lid <b>200</b> from being explosively ejected from the top of the container <b>110</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0117" num="0116">In some examples, the use of valve(s) <b>300</b> in the lid <b>200</b> may allow air to be vented even when the gasket <b>220</b> does not include any apertures <b>229</b>. As such, the valve(s) <b>300</b> may be included in the food storage or cooking vessel <b>100</b> without any apertures <b>229</b>. In other examples, both the valve(s) <b>300</b> and the aperture(s) <b>229</b> may be included in the food storage or cooking vessel <b>100</b>. In some examples, if the lid <b>200</b> does not include either aperture(s) <b>229</b> or valve(s) <b>300</b> (or if the valves <b>300</b> are closed), the compression of trapped air may prevent the sealing of the food storage or cooking vessel <b>100</b>, as the compression of trapped air may resist the full insertion of the flexible skirt <b>224</b> below the rim <b>140</b> of the container <b>110</b>. In other examples, the food storage or cooking vessel <b>100</b> may still be able to vent some of this air even if the food storage or cooking vessel <b>100</b> does not include aperture(s) <b>229</b> or valve(s) <b>300</b>. Furthermore, in other examples, the food storage or cooking vessel <b>100</b> may still be able to be properly sealed even if the food storage or cooking vessel <b>100</b> does not include aperture(s) <b>229</b> or valve(s) <b>300</b>. As such, the food storage or cooking vessel <b>100</b> may not include either aperture(s) <b>229</b> or valve(s) <b>300</b>, in some examples.</p>
<p id="p-0118" num="0117">As is illustrated, the food storage or cooking vessel <b>100</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>5</b>A-<b>9</b></figref> includes one or more valves <b>300</b>. The valve <b>300</b> may include any device, element, or unit that may selectively allow air to vent out of the fluid retaining interior region <b>190</b> through the central portion <b>210</b>, and that may also selectively prevent air from venting out of the fluid retaining interior region <b>190</b> through the central portion <b>210</b>. For example, the valve <b>300</b> may be a hole and plug combination, a sliding gate valve, a diaphragm or membrane valve, any other device, element, or unit that may selectively allow air to vent out of the fluid retaining interior region <b>190</b> through the central portion <b>210</b> and that may also selectively prevent air from venting out of the fluid retaining interior region <b>190</b> through the central portion <b>210</b>, or any combination of the preceding. As is illustrated, the valve <b>300</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>5</b>A-<b>9</b></figref> is a hole and plug combination.</p>
<p id="p-0119" num="0118">According to the illustrated example, the valve <b>300</b> includes a hole <b>115</b> in the central portion <b>210</b>, and a plug <b>301</b>. The hole <b>115</b> may be any opening that extends through the entire thickness of the central portion <b>210</b>, so that air can pass through the central portion <b>210</b> through the hole <b>115</b>. The hole <b>115</b> may have any shape and/or size that allows the valve <b>300</b> to selectively allow air to vent out of the fluid retaining interior region <b>190</b> through the central portion <b>210</b>, and also to selectively prevent air from venting out of the fluid retaining interior region <b>190</b> through the central portion <b>210</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0120" num="0119">The plug <b>301</b> may be any device, element, or unit that may selectively plug (or otherwise close) the hole <b>115</b>. The plug <b>301</b> may be made of any material that allows it to selectively plug (or otherwise close) the hole <b>115</b>, thereby preventing air from passing through the central portion <b>210</b>. For example, the plug <b>301</b> may be made of rubber, a polymer, an elastomer (e.g., silicone, fluorosilicone, etc.), any other material that allows the plug <b>301</b> to selectively plug (or otherwise close) the hole <b>115</b> (thereby preventing air from passing through the central portion <b>210</b>), or any combination of the preceding. In a preferable example, the plug <b>301</b> is made of a soft resilient deformable material like silicone rubber.</p>
<p id="p-0121" num="0120">The plug <b>301</b> may have any size and/or shape that allows it to selectively plug (or otherwise close) the hole <b>115</b>. For example, as is illustrated, the plug <b>301</b> may have a central portion <b>302</b> positioned at least partially within the hole <b>115</b>, a top portion <b>303</b>, and bottom portion <b>304</b>. The top portion <b>303</b> may extend outside of the top of the hole <b>115</b>, and may have dimensions (e.g., width) that are larger than that of the hole <b>115</b>. A user may push down on this top portion <b>303</b> to move the plug <b>301</b> downward, and may pull upward on this top portion <b>303</b> to move the plug <b>301</b> upward. The bottom portion <b>304</b> may extend outside of the bottom of the hole <b>115</b>, and may have dimensions (e.g., width) that are larger than that of the hole <b>115</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0122" num="0121">The central portion <b>302</b> may include two regions: a top wide region <b>302</b><i>a </i>and a bottom narrow region <b>302</b><i>b</i>. The top wide region <b>302</b><i>a </i>may have a shape and/or size that is the same (or bigger than) the shape and/or size of the hole <b>115</b>. As such, when the top wide region <b>302</b><i>a </i>is positioned within (or aligned with) the hole <b>115</b> (e.g., when the plug <b>301</b> is moved downward so that that top wide region <b>302</b><i>a </i>is positioned within the sidewalls of the hole <b>115</b>, as is seen in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b>B</figref>), the top wide region <b>302</b><i>a </i>may at least substantially close the hole <b>115</b>, preventing air from passing through the valve <b>300</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0123" num="0122">The bottom narrow region <b>302</b><i>b </i>may have a shape and/or size that is different than and/or smaller than the shape and/or size of the hole <b>115</b>. As such, when the bottom narrow region <b>302</b><i>b </i>is positioned within (or aligned with) the hole <b>115</b> (e.g., when the plug <b>301</b> is moved upward so that that bottom narrow region <b>302</b><i>b </i>is positioned within the sidewalls of the hole <b>115</b>, as is seen in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b>A</figref>), an air passageway may be provided through the hole <b>115</b>, as is illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b>A</figref>. As an example of the shape and/or size of the bottom narrow region <b>302</b><i>b</i>, the bottom narrow region <b>302</b><i>b </i>may not be as wide as the hole <b>115</b> (but it may be as vertically thick or thicker than that of the hole <b>115</b>). As another example, the bottom narrow region <b>302</b><i>b </i>may be a different shape as the hole (e.g., the hole <b>115</b> may have a circular cross section but the bottom narrow region <b>302</b><i>b </i>may have a triangular cross section).</p>
<p id="p-0124" num="0123">When the valve <b>300</b> is open (e.g., when the plug <b>301</b> is pulled upward), air and vapor may exit the hole <b>115</b>, and external air may enter the hole <b>115</b> (which may release a vacuum within the fluid retaining interior region <b>190</b> of the container <b>110</b>). Alternatively, when the valve <b>300</b> is closed (e.g., when the plug <b>301</b> is pushed downward), air and vapor may be prevented from exiting the hole <b>115</b>, and external air may be prevented from entering the hole <b>115</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0125" num="0124">The valve <b>300</b> may further include an o-ring to seal and be in threaded engagement with the lid <b>200</b> via the perimeter of the hole <b>115</b>, or an insert therein (which is not shown), in some examples. Furthermore, although the valve <b>300</b> is illustrated as being open when the plug <b>301</b> is pulled upward, in some examples the valve <b>300</b> may be closed when the plug <b>301</b> is pulled upward (and may be open when the plug <b>301</b> is pushed downward). In such examples, the bottom narrow region <b>302</b><i>b </i>may be positioned vertically above the top wide region <b>302</b><i>a. </i></p>
<p id="p-0126" num="0125">In a preferred example, the valve <b>300</b> may further be able to provide one or more indications about the food held and/or stored in the food storage or cooking vessel <b>100</b>. For example, as is illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>6</b></figref>, the lid <b>200</b> may include one or more markings <b>290</b> that indicate an useful date for the food item held and/or stored in the food storage or cooking vessel <b>100</b> (e.g., an indication of the date when the food item was placed in the food storage or cooking vessel <b>100</b>, an indication of when the food item should be disposed of). As is illustrated, the markings <b>290</b> may run from 1 to 7 for seven days of the week, but can represent an indication of the weeks of a month, months of a year, or any other indication (e.g., food type, cooking style, etc.).</p>
<p id="p-0127" num="0126">In the example of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>6</b></figref>, the plug <b>301</b> may further include a shape or marking (e.g., a single outward pointing hole <b>306</b>) that may point to one of the markings <b>290</b> on the lid <b>200</b>. As such, if the outward pointing hole <b>306</b> points to the 4, it may indicate that the food item was put in the food storage or cooking vessel <b>100</b> on Wednesday (i.e., the 4<sup>th </sup>day of a week). This outward pointing hole <b>306</b> (or other shape or marking) may be rotated (e.g., clockwise, counterclockwise) to any of the markings <b>290</b>. To do so, the plug <b>301</b> may be rotated (by a user) within the hole <b>115</b>, without venting air. To assist in rotating the plug <b>301</b>, the plug <b>301</b> may have an outer region <b>305</b> with an upward curled edge <b>307</b> that may be gripped by the user. When the valve <b>300</b> is closed, the top portion <b>303</b> of the plug <b>301</b> may be generally flat in the central portion <b>210</b>. However, the upward curled edge <b>307</b> of the plug <b>301</b> may allow the user to easily grab and rotate the plug <b>301</b>, even when the valve <b>300</b> is closed. The plug <b>301</b> may have an upward extending portion for gripping, which like the gasket is preferably rubber or elastomer to facilitate gripping to release any vacuum therein, as well as to raise the lid for serving cooked or stored food.</p>
<p id="p-0128" num="0127">The central portion <b>210</b> may include any number of valves <b>300</b>. For example, the central portion <b>210</b> may include 1 valve <b>300</b>, 2 valves <b>300</b>, 3 valves <b>300</b>, 4 valves <b>300</b>, any other number of valves <b>300</b>, or any number of valves <b>300</b> (or range of valves <b>300</b>) in-between 1 valve <b>300</b> and 4 valves <b>300</b>. Furthermore, the valve(s) <b>300</b> may be positioned in any location in the central portion <b>210</b>. For example, the valve <b>300</b> may be positioned in the center of the central portion <b>210</b>, off-center in the central portion <b>210</b>, in a corner of the central portion <b>210</b>, any other location in the central portion <b>210</b>, or any combination of the preceding. As is illustrated, the central portion <b>210</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>5</b>A-<b>9</b></figref> includes a single valve <b>300</b> positioned in the center of the central portion <b>210</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0129" num="0128">In some examples, if the food item is already heated when it is positioned in the container <b>110</b> (e.g., for storage), the hot food item may generate steam and air that is expelled out of open valve(s) <b>300</b>. Furthermore, if the valve(s) <b>300</b> are closed, cooling of the hot food item in the container <b>110</b> (e.g., cooling in the refrigerator) may condense steam that is trapped in the food storage or cooking vessel <b>100</b>. This condensation may result in a vacuum within the container <b>110</b>, which may hold the lid <b>200</b> in place with greater force than just the frictional engagement of the gasket <b>220</b> and flexible skirt <b>224</b> with the container <b>110</b>. This manner of providing a vacuum in the container <b>110</b> may provide additional advantages, such as by providing protection of the food item therein from spilling (even if the container is inverted), improved storage life by excluding bacteria, and the avoidance of the transfer of food item odors to the refrigerator. Unfortunately, this manner of providing a vacuum could also cause issues, in some examples. For example, because atmospheric pressure on the lid <b>200</b> increases as the lid size increases, providing such a vacuum within a large vessel (having a large lid size) may also require a reinforced lid or a thicker lid (or a limitation on the diameter of the lid).</p>
<p id="p-0130" num="0129">The gasket <b>220</b> of the food storage or cooking vessel of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>5</b>A-<b>9</b></figref> (and/or of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>1</b>A-<b>2</b></figref>, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>3</b>A-<b>3</b>C</figref>, and/or <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>4</b>A-<b>4</b>B</figref>), however, may provide self-venting that may address this deficiency, in some examples. This self-venting may prevent the formation of too much of a vacuum within the container <b>110</b> (which may be problematic, as is discussed above). Furthermore, after the self-venting occurs, the valve <b>300</b> may be re-opened, the lid <b>100</b> may be removed and re-inserted (or just re-inserted), and the valve <b>300</b> may then be closed to maintain the lid <b>200</b> in the closed position.</p>
<p id="p-0131" num="0130">To provide this self-venting, the flexible skirt <b>224</b> may be further configured so that at least a portion of the flexible skirt <b>224</b> may flex (or otherwise move) downward as a result of inside and outside pressure. This flexibility may cause this portion of the flexible skirt <b>224</b> to deform downwards, as is illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>7</b>A-<b>7</b>C and <b>8</b></figref>. For example, when a vacuum forms in the container <b>110</b> (e.g., due to the cooling of a heated food item in the sealed food storage or cooking vessel <b>100</b>, as is discussed above), the higher atmospheric pressure outside of the food storage or cooking vessel <b>100</b> may cause a portion of a perimeter of the flexible skirt <b>224</b> to deform by flipping orientation and curling downward. This downward deformation may cause the outward facing portion <b>224</b><i>a </i>of the flexible skirt <b>224</b> to flip down and face inward, while causing the inward facing portion <b>224</b><i>b </i>of the flexible skirt <b>224</b> to flip down and face outward, as is seen in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>7</b>A-<b>7</b>C and <b>8</b></figref>. During this downward deformation, a small amount of air may enter the container <b>110</b> through a gap created by the downward deformation, for example. This movement of a small amount of air into the container <b>110</b> is referred to as self-venting. The self-venting may prevent a full vacuum from forming in the container <b>110</b>. In some examples, this self-venting may prevent the need for a reinforced lid or a thicker lid on larger containers <b>110</b> (or may prevent a limitation on the diameter of the lid).</p>
<p id="p-0132" num="0131">The flexible skirt <b>224</b> may provide this self-venting even though it may be slightly curved upward in its un-deformed state (as is illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>7</b>A</figref>, and also discussed above), and further even though it may also curl upwards into an upward deformed state when it contacts the internal surface <b>130</b><i>b </i>of the sidewall <b>130</b> (as is illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>7</b>A</figref>, and also discussed above). In such examples, the higher atmospheric pressure outside of the food storage or cooking vessel <b>100</b> (when the container <b>110</b> has developed a vacuum) may still cause a portion of a perimeter of the flexible skirt <b>224</b> to deform by flipping orientation and curling downward, for example.</p>
<p id="p-0133" num="0132">The flexible skirt <b>224</b> may be configured in any way so as to allow the portion of a perimeter of the flexible skirt <b>224</b> to deform by flipping orientation and curling downward. For example, the flexible skirt <b>224</b> may have any thickness (or other dimension) that allows such a downward deformation. As another example, the material of the gasket <b>220</b> and the flexible skirt <b>224</b> (e.g., a rubber, a polymer, an elastomer, as is discussed above) may allow (or contribute to allowing) such downward deformation.</p>
<p id="p-0134" num="0133">The portion of the perimeter of the flexible skirt <b>224</b> that deforms downward may be any portion of the perimeter of the flexible skirt <b>224</b>. For example, it may only be a small portion of the perimeter of the flexible skirt <b>224</b>, or it may be the entire perimeter of the flexible skirt <b>224</b>. Additionally, the portion of the flexible skirt <b>224</b> may deform downward at any pressure differential where the outside pressure exceeds that pressure inside of the food storage or cooking vessel <b>100</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0135" num="0134">Furthermore, although the portion of the perimeter of the flexible skirt <b>224</b> may deform downward, the remaining portion of the perimeter of the flexible skirt <b>224</b> may not. As such, the remaining portion of the perimeter of the flexible skirt <b>224</b> may remain in constant or near constant contact with the internal surface <b>130</b><i>b </i>of the sidewall <b>130</b> (e.g., due to the compliancy of the flexible skirt <b>224</b>). This means that the downward deformed portion may be bounded (i.e., providing a boundary) on both sides by a remaining portion that is in constant or near constant contact with the internal surface <b>130</b><i>b </i>of the sidewall <b>130</b>. This may provide a slow decrease in vacuum level as is illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>9</b></figref>, which shows the measured change in pressure over time as near boiling water cools to about 50&#xb0; C. As is seen, the pressure differential (between the outside pressure and the pressure in the food storage or cooking vessel <b>100</b> with the valve <b>300</b> closed and the gasket <b>200</b> sealing the lid <b>200</b> to the internal surface <b>130</b><i>b </i>of the sidewall <b>130</b>) may increase by approximately 0.09 bars within less than 2 minutes, as the steam that has displaced air in the food storage or cooking vessel <b>100</b> condenses and drops the internal pressure. However, as indicated by the time axis placement of arrow <b>901</b>, there is an initial almost instantaneous decrease of the pressure differential as the external pressure causes downward deformation of the flexible skirt <b>224</b>, causing it to flip so that the inward facing portion <b>224</b><i>b </i>is in contact with the internal surface <b>130</b><i>b </i>of the sidewall <b>130</b> (instead of the outward facing portion <b>224</b><i>a</i>). Thereafter, the small non-contacting regions of the flexible skirt <b>224</b> surrounding the downward deformed portion may cause a slow leak of air so that the food storage or cooking vessel <b>100</b> is back at atmospheric pressure in about 15 minutes.</p>
<p id="p-0136" num="0135">Modifications, additions, and/or substitutions may be made to the food storage or cooking vessel <b>100</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>5</b>A-<b>9</b></figref> without departing from the scope of the specification. For example, although the food storage or cooking vessel <b>100</b> is described above as including each of valve(s) <b>300</b>, marking(s) <b>290</b>, and a self-venting flexible skirt <b>224</b>, in some examples the food storage or cooking vessel <b>100</b> may include only valve(s) <b>300</b>, only marking(s) <b>290</b>, only a self-venting flexible skirt <b>224</b>, only two of the previous three features, or none of the previous three features.</p>
<p id="p-0137" num="0136"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>10</b>A-<b>10</b>D</figref> illustrate additional examples of gasket <b>220</b> of the food storage or cooking vessel <b>100</b>. The gaskets <b>220</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>10</b>A-<b>10</b>D</figref> may be substantially similar to the gaskets <b>220</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>1</b>A-<b>2</b></figref>, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>3</b>A-<b>3</b>C</figref>, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>4</b>A-<b>4</b>C</figref>, and/or <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>5</b>A-<b>9</b></figref>. However, the gaskets <b>220</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>10</b>A-<b>10</b>D</figref> may have a different shape. For example, the flexible skirt <b>224</b> of the gasket <b>220</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>10</b>A</figref> may include a rounded tip (as opposed to a flat tip). This rounded tip may allow the flexible skirt <b>224</b> to more easily deform downward, and may also allow the flexible skirt <b>224</b> to more easily flip back from the downward deformation after the pressure differential (between the outside pressure and the pressure inside the food storage or cooking vessel <b>100</b>) decreases. This may allow the gasket <b>220</b> to further seal the food storage or cooking vessel <b>100</b> following the decrease in pressure differential.</p>
<p id="p-0138" num="0137">As another example, the flexible skirt <b>224</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>10</b>B</figref> may have a downward curvature in its un-deformed state (as opposed to the upward curvature seen in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>1</b>A-<b>9</b></figref>). As a further example, the flexible skirt <b>224</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>10</b>C</figref> may not have a curvature at all. Instead, it may extend outward horizontally or substantially horizontally. It may also include a rounded tip. As another example, the flexible skirt <b>224</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>10</b>D</figref> may extend outward horizontally or substantially horizontally, and my further have a large rounded tip.</p>
<p id="p-0139" num="0138"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>11</b>A-<b>11</b>B</figref> illustrate another example of the container <b>110</b> and the lid <b>200</b> of the food storage or cooking vessel <b>100</b>, where the lid <b>200</b> includes another example of a valve <b>300</b>. The valve <b>300</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>11</b>A-<b>11</b>B</figref> may include a plug <b>301</b> having a top portion <b>303</b> that may be contracted into a more vertically compact shape (e.g., in response to a downward pressure on the top portion <b>303</b>) and may also expand back upwards out of the more vertically compact shape (e.g., in response to the downward pressure being removed). By contracting, a vertical dimension of the top portion <b>303</b> may be reduced, in some examples. This may allow multiple food storage or cooking vessels <b>100</b> to be stacked on top of each other. For example, when stacked, the weight of the top vessel <b>100</b> may press downward on the top portion <b>303</b> of valve <b>300</b> of the bottom vessel <b>100</b>, causing the top portion <b>303</b> to be urged downward so that the top portion <b>303</b> contracts into a more vertically compact shape. In such an example, the vessels <b>100</b> can be stacked on top of each other without the top portion <b>303</b> of the lid <b>200</b> getting in the way of the stacking. In some examples, the weight of the top vessel <b>100</b> (even if the vessel <b>100</b> is empty) with a lid <b>200</b> may be sufficient to urge the top portion <b>303</b> of the bottom vessel <b>100</b> downward so that the top portion <b>303</b> contracts into the more vertically compact shape. This may allow the vessels <b>100</b> to be stacked on top of each other, even when the vessels <b>100</b> are empty.</p>
<p id="p-0140" num="0139">The top portion <b>303</b> of the plug <b>301</b> may also expand upwards out of the more vertically compact shape (e.g., in response to the downward pressure being removed). By expanding upwards, the top portion <b>303</b> may move upwards away from the lid <b>200</b>, allowing it to be more easily gripped and/or handled by a user, in some examples. Furthermore, the vertical distance between the expanded top portion <b>303</b> and the lid <b>200</b> may prevent the user's hand from being burnt by heat emanating from the vessel <b>100</b> and/or from being burnt by hot steam escaping through the open valve <b>300</b>, in some examples.</p>
<p id="p-0141" num="0140">As is illustrated, the food storage or cooking vessel <b>100</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>11</b>A-<b>11</b>B</figref> includes the container <b>110</b>. The container <b>110</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>11</b>A-<b>11</b>B</figref> may be substantially similar to the container <b>110</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>1</b>A-<b>2</b></figref>, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>3</b>A-<b>3</b>C</figref>, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>4</b>A-<b>4</b>B</figref>, and/or <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>5</b>A-<b>9</b></figref>. Additionally, the bottom <b>120</b> of the container <b>110</b> may include a bottom central portion <b>404</b> and a bottom perimeter portion <b>408</b>. The bottom perimeter portion <b>408</b> may surround the bottom central portion <b>404</b>, and may further extend downward from the bottom central portion <b>404</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0142" num="0141">By extending downward from the bottom central portion <b>404</b>, the bottom perimeter portion <b>408</b> may create a vertical gap <b>412</b> in-between a bottom surface <b>404</b><i>a </i>of the bottom central portion <b>404</b> and a bottom surface <b>408</b><i>a </i>of the bottom perimeter portion <b>408</b>. This vertical gap <b>412</b> may form a space that prevents the bottom portion <b>404</b> from touching a flat surface when the bottom perimeter portion <b>408</b> is positioned on the flat surface. The vertical gap <b>412</b> may be any vertical distance, such as or substantially (e.g., +/&#x2212;10%) 2.5 millimeters, 5 millimeters, 7.5 millimeters, 10 millimeters, 15 millimeters, 20 millimeters, 1 inch, 1.5 inches, any other vertical distance, or any vertical distance (or range of vertical distances) in-between 2.5 millimeters and 1.5 inches.</p>
<p id="p-0143" num="0142">As is illustrated, the food storage or cooking vessel <b>100</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>11</b>A-<b>11</b>B</figref> further includes the lid <b>200</b>. The lid <b>200</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>11</b>A-<b>11</b>B</figref> may be substantially similar to the lid <b>200</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>1</b>A-<b>2</b></figref>, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>3</b>A-<b>3</b>C</figref>, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>4</b>A-<b>4</b>B</figref>, and/or <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>5</b>A-<b>9</b></figref>. Additionally, the central portion <b>210</b> of the lid <b>200</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>11</b>A-<b>11</b>B</figref> may include one or more valves <b>300</b> which may selectively allow air to vent out of the fluid retaining interior region <b>190</b> of the container <b>110</b> when the lid <b>200</b> is sealing the container <b>110</b> and the food storage or cooking vessel <b>100</b>. The valve <b>300</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>11</b>A-<b>11</b>B</figref> may be substantially similar to the valve <b>300</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>5</b>A-<b>9</b></figref>. However, the valve <b>300</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>11</b>A-<b>11</b>B</figref> may further include a plug <b>301</b> that has a top portion <b>303</b> that may be urged downward so as to contract into a more vertically compact shape, and that may also expand back upward out of the more vertically compact shape.</p>
<p id="p-0144" num="0143">According to the illustrated example, the valve <b>300</b> includes a hole <b>115</b> in the central portion <b>210</b>, and a plug <b>301</b>. The hole <b>115</b> may be any opening that extends through the entire thickness of the central portion <b>210</b>, so that air can pass through the central portion <b>210</b> through the hole <b>115</b>. The hole <b>115</b> may have any shape and/or size that allows the valve <b>300</b> to selectively allow air to vent out of the fluid retaining interior region <b>190</b> through the central portion <b>210</b>, and also to selectively prevent air from venting out of the fluid retaining interior region <b>190</b> through the central portion <b>210</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0145" num="0144">The plug <b>301</b> may be any device, element, or unit that may selectively plug (or otherwise close) the hole <b>115</b>. The plug <b>301</b> may be made of any material that allows it to selectively plug (or otherwise close) the hole <b>115</b>, thereby preventing air from passing through the central portion <b>210</b>. For example, the plug <b>301</b> may be made of rubber, a polymer, an elastomer (e.g., silicone, fluorosilicone, etc.), any other material that allows the plug <b>301</b> to selectively plug (or otherwise close) the hole <b>115</b> (thereby preventing air from passing through the central portion <b>210</b>), or any combination of the preceding. In a preferable example, all or a portion of the plug <b>301</b> is made of a soft resilient deformable material like silicone rubber.</p>
<p id="p-0146" num="0145">The plug <b>301</b> may have any size and/or shape that allows it to selectively plug (or otherwise close) the hole <b>115</b>. For example, as is illustrated, the plug <b>301</b> may have a central portion <b>302</b> positioned at least partially within the hole <b>115</b>, the top portion <b>303</b>, and a bottom portion <b>304</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0147" num="0146">The top portion <b>303</b> may extend outside of the top of the hole <b>115</b>, so as to extend vertically above a top surface (e.g., external surface <b>210</b><i>a</i>) of the central portion <b>210</b>. Furthermore, the top portion <b>303</b> may have dimensions (e.g., width) that are larger than that of the hole <b>115</b>. This may prevent the plug <b>301</b> from being pushed entirely down through the hole <b>115</b>, in some examples.</p>
<p id="p-0148" num="0147">The top portion <b>303</b> may be configured to be contracted (e.g., by a downward pressure) into a more vertically compact shape. In some examples, this may cause at least a top surface of the top portion <b>303</b> to be moved downward towards the top surface of the central portion <b>210</b> of the lid <b>200</b>. An example of the top portion <b>303</b> contracted into a more vertically compact shape is illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>11</b>B</figref> with regard to bottom vessel <b>100</b><i>b</i>. By contracting into a more vertically compact shape, a vertical dimension (e.g., height) of the top portion <b>303</b> may be reduced, in some examples. This may allow multiple food storage or cooking vessels <b>100</b> to be stacked on top of each other, as is illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>11</b>B</figref>. For example, when stacked, the weight of the top vessel <b>100</b> (e.g., vessel <b>100</b><i>a </i>of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>11</b>B</figref>) may press downward on the top portion <b>303</b> of the bottom vessel <b>100</b> (e.g., vessel <b>100</b><i>b </i>of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>11</b>B</figref>), causing the top portion <b>303</b> to contract into a more vertically compact shape. In such an example, the vessels <b>100</b> can be stacked on top of each other without the top portion <b>303</b> of the valve <b>300</b> of the bottom vessel <b>100</b> getting in the way of the stacking.</p>
<p id="p-0149" num="0148">When the top portion <b>303</b> is contracted, the top portion <b>303</b> may have a compact vertical dimension <b>416</b> (e.g., compact height), as is illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>11</b>B</figref>. This compact vertical dimension <b>416</b> may be less than the uncompact vertical dimension <b>420</b> of the top portion <b>303</b>, as is also illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>11</b>B</figref>. The compact vertical dimension <b>416</b> may be any height that is less than the height of uncompact vertical dimension <b>420</b>, such as or substantially (e.g., +/&#x2212;10%) 1 millimeter, 2 millimeters, 2.5 millimeters, 5 millimeters, 7.5 millimeters, 10 millimeters, 15 millimeters, 20 millimeters, 1 inch, 1.5 inches, any other height that is less than the height of uncompact vertical dimension <b>420</b>, or any height (or range of heights) in-between 1 millimeter and 1.5 inches.</p>
<p id="p-0150" num="0149">In some examples, the compact vertical dimension <b>416</b> may be a height that is equal to or less than the vertical distance of the vertical gap <b>412</b> in-between the bottom surface <b>404</b><i>a </i>of the bottom central portion <b>404</b> and the bottom surface <b>408</b><i>a </i>of the bottom perimeter portion <b>408</b>. In such examples, this may allow the top portion <b>303</b> to be contracted into a compact vertical dimension <b>416</b> that does not interfere with the stacking of vessels <b>100</b>. For example, when the top vessel <b>100</b><i>a </i>is stacked onto the bottom vessel <b>100</b><i>b </i>(as is illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>11</b>B</figref>), the bottom perimeter portion <b>408</b> of the top vessel <b>100</b><i>a </i>may be able to rest on the central portion <b>210</b> of the lid <b>200</b> of the bottom vessel <b>100</b><i>b</i>, and the top portion <b>303</b> of the valve <b>300</b> of the bottom vessel <b>100</b><i>b </i>may fit entirely within the vertical gap <b>412</b> of the top vessel <b>100</b><i>a</i>. This may allow the top vessel <b>100</b><i>a </i>to be more stable when stacked on top of the bottom vessel <b>100</b><i>b</i>, in some examples.</p>
<p id="p-0151" num="0150">The contraction of the top portion <b>303</b> into a more vertically compact shape may, in some examples, refer to a least a sub-portion of the top portion <b>303</b> being flexed, folded, or otherwise moved into a more vertically compact shape. That is, the entire top portion <b>303</b> may not be contracted into a more vertically compact shape, in some examples. Further examples of this are described below with regard to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>12</b>E</figref>. Also, the contraction into the more vertically compact shape is fully reversible in some examples, as it avoids plastic deformation of the top portion <b>303</b> so that the return to the expanded shape is an elastic recovery. In the expanded shape, a graspable section of the top portion <b>303</b> may extend sufficiently upward and away from the top surface of the central portion <b>210</b> of the lid <b>200</b>, such that the lid <b>200</b> need not be touched (e.g., in case it is uncomfortably hot).</p>
<p id="p-0152" num="0151">The top portion <b>303</b> may also be configured to expand back upwards out of the more vertically compact shape. (e.g., when the downward pressure is removed). In some examples, this may cause at least a top surface of the top portion <b>303</b> to move back upwards away from the top surface of the central portion <b>210</b> of the lid <b>200</b>. An example of the top portion <b>303</b> having expanded back upwards out of the more vertically compact shape is illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>11</b>B</figref> with regard to top vessel <b>100</b><i>a</i>. By expanding back upwards, a vertical dimension (e.g., height) of the top portion <b>303</b> may be increased, in some examples. This may allow the top portion <b>303</b> to be more easily gripped and/or handled by a user, in some examples. For example, by expanding upward, the top portion <b>303</b> may move away from the top surface of the lid <b>200</b> (e.g., a topmost surface of the top portion <b>303</b> may move away from the top surface of the lid <b>200</b>), which may provide additional space for the user to grip the top portion <b>303</b> (e.g., so as to pull upward, so as to rotate the plug <b>301</b>, so as to lift the entire lid <b>200</b> off of the container <b>110</b>), to grip an opening in the top portion <b>303</b> (as is discussed below), to grip the top portion <b>303</b> in any other manner, or to otherwise handle the top portion <b>303</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0153" num="0152">The increased vertical dimension (e.g., height) of the top portion <b>303</b> may further prevent the user's hand from being burnt by heat emanating from the vessel <b>100</b> and/or from being burnt by hot steam escaping through the open valve <b>300</b>, in some examples. For example, by expanding upward, the top portion <b>303</b> may move away from the top surface of the lid <b>200</b> (e.g., a topmost surface of the top portion <b>303</b> may move away from the top surface of the lid <b>200</b>), which may provide additional space. This additional space may allow the user to open the valve <b>300</b> (e.g., by pulling upward on the top portion <b>303</b> or otherwise moving the plug <b>301</b> upward), while keeping the user's hand further away from any hot steam escaping from the open valve <b>300</b>. As such, the valve <b>300</b> may be easier and/or safer to use, in some examples.</p>
<p id="p-0154" num="0153">When the top portion <b>303</b> expands back upwards, the top portion <b>303</b> may have an uncompact vertical dimension <b>420</b> (e.g., uncompact height), as is illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>11</b>B</figref>. This uncompact vertical dimension <b>420</b> may be greater than the compact vertical dimension <b>416</b> of the top portion <b>303</b>, as is also illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>11</b>B</figref>. The uncompact vertical dimension <b>420</b> may be any height that is greater than the height of compact vertical dimension <b>416</b>, such as or substantially (e.g., +/&#x2212;10%) 5 millimeters, 7.5 millimeters, 10 millimeters, 15 millimeters, 20 millimeters, 1 inch, 1.5 inches, 2 inches, 2.5 inches, 3 inches, any other height that is greater than the height of compact vertical dimension <b>416</b>, or any height (or range of heights) in-between 10 millimeters and 2.5 inches.</p>
<p id="p-0155" num="0154">In some examples, the uncompact vertical dimension <b>420</b> may be a height that is greater than the vertical distance of the vertical gap <b>412</b> in-between the bottom surface <b>404</b><i>a </i>of the bottom central portion <b>404</b> and the bottom surface <b>408</b><i>a </i>of the bottom perimeter portion <b>408</b>. In such examples, this may allow the top portion <b>303</b> of the bottom vessel <b>100</b><i>b </i>to be urged downward so that the top portion <b>303</b> is contracted into a more vertically compact shape (e.g., by the bottom surface <b>404</b><i>a </i>of the top vessel <b>100</b><i>a</i>) when the top vessel <b>100</b><i>a </i>is positioned on the top of the bottom vessel <b>100</b><i>b </i>(as is illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>11</b>B</figref>). It may also allow the top portion <b>303</b> of the bottom vessel <b>100</b><i>b </i>to expand back upwards when the top vessel <b>100</b><i>a </i>is removed from the top of the bottom vessel <b>100</b><i>b. </i></p>
<p id="p-0156" num="0155">The expansion of the top portion <b>303</b> back upwards may be automatic. For example, the expansion may not require the user to pull upward on the top portion <b>303</b>. Instead, the expansion may occur automatically when the downward pressure is removed. The automatic expansion of the top portion <b>303</b> back upwards may allow the vessel <b>100</b> to be more easily stacked. For example, the stacking of the top vessel <b>100</b><i>a </i>on top of the bottom vessel <b>100</b><i>b </i>(as is seen in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>11</b>B</figref>) may contract the top portion <b>303</b>, while removal of the top vessel <b>100</b><i>a </i>from the top of the bottom vessel <b>100</b><i>b </i>may automatically cause the top portion <b>303</b> (e.g., a topmost surface of the top portion <b>303</b>) of the bottom vessel <b>100</b><i>b </i>to move back upwards. As such, the top portion <b>303</b> may now be ready to be gripped or otherwise handled by the user, without any additional action required by the user to expand the top portion <b>303</b> back upwards, in some examples. This may simplify the stacking and unstacking of the vessels <b>100</b>, in some examples.</p>
<p id="p-0157" num="0156">The expansion of the top portion <b>303</b> may occur at any speed. For example, the top portion <b>303</b> may immediately spring upwards. In other examples, the top portion <b>303</b> may more slowly expand upwards.</p>
<p id="p-0158" num="0157">The top portion <b>303</b> of the plug <b>301</b> may be configured in any manner that may allow the top portion <b>303</b> to be contracted (e.g., by a downward pressure) into a more vertically compact shape and/or that may allow the top portion <b>303</b> to expand back upwards out of the more vertically compact shape (e.g., when the downward pressure is removed). For example, the top portion <b>303</b> may be made of a resilient material that allows it to be contracted and/or expand back upwards, such as, for example, silicone rubber. As another example, the top portion <b>303</b> may have a size, shape, and/or configuration that allows it to be contracted and/or expand back upwards. Examples of such a size, shape, and/or configuration are discussed below with regards to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>12</b>A-<b>12</b>E and <b>13</b>A-<b>13</b>C</figref>. In other examples, the top portion <b>303</b> may be made of a resilient material that allows it to be contracted and/or expand back upwards (such as, for example, silicone rubber) and the top portion <b>303</b> may further have a size, shape, and/or configuration that allows it to be contracted and/or expand back upwards. In further examples, the top portion <b>303</b> may be configured in any other manner that may allow it to be contracted and/or expand back upwards, or any combination of the preceding.</p>
<p id="p-0159" num="0158">As is illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>11</b>A</figref>, the plug <b>301</b> may further have the bottom portion <b>304</b> and the central portion <b>302</b>. The bottom portion <b>304</b> may extend outside of the bottom of the hole <b>115</b>, so as to extend vertically below a bottom surface (e.g., internal surface <b>210</b><i>b</i>) of the central portion <b>210</b>. Furthermore, the bottom portion <b>304</b> may have dimensions (e.g., width) that are larger than that of the hole <b>115</b>. This may prevent the plug <b>301</b> from being pulled entirely upward out of the hole <b>115</b>, in some examples. The bottom portion <b>304</b> may also have any shape. For example, the bottom portion <b>304</b> may have the shape of a disk, or may be formed of two or more legs that extend outward from the center of the bottom portion <b>304</b>. If the plug <b>301</b> is monolithic (i.e., formed as a single unit), the legs should be sized and made of a flexible material, so as to allow the legs of the bottom portion <b>304</b> to be pushed downward through the hole <b>115</b> in the lid <b>200</b> (e.g., when the valve <b>300</b> is assembled). It is preferable that the bottom portion <b>304</b> has 3 legs that extend outward from the center of the bottom portion <b>304</b> with an angular separation of about 120 degrees, in some examples. An example of this is illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>12</b>D</figref>. Once the plug <b>301</b> is inserted into the hole <b>115</b> (with the bottom portion <b>304</b> extending outside of the bottom of the hole <b>115</b>), this may make it difficult to dislodge the plug <b>301</b> from the hole <b>115</b> (even when a user pulls upward on the plug <b>301</b>, so as to close the valve <b>300</b>), in some examples.</p>
<p id="p-0160" num="0159">The central portion <b>302</b> may be positioned in-between and couple the top portion <b>303</b> to the bottom portion <b>304</b>. The central portion <b>302</b> may include two regions: a top wide region <b>302</b><i>a </i>and a bottom narrow region <b>302</b><i>b</i>. The top wide region <b>302</b><i>a </i>may have a shape and/or size that is the same (or bigger than) the shape and/or size of the hole <b>115</b>. As such, when the top wide region <b>302</b><i>a </i>is positioned within (or aligned with) the hole <b>115</b> (e.g., when the plug <b>301</b> is moved downward in relation to the lid <b>200</b> so that that top wide region <b>302</b><i>a </i>is positioned within the sidewalls of the hole <b>115</b>, an example of which is seen in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b>B</figref> and <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>11</b>A</figref>), the top wide region <b>302</b><i>a </i>may at least substantially close the hole <b>115</b>, preventing air from passing through the valve <b>300</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0161" num="0160">The bottom narrow region <b>302</b><i>b </i>may have a shape and/or size that is different than and/or smaller than the shape and/or size of the hole <b>115</b>. As such, when the bottom narrow region <b>302</b><i>b </i>is positioned within (or aligned with) the hole <b>115</b> (e.g., when the plug <b>301</b> is moved upward in relation to the lid <b>200</b> so that that bottom narrow region <b>302</b><i>b </i>is positioned within the sidewalls of the hole <b>115</b>), an air passageway may be provided through the hole <b>115</b>. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b>A</figref> illustrates an example of this positioning and the air passageway. As an example of the shape and/or size of the bottom narrow region <b>302</b><i>b</i>, the bottom narrow region <b>302</b><i>b </i>may not be as wide as the hole <b>115</b> (but it may be as vertically thick or thicker than the thickness of the hole <b>115</b>). As another example, the bottom narrow region <b>302</b><i>b </i>may be a different shape than the hole (e.g., the hole <b>115</b> may have a circular cross section but the bottom narrow region <b>302</b><i>b </i>may have a triangular cross section).</p>
<p id="p-0162" num="0161">When the valve <b>300</b> is open (e.g., when the plug <b>301</b> is pulled upward), air and vapor may exit the hole <b>115</b>, and external air may enter the hole <b>115</b> (which may release a vacuum within the fluid retaining interior region <b>190</b> of the container <b>110</b>). Alternatively, when the valve <b>300</b> is closed (e.g., when the plug <b>301</b> is pushed downward), air and vapor may be prevented from exiting the hole <b>115</b>, and external air may be prevented from entering the hole <b>115</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0163" num="0162">The valve <b>300</b> may further include an o-ring to seal and be in threaded engagement with the lid <b>200</b> via the perimeter of the hole <b>115</b>, or an insert therein (which is not shown), in some examples. Furthermore, although the valve <b>300</b> is illustrated as being open when the plug <b>301</b> is pulled upward, in some examples the valve <b>300</b> may be closed when the plug <b>301</b> is pulled upward (and may be open when the plug <b>301</b> is pushed downward). In such examples, the bottom narrow region <b>302</b><i>b </i>may be positioned vertically above the top wide region <b>302</b><i>a. </i></p>
<p id="p-0164" num="0163">In a preferred example, the valve <b>300</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>11</b>A-<b>11</b>B</figref> may further be able to provide one or more indications about the food held and/or stored in the food storage or cooking vessel <b>100</b> via marking(s) <b>290</b> on the lid <b>200</b> and the pointing hole <b>306</b>, as is discussed above with regard to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>6</b></figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0165" num="0164">The central portion <b>210</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>11</b>A-<b>11</b>B</figref> may include any number of valves <b>300</b>. For example, the central portion <b>210</b> may include 1 valve <b>300</b>, 2 valves <b>300</b>, 3 valves <b>300</b>, 4 valves <b>300</b>, any other number of valves <b>300</b>, or any number of valves <b>300</b> (or range of valves <b>300</b>) in-between 1 valve <b>300</b> and 4 valves <b>300</b>. Furthermore, the valve(s) <b>300</b> may be positioned in any location in the central portion <b>210</b>. For example, the valve <b>300</b> may be positioned in the center of the central portion <b>210</b>, off-center in the central portion <b>210</b>, in a corner of the central portion <b>210</b>, any other location in the central portion <b>210</b>, or any combination of the preceding. As is illustrated, the central portion <b>210</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>11</b>A-<b>11</b>B</figref> includes a single valve <b>300</b> positioned in the center of the central portion <b>210</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0166" num="0165">In another preferred example, the vessel <b>100</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>11</b>A-<b>11</b>B</figref> may include a gasket <b>220</b> with a self-venting flexible skirt <b>224</b>, as is discussed above with regard to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>7</b>A-<b>9</b></figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0167" num="0166">Modifications, additions, and/or substitutions may be made to the food storage or cooking vessel <b>100</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>11</b>A-<b>11</b>B</figref> without departing from the scope of the specification. For example, although the food storage or cooking vessel <b>100</b> is described above as including each of valve(s) <b>300</b>, marking(s) <b>290</b>, and a self-venting flexible skirt <b>224</b>, in some examples the food storage or cooking vessel <b>100</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>11</b>A-<b>11</b>B</figref> may include only valve(s) <b>300</b>, only marking(s) <b>290</b>, only a self-venting flexible skirt <b>224</b>, only two of the previous three features, or none of the previous three features.</p>
<p id="p-0168" num="0167">Furthermore, although the valve(s) <b>300</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>11</b>A-<b>11</b>B</figref> have been described above as being used with a particular container <b>110</b> and a particular lid <b>200</b>, the valve(s) <b>300</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>11</b>A-<b>11</b>B</figref> may be used with any type of container and any type of lid. For example, the valve(s) <b>300</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>11</b>A-<b>11</b>B</figref> may be used with a lid that may not include a central portion <b>210</b>, a gasket <b>220</b>, or a lid rim <b>250</b>. As an example of this, the lid may be a single glass lid or a single plastic lid. In such an example, the valve(s) <b>300</b> may be positioned in a portion of the single glass lid, or in a portion of the single plastic lid.</p>
<p id="p-0169" num="0168"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>12</b>A-<b>12</b>E</figref> and <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>13</b>A-<b>13</b>C</figref> illustrate examples of the plug <b>301</b> of the food storage or cooking vessel of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>11</b>A-<b>11</b>B</figref>. As is discussed above, the top portion <b>303</b> of the plug <b>301</b> may have a size, shape, and/or configuration that may allow the top portion <b>303</b> to be contracted (e.g., by a downward pressure) into a more vertically compact shape and/or that may allow the top portion <b>303</b> to expand back upwards out of the more vertically compact shape (e.g., when the downward pressure is removed). <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>12</b>A-<b>12</b>E</figref> illustrate examples of such a size, shape, and/or configuration of the top portion <b>303</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0170" num="0169">As is illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>12</b>A</figref>, the top portion <b>303</b> of the plug <b>301</b> may include a top level <b>432</b>, a bottom level <b>436</b>, and two or more connecting segments <b>440</b>. The top level <b>432</b> may be the topmost portion of the plug <b>301</b>. When downward pressure is applied to the top level <b>432</b> of the plug <b>301</b>, the top portion <b>303</b> may contract into a more vertically compact shape, as is discussed above. An example of the top portion <b>303</b> contracted into a more vertically compact shape is illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>12</b>E</figref>. Additionally, when the downward pressure is removed from the top level <b>432</b>, the top portion <b>303</b> may expand back upwards out of the more vertically compact shape, as is also discussed above. An example of the top portion <b>303</b> expanded back upwards out of the more vertically compact shape is illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>12</b>A</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0171" num="0170">The top level <b>432</b> may be shaped substantially as a circle (e.g., it may be shaped as a perfect circle, it may be shaped as an irregular circle, it may be shaped as an oval, etc.). Furthermore, in other examples, the top level <b>432</b> may be shaped as any other shape, such as a square, a rectangle, a diamond, an irregular shape, any other shape, or any combination of the preceding.</p>
<p id="p-0172" num="0171">The top level <b>432</b> may further have an opening <b>448</b> in the center of the top level <b>432</b>, as is illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>12</b>C</figref>. This opening <b>448</b> may allow a user to more easily grip the plug <b>301</b>, so as to open the valve <b>300</b>, to twist the plug <b>301</b>, and/or to lift the lid <b>200</b> entirely off of the container <b>110</b>. Additionally, this opening <b>448</b> may further assist in the top portion <b>303</b> being contracted into a more vertically compact shape. For example, the opening <b>448</b> may provide a space into which the bottom level <b>436</b> and the two or more connecting segments <b>440</b> may fit when the top portion <b>303</b> is contracted. When contracted, the top level <b>432</b> may move downwards toward the lid <b>200</b>. This downward movement of the top level <b>432</b> may cause the two or more connecting segments <b>440</b> to fold (or otherwise move) into the opening <b>448</b> of the top level <b>432</b>. Additionally, in some examples, the top level <b>432</b> may further move far enough downward that the opening <b>448</b> envelopes all or a portion of the bottom level <b>436</b> (i.e., all or portion of the bottom level <b>436</b> may fit in the opening <b>448</b>). As such, this may further reduce the compact vertical dimension <b>416</b> of the top portion <b>303</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0173" num="0172">As is discussed above, the top portion <b>303</b> may further include the bottom level <b>436</b>, and the two or more connecting segments <b>440</b>. The bottom level <b>436</b> may be the bottommost portion of the top portion <b>303</b>. Furthermore, the bottom level <b>436</b> may connect the top portion <b>303</b> to the central portion <b>302</b> of the plug <b>301</b>. The bottom level <b>436</b> may have any shape and/or size that allows all or a portion of the bottom level <b>436</b> to fit within the opening <b>448</b> when the top portion <b>303</b> is contracted by a downward pressure. In some examples, when the top portion <b>303</b> is contracted into the more vertically compact shape, the bottom level <b>436</b> may not be contracted. That is, during the contraction of the top portion <b>303</b>, the bottom level <b>436</b> may remain substantially in the same position as it was prior to the contraction (e.g., the bottom level <b>436</b> may not move and/or the material of the bottom level <b>436</b> may not be compressed, or the movement and/or compression may be by an insignificant amount in comparison to the movement of the top level <b>432</b> and connecting segments <b>440</b>). In such examples, only the top level <b>432</b> and the connecting segments <b>440</b> may be contracted. An example of this is illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>12</b>E</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0174" num="0173">The connecting segments <b>440</b> may connect the top level <b>432</b> to the bottom level <b>436</b>. To do so, the connecting segments <b>440</b> may extend upward from the bottom level <b>436</b> to the top level <b>432</b>. As is illustrated, the connecting segments <b>440</b> may spiral upward (e.g., they may extend upward in a spiral configuration) from the bottom level <b>436</b> to the top level <b>432</b>. By spiraling upward, the connecting segments <b>440</b> be predisposed to be moved so as to fit into the opening <b>448</b> when the top portion <b>303</b> is contracted into a more vertically compact shape by a downward pressure.</p>
<p id="p-0175" num="0174">The connecting segments <b>440</b> may have any shape and/or size that allows them to fit within the opening <b>448</b> when the top portion <b>303</b> is contracted by a downward pressure. Additionally, the top portion <b>303</b> may include any number of connecting segments <b>440</b>. For example, the top portion <b>303</b> may include 2 connecting segments <b>440</b>, 3 connecting segments <b>440</b>, 4 connecting segments <b>440</b>, or any other number of connecting segments <b>400</b>. In some examples, the top portion <b>303</b> may include only 1 connecting segment <b>440</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0176" num="0175"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>13</b>A-<b>13</b>C</figref> illustrate another example of the plug <b>301</b> of the food storage or cooking vessel of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>11</b>A-<b>11</b>B</figref>. As is illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>13</b>A-<b>13</b>C</figref>, the top portion <b>303</b> of the plug <b>301</b> may include a flap <b>452</b> that is coupled to and extends upward from the central portion <b>302</b> of the plug <b>301</b>. The flap <b>452</b> may extend upward in any manner from the central portion <b>302</b>. For example, the flap <b>452</b> may curve upward, extend upward in a straight diagonal line, extend upward in steps (e.g., like a stairwell), extend upward in any other manner, or any combination of the preceding. As is illustrated, the flap <b>452</b> curves upward. The flap <b>452</b> may have any curvature that allows it to curve upwards. Furthermore, the flap <b>452</b> may be coupled to the central portion <b>302</b> at a bottom section of the curvature of the flap <b>452</b>, as is illustrated. This may allow the flap <b>452</b> to curve upward from this coupling. Additionally, it may allow the flap <b>452</b> to extend upward and outward from the coupling, which may increase the ability of the top portion <b>303</b> to be contracted into a more vertically compact shape.</p>
<p id="p-0177" num="0176">The topmost portion of the flap <b>452</b> may form the topmost portion of the plug <b>301</b> (e.g., the top level). When downward pressure is applied to the flap <b>452</b> of the plug <b>301</b>, the top portion <b>303</b> may be contracted into a more vertically compact shape, as is discussed above. An example of the top portion <b>303</b> contracted into a more vertically compact shape is illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>13</b>C</figref>. When contracted into a more vertically compact shape, the upward curve of the flap <b>452</b> may bend downward so that it flattens out at (or near) the top surface of the lid <b>200</b>. Additionally, when the downward pressure is removed from the flap <b>452</b>, the top portion <b>303</b> may expand back upwards out of the more vertically compact shape, as is also discussed above. An example of the top portion <b>303</b> expanded back upwards out of the more vertically compact shape is illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>13</b>A-<b>13</b>B</figref>. This expansion may cause the flap <b>452</b> to reform its upward curve.</p>
<p id="p-0178" num="0177">As is illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>13</b>C</figref>, the flap <b>452</b> may include a bottom level <b>454</b>. This bottom level <b>454</b> of the flap <b>452</b> may be the bottommost portion of the top portion <b>303</b>. Additionally, this bottom level <b>454</b> may not curve upward with the remaining portion of the flap <b>452</b> (e.g., it may be the bottom section of the curvature of the flap <b>452</b>, as is discussed above). In some examples, when the top portion <b>303</b> is contracted into the more vertically compact shape, the bottom level <b>454</b> may not be contracted. That is, during the contraction of the top portion <b>303</b>, the bottom level <b>454</b> may remain substantially in the same position as it was prior to the contraction (e.g., the bottom level <b>454</b> may not move and/or the material of the bottom level <b>454</b> may not be compressed, or the movement and/or compression may be by an insignificant amount in comparison to the movement of the remaining portion of the flap <b>452</b>). In such examples, only the remaining portion of the top flap <b>452</b> may be contracted. An example of this is illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>13</b>C</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0179" num="0178">The flap <b>452</b> may be shaped substantially as a circle (e.g., it may be shaped as a perfect circle, it may be shaped as an irregular circle, it may be shaped as an oval, etc.). Furthermore, in other examples, the flap <b>452</b> may be shaped as any other shape, such as a square, a rectangle, a diamond, an irregular shape, any other shape, or any combination of the preceding.</p>
<p id="p-0180" num="0179">The flap <b>452</b> may have an opening <b>456</b> in the center of the flap <b>452</b>. This opening <b>456</b> may allow a user to more easily grip the plug <b>301</b>, so as to open the valve <b>300</b>, to twist the plug <b>301</b>, and/or to lift the lid <b>200</b> entirely off of the container <b>110</b>. In other examples, the flap <b>452</b> may not have an opening <b>456</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0181" num="0180">Modifications, additions, and/or substitutions may be made to the food storage or cooking vessel (or any of the components of the food storage or cooking vessel) of each of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>1</b>A-<b>13</b>C</figref> without departing from the scope of the specification. For example, any of the food storage or cooking vessels (or any of the components of the food storage or cooking vessel) of any of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>1</b>A-<b>13</b>C</figref> may be combined with or replaced with any of the other food storage or cooking vessels (or any of the components of the food storage or cooking vessels) of any of the other <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>1</b>A-<b>13</b>C</figref>. For example, the gasket <b>220</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b>A</figref> may be replaced with the gasket <b>220</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>10</b>A</figref> or the gasket <b>220</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>10</b>C</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0182" num="0181">The vessel <b>100</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>1</b>A-<b>13</b>C</figref> may be used for both storing and cooking foods. Foods can be cooked in a microwave oven with the lid <b>200</b> in place, and briefly finished in a conventional or convection oven to brown the food after the lid <b>200</b> is removed.</p>
<p id="p-0183" num="0182">The use of a metal annular lid rim <b>250</b> reinforces a soft rubber gasket <b>220</b> to prevent the vacuum from the cooling of food from pulling or displacing the container lid <b>200</b> from the container rim <b>140</b>. The gasket <b>220</b> however provides the option of storing food under vacuum in a refrigerator or freezer.</p>
<p id="p-0184" num="0183">It has also been discovered that the metal annular lid rim <b>250</b> does not get excessively hot from microwave cooking, as it appears to reflect microwave energy, and though the internal portion of the lid <b>200</b> and container sidewall <b>130</b> are heated from the food and steam generated in cooking, a rubber gasket <b>220</b>, being a good thermal insulator, relative to glass, prevents transfer of the heat to the metal annular lid rim <b>250</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0185" num="0184">As such, the lid <b>200</b> can be left in place when food is brought to the table for serving. As the gasket <b>220</b> prevents the leakage of hot air and steam, food will remain hot for at least 30 minutes, and depending on the initial temperature, substantially warm for 45 minutes or longer. These benefits are achieved when the lid <b>200</b> is about 4 mm thick and the container sidewall <b>130</b> is about 5 mm thick. Glass within this range of thickness aids in retaining heat, but still does not heat the metal lid rim <b>250</b> or the handle or grip portion (e.g., top portion <b>303</b>) of the valve <b>300</b>. Hence, food can be served directly from the table by lifting the lid <b>200</b> at the time of a meal, without a concern the lid edge, or metal, or the grip being too hot, but the food will have remained very warm.</p>
<p id="p-0186" num="0185">It should be appreciated that when the flexible skirt <b>224</b> and sidewall <b>130</b> are shaped to promote a large area of mutual contact at the inner surface <b>130</b><i>b</i>, such contacting area may provide friction that resists the unintended removal of the lid <b>200</b> from the container <b>110</b> in the absence of a vacuum in cavity <b>190</b>. However, too large a contact area would reduce the ability of the gasket outward facing portion <b>224</b><i>a </i>to flip (so that it faces inward) as illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>7</b>A-C</figref> and <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>8</b></figref>. It has been discovered that it is preferable that between 5 to 60% (and more preferably between 10 to 50%) of the surface area (or the arcuate length) of the outward facing portion <b>224</b><i>a </i>should make contact with the internal surface <b>130</b><i>b </i>of the sidewall <b>130</b> of the container <b>110</b> to provide sufficient friction to resist the lid <b>200</b> being easily displaced (which could cause the contents to leak), but still be capable of flipping to preclude an excess vacuum level (i.e., to self-vent). An example of this 5 to 60% of the surface area (or the arcuate length) of the outward facing portion <b>224</b><i>a </i>in contact with the internal surface <b>130</b><i>b </i>is shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>7</b>A</figref>.</p>
