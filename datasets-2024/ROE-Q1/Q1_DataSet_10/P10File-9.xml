<p id="p-0045" num="0044">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref> and <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref>, the present disclosure relates to an atomizing core <b>100</b> and an atomizer <b>200</b>, and the atomizing core <b>100</b> is inserted into the atomizer <b>200</b> for heating to produce smoke for use by a consumer.</p>
<p id="p-0046" num="0045">The following will first describe the atomizing core <b>100</b> of the present disclosure.</p>
<p id="p-0047" num="0046">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref>, the atomizing core <b>100</b> comprises a core <b>110</b>, a heater <b>120</b>, a flow guiding element <b>130</b>, a filter <b>140</b> and a tube <b>150</b>. The core <b>110</b> comprises a first end <b>112</b> and a second end <b>114</b>, and the second end <b>114</b> is disposed on an opposite side of the first end <b>112</b>. The heater <b>120</b> is disposed around an outer periphery <b>116</b> of the core <b>110</b>. The heater <b>120</b> comprises a heating pipe <b>122</b> and a heat conducting pipe <b>124</b>. The heat conducting pipe <b>124</b> surrounds and contacts the outer periphery <b>116</b> of the core <b>110</b>, and the heating pipe <b>122</b> surrounds and contacts an outer periphery of the heat conducting pipe <b>124</b>, thereby completing the heating of the core <b>110</b>. The flow guiding element <b>130</b> is disposed on the second end <b>114</b> of the core <b>110</b>, and the filter <b>140</b> is disposed on a side of the flow guiding element <b>130</b> away from the core <b>110</b>, so that the flow guiding element <b>130</b> can guide the generated smoke to the filter <b>140</b>. The tube <b>150</b> is used to cover the core <b>110</b>, the heater <b>120</b>, the flow guiding element <b>130</b> and the filter <b>140</b>. In an embodiment of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref>, the filter <b>140</b> and the tube <b>150</b> have been integrally formed in an assembly stage, but this is not a limitation.</p>
<p id="p-0048" num="0047">As shown in an enlarged view of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b></figref>, the tube <b>150</b> has a first electrode <b>152</b> and a second electrode <b>154</b>, and the first electrode <b>152</b> and the second electrode <b>154</b> are spaced apart from each other and disposed on an outer periphery of the heating pipe <b>122</b> (as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>6</b></figref>). That is, the first electrode <b>152</b> and the second electrode <b>154</b> of the tube <b>150</b> are disposed corresponding to the outer periphery of the heating pipe <b>122</b>. Preferably, the first electrode <b>152</b> and the second electrode <b>154</b> are annular electrodes and are disposed around the outer periphery of the heating pipe <b>122</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0049" num="0048">In an embodiment, the assembly sequence of the atomizing core <b>100</b> of the present disclosure is as follows: (1) assembling the core <b>110</b> and the flow guiding element <b>130</b> shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref>; (2) disposing the heat conducting pipe <b>124</b> of the heater <b>120</b> on the assembled core <b>110</b> and the flow guiding element <b>130</b>, and then disposing the heating pipe <b>122</b> of the heater <b>120</b> on the outer periphery of the heating pipe <b>124</b>, and (3) disposing the tube <b>150</b> with the filter <b>140</b> on the heating pipe <b>122</b>. Please refer to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b></figref> and <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>6</b></figref> for a sleeve relationship of the components of the atomizing core <b>100</b> after the assembly is completed.</p>
<p id="p-0050" num="0049">The above assembling sequence can also be changed according to other requirements, which is not limited here. For example, the heat conducting pipe <b>124</b> and the heating pipe <b>122</b> of the heater <b>120</b> can be sequentially assembled in the tube <b>150</b> with the filter <b>140</b>, and then the flow guiding element <b>130</b> and the core <b>110</b> can be accommodated in the heater <b>120</b> in sequence.</p>
<p id="p-0051" num="0050">Please refer to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref> again, in an embodiment, the heating pipe <b>122</b> is a resistance mesh pipe, and the resistance mesh pipe is a mesh-shaped pipe and is disposed between the core <b>110</b> and the tube <b>150</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0052" num="0051">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref> and <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>6</b></figref>, the heater <b>120</b> further comprises a heat conducting sheet <b>126</b>. The heat conducting pipe <b>124</b> is disposed on the outer periphery <b>116</b> of the core <b>110</b>, and the heat conducting sheet <b>126</b> covers the first end <b>112</b> of the core <b>110</b>. In other words, the heat conducting pipe <b>124</b> is disposed between the core <b>110</b> and the heating pipe <b>122</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0053" num="0052">By making the heat conducting pipe <b>124</b> surrounds and contacts the outer periphery <b>116</b> of the core <b>110</b>, the heating pipe <b>122</b> surrounds and contacts the outer periphery of the heat conducting pipe <b>124</b>, and the heat conducting sheet <b>126</b> covers the first end <b>112</b> of the core <b>110</b>, after the first electrode <b>152</b> and the second electrode <b>154</b> of the tube <b>150</b> are electrically connected through the heating pipe <b>122</b>, the heating pipe <b>122</b> can be rapidly heated to about 300&#xb0; C. to 320&#xb0; C. in a short time to complete the heating, and the heat generated by the heating pipe <b>122</b> can be further conducted through the heat conducting pipe <b>124</b> and the heat conducting sheet <b>126</b> to bake the outer periphery <b>116</b> and the first end <b>112</b> of the core <b>110</b>, so that the core <b>110</b> generates smoke due to the burning. Finally, the smoke enters the user's mouth or nasal cavity along the flow guiding element <b>130</b> and the filter <b>140</b> by the user's suction.</p>
<p id="p-0054" num="0053">In an embodiment, a resistance of the heating pipe <b>122</b> is between 0.6 ohms and 1.75 ohms, and a thickness of the heating pipe <b>122</b> is 0.02 mm. The heat conducting pipe <b>124</b> is a graphene heat conducting pipe, the heat conducting sheet <b>126</b> is a graphene heat conducting sheet, and both thicknesses of them are 0.05 mm, so as to provide excellent heat transfer efficiency with thinning. In addition, a high melting point of graphene can also avoid the problem of dry burning, thereby greatly improving the safety of burning. The core <b>110</b> is composed of at least one of solid herb, a solid tobacco oil, an herbal filament and a tobacco filament, so that it can be adjusted according to the needs of different users.</p>
<p id="p-0055" num="0054">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>7</b></figref>, the flow guiding element <b>130</b> comprises a plurality of flow guiding channels <b>132</b>, the plurality of flow guiding channels <b>132</b> respectively extend axially from the core <b>110</b> to the filter <b>140</b> and are spaced apart from each other in a radial direction. In a preferred embodiment, a radial arrangement of the plurality of flow guiding channels <b>132</b> is as follows: a single flow guiding channel <b>132</b> is disposed in a middle, a plurality of flow guiding channels <b>132</b> arranged in a ring are disposed on a second layer outside the single flow guiding channel <b>132</b>, and a plurality of flow guiding channels <b>132</b> are arranged in a circular disposed on a third layer outside the single flow guiding channel <b>132</b>. In some embodiments, an arrangement density of the flow guiding channels <b>132</b> on the second layer and the flow guiding channels <b>132</b> on the third layer are different (i.e., intervals between two adjacent flow guiding channels <b>132</b> in a circumferential direction are different). Through an arrangement of the plurality of flow guiding channels <b>132</b>, the flow guiding element <b>130</b> can guide atomized gas more uniformly and can improve the heat dissipation effect to help reduce the temperature of the smoke generated by the core <b>110</b> due to the burning. In some embodiments, a material with high thermal conductivity, such as copper, may be used to help dissipate heat.</p>
<p id="p-0056" num="0055">An atomizer <b>200</b> of the present disclosure comprises an atomizer body <b>300</b> and the above atomizing core <b>100</b>, and the atomizing core <b>100</b> is disposed in the atomizer body <b>300</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0057" num="0056">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>8</b></figref> and <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>10</b></figref>, the atomizer body <b>300</b> comprises a heating module <b>400</b>, a main chip control module <b>500</b> and a battery module <b>600</b> in order from one end (the left end of the drawing) to the other end (the right end of the drawing).

<p id="p-0058" num="0057">Further, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>10</b></figref> and <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>11</b></figref>, the heating module <b>400</b> further comprises a first heating electrode <b>420</b> and a second heating electrode <b>430</b> disposed in the heating chamber <b>410</b>. The first heating electrode <b>420</b> and the second heating electrode <b>430</b> are disposed opposite and spaced apart from each other at a bottom of the heating chamber <b>410</b>, and the first heating electrode <b>420</b> and the second heating electrode <b>430</b> are correspondingly and electrically connected to the first electrode <b>152</b> and the second electrode <b>154</b> of the tube <b>150</b> of the atomizing core <b>100</b>. The main chip control module <b>500</b> can only allow the battery module <b>600</b> to perform related power supply operations when it detects that the first heating electrode <b>420</b> and the second heating electrode <b>430</b> are in an on state or when a specific resistance value is measured to ensure the safety of the atomizer body <b>300</b> during use.</p>
<p id="p-0059" num="0058">In the present disclosure, since the first electrode <b>152</b> and the second electrode <b>154</b> of the tube <b>150</b> are both annular electrodes, when the atomizing core <b>100</b> is inserted into the heating chamber <b>410</b> of the heating module <b>400</b>, no matter a radial angle of the atomizing core <b>100</b> is, both the first electrode <b>152</b> and the second electrode <b>154</b> can contact and electrically connect to the first heating electrode <b>420</b> and the second heating electrode <b>430</b> in the heating chamber <b>410</b>, so that the heating pipe <b>122</b> can complete the conduction between the first electrode <b>152</b> and the second electrode <b>154</b> and heat up the heating pipe <b>122</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0060" num="0059">It should be noted that, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>11</b></figref> and <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>12</b></figref>, in the present disclosure, the first heating electrode <b>420</b> comprises a first conducting column <b>422</b> and a first conducting sheet <b>424</b>. The first conducting sheet <b>424</b> comprises a first sleeve portion <b>426</b> sleeved on the first conducting column <b>422</b> and a first arc-shaped portion <b>428</b> connected to the first sleeve portion <b>426</b>, and the first arc-shaped portion <b>428</b> is disposed on an inner peripheral surface of the heating chamber <b>410</b>.

Because the first heating electrode <b>420</b> contacts and electrically connects to the first electrode <b>152</b>, and the second heating electrode <b>430</b> contacts and electrically connects to the second electrode <b>154</b>, the above first height H1 and the second height H2 are different from each other, and a height difference between the first height H1 and the second height H2 can be regarded as a distance between the first electrode <b>152</b> and the second electrode <b>154</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0062" num="0061">In another embodiment, after the first conducting sheet <b>424</b> extends upward along the axial direction of the heating chamber <b>410</b> by the first height H1, it can also be bent by 90 degrees to the left and right and extended along the inner surface of the heating chamber <b>410</b>, thereby forming a T-shaped electrode.
