<heading id="h-0001" level="1">CROSS-REFERENCE TO RELATED APPLICATIONS</heading>
<p id="p-0002" num="0001">This Application is a continuation of International Patent Application No. PCT/GB2021/052424, filed on Sep. 17, 2021, which claims priority to GB Application No. 2014726.0, filed on Sep. 18, 2020, the entire contents of each of which are hereby incorporated by reference.</p>
<heading id="h-0002" level="1">INTRODUCTION</heading>
<heading id="h-0003" level="1">Technical Field</heading>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">The present disclosure concerns wearable items. More particularly, but not exclusively, this disclosure concerns a wearable item comprising a motion control system. The disclosure also concerns a method of manufacturing a wearable item comprising a motion control system.</p>
<heading id="h-0004" level="1">Background</heading>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">The present disclosure relates to body-close wearable items for use during exercise. Examples of such wearable items include compression garments, sports bras, and kinesiology tape.</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">Hamstring strain injuries (HSI) are common in sports involving sprinting and jumping. During high speed running, the biceps femoris long head is the muscle most frequently injured, often where the muscle fibers join the tendon. The severity of the strain can vary from mild to a complete tear of the muscle. HSI often occur as a result of muscle overstretching and/or absorption of energy from the decelerating limb whilst the muscles are lengthening. It is accepted that injury severity can be reduced or prevented entirely by altering an athletes' range of motion (ROM), reducing the demands on muscles, or by reducing soft tissue oscillations and vibration during activity. Therefore, controlling the muscle to reduce the range of motion to just the axial direction may reduce the risk of injury, as the muscle will not swing in the circumferential/radial direction adding strain to the tendon and increasing the risk of tearing/snapping. Compression garments can help to prevent HSI and improve performance by exerting global and or local pressure on the soft tissue. The pressure limits ROM, reduces soft tissue oscillations and accelerates muscle oxygenation.</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">Compression garments, by virtue of their mode of operation, are also inherently difficult for a user to put on and take off, as they are designed to be narrower than the body part on which they are to be worn, such that the garment applies pressure to the body part when worn.</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">Kinesiology tapes (KT) and athletic tapes are used in therapy and to enhance sporting performance and are applied over injury-prone or rehabilitating areas of the body following kinesiology principles. Although physiological improvements are seen when kinesiology tape is worn, the exact physiological effect of the tape is not known. It has been found that kinesiology tape can have beneficial effects on oedema, muscular performance and facilitation, proprioception, balance, and pain. Kinesiology tape works in a similar manner to compression garments by limiting and controlling soft-tissue movement to reduce the risk of injury.</p>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">The present disclosure seeks to mitigate the above-mentioned problems. Alternatively or additionally, the present disclosure seeks to provide improved body-close wearable items for use during exercise.</p>
<heading id="h-0005" level="1">SUMMARY</heading>
<p id="p-0009" num="0008">According to a first aspect of the present disclosure, there is provided a wearable item comprising a motion control system, wherein the wearable item comprises a body-close wearable item which, when worn by a user, at least a part of the wearable item is positioned adjacent to the body of the user, and wherein the motion control system comprises at least one layer of strain-rate sensitive material configured to control motion of one or more body parts of the user.</p>
<p id="p-0010" num="0009">According to a second aspect of the disclosure there is also provided a method of manufacturing a wearable item comprising a motion control system, the method comprising: forming the wearable item comprising a body-close wearable item which, when worn by a user, at least a part of the wearable item is positioned adjacent to the body of the user; and forming the motion control system comprising at least one layer of strain-rate sensitive material configured to control motion of one or more body parts of the user.</p>
<p id="p-0011" num="0010">It will of course be appreciated that features described in relation to one aspect of the present disclosure may be incorporated into other aspects of the present disclosure. For example, methods of the disclosure may incorporate any of the features described with reference to apparatus of the disclosure and vice versa.</p>

<heading id="h-0007" level="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION</heading>
<p id="p-0071" num="0070"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref> shows a perspective view of a human lower leg <b>10</b>. The effectiveness of compression shorts can be evaluated by measuring hamstring soft tissue accelerations in the axial direction <b>11</b> (i.e. along the bone), the circumferential direction <b>12</b> (i.e. around the bone), and the radial direction <b>13</b> (i.e. towards/away from the bone).</p>
<p id="p-0072" num="0071"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref> shows a chart of the resultant root mean squared acceleration of a user's hamstring muscle for both non-compression shorts and compression shorts. When wearing the non-compression shorts, the user experiences muscle acceleration of 20.42 ms<sup>&#x2212;2</sup>. When wearing the compression shorts, the user experiences muscle acceleration of 19.99 ms<sup>&#x2212;2 </sup>(a reduction of approximately 2%). Thus, the compression shorts provide only a marginal reduction in resultant muscle accelerations compared to non-compressive shorts. Compression shorts therefore provide no significant enhancement of athlete performance or reduction in the probability of hamstring injury.</p>
<p id="p-0073" num="0072">Running without a sports bra has been found to increase vertical displacement of the breast and exercise-induced breast discomfort, particularly in women with larger breasts. Sports bras of the prior art are either encapsulating or compressive. Encapsulating sports bras have cups which fit around each breast; these are comfortable to wear but provide minimal support. Compressive sports bras are much more supportive, but compromise on comfort and ease of donning and doffing. Historically, manufacturers of sports bra have relied on compressing the breast tissue to be closer to the chest, in order to minimise movement during exercise. This can cause discomfort due to tight fitting bras, particularly on larger busted women. The wide variety of size, shape and density of breast tissue makes producing well-fitting sports bras a complex challenge. Elastic textiles have been widely used in the application of sports bras to allow for differences in breast, shape, size, and weight in order to accommodate a wide range of women. The higher the amount of stretch in the textiles, the more forgiving the fit. However, this can lead to lower levels of support and therefore increased breast tissue movement during exercise. Conversely, tight-fitting bras with lower amounts of stretch can be less comfortable and can compromise the female form. Sports bras, by their nature, are also required to be lightweight and breathable in order to be fit for use in physical activity.</p>
<p id="p-0074" num="0073"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref> shows a perspective view of a sports bra <b>30</b> on a wearer. The effectiveness of a sports bra can be evaluated by measuring breast tissue accelerations in the axial direction <b>31</b> (i.e. along the torso, in the cranial caudal plane), the circumferential direction <b>32</b> (i.e. around the torso, in the medial-lateral plane), and the radial direction <b>33</b> (i.e. towards/away from the torso, in the anterior-posterior plane).</p>
<p id="p-0075" num="0074">A first aspect of the present disclosure provides a wearable item comprising a motion control system. It will be understood that, in this context, a motion control system refers to a system that acts to limit and/or damp motion (for example, of a part of the user's body).</p>
<p id="p-0076" num="0075">The wearable item comprises a body-close wearable item which, when worn by a user, at least a part of the wearable item is positioned adjacent to the body of the user. It will be understood by the skilled person that &#x201c;body close&#x201d; refers to a characteristic of the wearable item of, when worn by a user, conforming to the shape of the user's body. Thus, the body-close wearable item can be said to be &#x201c;skin-tight&#x201d;. It should be understood that at least some, but not necessarily all, of the wearable item is body-close, i.e. one or more parts or portions of the wearable item are body-close but one or more parts or portions of the wearable item may not be body-close. The skilled person will also appreciate that &#x201c;adjacent&#x201d; does not, in this context, require that the wearable item be in direct contact with the wearer's skin. The wearable item may, for example, be worn over another item of clothing. In such cases, the wearable item will nonetheless be adjacent to the user's body by virtue of the wearable item being body-close. The requirement that the wearable item be adjacent to the user's body will therefore be understood by the skilled person to mean that the wearable item, when worn by a user, conforms to the shape of the user's body or part(s) thereof. The skilled person will understand the wearable item to be adjacent to the user's body even where there is a further substance or material positioned between the wearable item and the user.</p>
<p id="p-0077" num="0076">In embodiments, the wearable item comprises one of: a pair of shorts (such as running shorts), a pair of tights (or leggings), a brassiere (such as a sports bra), a tape, a sock, and a sleeve or tube with an opening at both ends. It will be appreciated that the present disclosure is also applicable to other wearable items.</p>
<p id="p-0078" num="0077">In embodiments, the wearable item may be configured such that, after having been deformed (for example, by being stretched over a user's body), the wearable item returns to its original shape. Thus, in such embodiments, the wearable item may be body-close by virtue of its elastic properties. In embodiments, the wearable item comprises an elastic material and the wearable item returns to its original shape due to the elasticity of the elastic material.</p>
<p id="p-0079" num="0078">The motion control system comprises at least one layer of strain-rate sensitive (SRS) material configured to control motion of one or more body parts of the user. A strain rate sensitive material is one which is flexible under low strain rates but, as motion (and therefore strain-rate) increases, becomes less flexible and highly damping, such that it resists the motion. A motion control system incorporating SRS material can therefore be considered to be an &#x201c;active&#x201d; motion control system. Thus, in embodiments, the motion control system is configured to control (for example, to limit and/or damp) motion (for example, of the soft-tissue body parts). In embodiments, controlling the motion encompasses controlling velocity and/or displacement and/or accelerations. In such embodiments, it may be that the SRS material is configured to control (for example, to limit and/or damp) the motion. Thus, the wearable item is flexible and easily stretched at low strain rates but is stiffer and more supportive at higher strain rates. This enables easier donning and doffing of the wearable item and also affords the user a normal range of motion (ROM) whilst also affording increased support when the user engages in athletic activity. The stiffness of the SRS material increases in relation to the applied strain-rate, providing more support as the user performs more vigorous physical activity. The damping coefficient of the SRS material also increases with strain rate. Therefore, the SRS material provides motion control by two mechanisms: (i) by providing increased stiffness as strain rate increases, and (ii) by providing increased damping as the strain rate increases.</p>
<p id="p-0080" num="0079">In embodiments, the at least one layer of strain-rate sensitive material comprises a solid strain-rate sensitive material. The term &#x2018;solid&#x2019; here is intended to mean stable in shape and self-supporting (not liquid or fluid).</p>
<p id="p-0081" num="0080">In embodiments, the at least one layer of strain-rate sensitive material comprises a chemically strain-rate sensitive material. In embodiments, the at least one layer of strain-rate sensitive material comprises a polymer. In embodiments, the at least one layer of strain-rate sensitive material comprises a chemical dilatant.</p>
<p id="p-0082" num="0081">In embodiments, the one or more body parts comprise soft-tissue body parts. In embodiments, the one or more body parts comprise one or more of: a muscle (for example a hamstring muscle) and a breast. It will be appreciated that a wearable item according to the present disclosure may also be used on other body parts.</p>
<p id="p-0083" num="0082">In embodiments, controlling motion from movement of one or more body parts of the user comprises controlling velocity of the soft-tissue body parts. In embodiments, the controlling comprises controlling displacement of the soft-tissue body parts. In embodiments, the controlling comprises controlling acceleration of the soft-tissue body parts. In embodiments, the controlling comprises controlling energy absorption (for example, by the wearable item). In embodiments, the controlling comprises controlling stiffness (for example, of the wearable item).</p>
<p id="p-0084" num="0083">In embodiments, the controlling is dependent on the frequency of motion of the soft-tissue body parts. Thus, the controlling may comprise supressing certain frequencies of movement. In such embodiments, the controlling is greater at relatively high frequencies of motion of the soft-tissue body parts compared to relatively low frequencies of motion of the soft-tissue body parts. Thus, the controlling may comprise supressing relatively high frequencies of movement more than relatively low frequencies. In embodiments, the controlling comprises performing substantially zero control at relatively low frequencies of motion of the soft-tissue body parts. Thus, the controlling may comprise supressing only the relatively high frequencies of movement. In embodiments, the relatively low frequencies comprise frequencies below 5 Hz, or between 1 Hz and 5 Hz. In embodiments, the relatively high frequencies comprise frequencies above 5 Hz, preferably between 10 Hz and 30 Hz. Embodiments in which the controlling is dependent on the frequency of motion can enable the wearable item to constrain undesirable movements of the soft-tissue body part without impeding the desired movement of the soft-tissue body part (for example, the contraction of a muscle) associated with performance of an activity. For example, a runner's muscles will contract with a frequency corresponding to the cadence of the running, but will also undergo higher frequency &#x201c;wobble.&#x201d; A wearable item that is configured to suppress specific frequencies of movement may suppress the muscle &#x201c;wobble&#x201d; frequencies without impeding the frequencies associated with the muscle contraction.</p>
<p id="p-0085" num="0084">In embodiments, the at least one layer of strain-rate sensitive material is configured to control motion of the one or more body parts of the user in a given direction. Thus, the wearable item may be configured to suppress movement in one or more specific directions. For example, the strain-rate sensitive material may be configured to allow movement in a first direction (for example, axially along a bone&#x2014;corresponding to the principal direction of muscle contraction) whilst supressing movement in a second direction (for example, circumferentially around the bone).</p>
<p id="p-0086" num="0085">In embodiments (for example, where the wearable item comprises a compression garment), the given direction comprises one or both of a radial direction from a bone of the user, and a circumferential direction around a bone. In embodiments where the wearable item comprises a pair of shorts, a tape, a sock, or a sleeve or tube with an opening at both ends, the bone of the user may comprise a femur. It will be appreciated that such wearable items may also be worn on other parts of the body. Such embodiments can constrain movement in the radial and/or circumferential directions, which is associated with an increased risk of injury. Thus, such embodiments may reduce the risk of injury to the user from their activity. In embodiments (for example, where the wearable item comprises a sports bra), the given direction comprises one or more a radial direction from a given body part of the user (for example, the user's torso), an axial direction along the given body part, and a circumferential direction around the given body part. In embodiments where the wearable item comprises a brassiere, the given body part of the user may comprise the torso of the user.</p>
<p id="p-0087" num="0086">In embodiments, the at least one layer of strain-rate sensitive material is configured not to control motion of the one or more body parts of the user in a different, given direction. In embodiments, the different, given direction comprises an axial direction along a bone of the user. Such embodiments may allow motion in the axial direction, which is associated with muscle contraction, and therefore do not inhibit the physical activity of the user. Meanwhile, movement in the radial and/or circumferential directions, which is associated with an increased risk of injury, is inhibited, reducing the user's risk of injury.</p>
<p id="p-0088" num="0087">In embodiments, the wearable item comprises a textile layer. In embodiments, the textile layer comprises one or more of knitted textile, woven textile, non-woven textile, and unidirectional fibre textile. In embodiments, it may be that the at least one layer of strain-rate sensitive material is attached to the textile layer. In embodiments, the at least one layer of strain-rate sensitive material is laminated to the textile layer. In embodiments, the at least one layer of strain-rate sensitive material is adhered to the textile layer. In embodiments, the at least one layer of strain-rate sensitive material is woven and/or knitted into the textile layer. In embodiments, the at least one layer of strain-rate sensitive material is heat-pressed onto the textile layer. In embodiments, only a portion of the at least one layer of strain-rate sensitive material is attached to the textile layer. Thus, it may be that at least part of the at least one layer of strain-rate sensitive material is not attached to the textile layer. In such embodiments, it may be that the at least one layer of strain-rate sensitive material is attached to the textile layer at (for example, only at) the edges of the at least one layer of strain-rate sensitive material. In other embodiments, an entire surface of the at least one layer of strain-rate sensitive material is attached to the textile layer. In embodiments, the at least one layer of strain-rate sensitive material is thermoformed to the shape of the garment.</p>
<p id="p-0089" num="0088">In embodiments, the textile layer may be pre-stretched before the at least one layer of strain-rate sensitive material is attached to it, such that the at least one layer of strain-rate sensitive material is attached to the stretched textile layer. Such embodiments can result in the combined SRS and textile layer varying across its surface in a direction perpendicular to the plane of the textile layer (for example, forcing the textile layer to take on a corrugated form). In embodiments, the SRS and/or the textile layer is embossed or de-bossed to provide such a variation (for example, to have a corrugated form). In embodiments, the combined SRS and textile layer is thermoformed to provide such a variation. Such a variation can be referred to as providing texture to the combined SRS and textile layer. Incorporating such a variation can provide an improvement in the performance of the motion control system.</p>
<p id="p-0090" num="0089">It will be appreciated by the skilled person that a given wearable item may comprise multiple layers of strain-rate sensitive material, each of which are attached to the wearable item by a different one of the above listed means. Thus, for example, a wearable item according to embodiments of the present disclosure may comprise a first layer of strain-rate sensitive material adhered to the textile layer and a second layer of strain-rate sensitive material woven into the textile layer. In embodiments, the at least one layer of strain-rate sensitive material is combined into the textile layer by one or more of woven, non-woven and knitted processes. In embodiments, a single layer of strain-rate sensitive material may be attached to more than one textile layer (for example, such that the layer of strain-rate sensitive material acts to bond the two textile layers together).</p>
<p id="p-0091" num="0090">In embodiments, the strain-rate sensitive material is attached to the inside of the garment (i.e. to a surface of the fabric which, in use, faces the user's body). In such embodiments, the strain-rate sensitive material may be attached such that, in use, the strain-rate sensitive material is adjacent to (for example, in direct contact with) the user's skin. In embodiments, the strain-rate sensitive material is attached to the outside of the garment (i.e. to a surface of the fabric which, in use, faces away from the user's body). In embodiments, the strain-rate sensitive material is sandwiched between two layers of fabric, such that the strain-rate sensitive material is contained within the garment. In embodiments, the strain-rate sensitive material is not attached to fabric, but is instead free-floating within the fabric (for example, held in a pocket within the fabric).</p>
<p id="p-0092" num="0091">In embodiments the motion control system comprises first and second layers of strain-rate sensitive material. In such embodiments, it may be that the first and second layers of strain-rate sensitive material are positioned adjacent to one other (for example, such that the first and second layers of strain-rate sensitive material are in direct contact with one another). In alternative embodiments, the first layer of strain-rate sensitive substance is attached to an opposite surface of the fabric to that of the second layer of strain rate sensitive substance. In such embodiments, it may be that the fabric is sandwiched between the first and second layers of strain-rate sensitive material.</p>
<p id="p-0093" num="0092">In embodiments, the at least one layer of strain-rate sensitive material comprises a continuous sheet. In embodiments, the at least one layer of strain-rate sensitive material comprises a plurality of planar motion controlling cells. In embodiments, the plurality of motion controlling cells (and thereby also the strain-rate sensitive substance) form geometrical anisotropic patterns. It may be that the geometrical anisotropic patterns are determined by use of density mapping to map out areas of high strain of a body part for which the motion control system is configured to constrain motion. Embodiments incorporating motion controlling cells in geometrical anisotropic patterns can allow specific directional strains of the soft tissue/muscle to be targeted and reduced. Forming the motion controlling cells in geometrical anisotropic patterns can provide targeted control of motion, such that undesirable movements are constrained without impeding the physical activity of the user. In such embodiments, the strain-rate sensitive substance may provide increased control of motion in a first direction compared to a second. It will be appreciated that the directionality of the control of motion is determined by the shape of the geometrical patterns. In embodiments, at least one of the plurality of planar motion controlling cells comprises one or more of the following geometries: diagonal lines, vertical lines, horizontal lines, curved lines, squares, diamonds, triangles, hexagons, and auxetic polygons.</p>
<p id="p-0094" num="0093">In embodiments, the motion controlling cells comprise one or more locking-patterns. In embodiments, a locking-pattern comprises a spring element (for example, in the form of a chevron). In such embodiments, when the locking pattern is pulled, the chevron opens up to approximate a straight line. In embodiments where the motion controlling cells form lines (for example, horizontal or vertical lines), it may be that one or more locking-patterns are arranged on the vertical or horizontal lines, such that the motion controlling cell deviates from the line geometry to form the locking pattern. In embodiments, one or more locking patterns are positioned away from the ends of the motion controlling cell, such that the cell can be considered to deviate from the line geometry to form the locking pattern before subsequently continuing the line geometry. Alternatively or additionally, one or more locking patterns may be positioned at an end of a motion controlling cell.</p>
<p id="p-0095" num="0094">In embodiments, at least one (for example, all) of the plurality of planar motion controlling cells comprises a geometry determined by a surface tessellation process. In embodiments, the surface tessellation process comprises a Voronoi tessellation process. Performing a Voronoi tessellation process may comprise generating a plurality of notional seed points in pseudo-random locations on the surface of the wearable item. The surface is then divided into regions defined according to which of the notional seed points is the closest. Thus, any given location on the surface will sit within a region associated with the nearest of the notional seed points. The regions define an array of dissimilar irregular polygons that together cover the entirety of the surface of the wearable item. In embodiments, each of those regions comprises a motion controlling cell.</p>

<p id="p-0100" num="0099">In embodiments, the plurality of planar motion controlling cells comprises a first subset of motion controlling cells having a first geometry and a second, different subset of motion controlling cells having a second, different geometry. In such embodiments, it may be that the motion controlling cells in the first subset have different motion control properties from motion controlling cells in the second subset. In embodiments, the motion controlling cells in the first subset are located in a first zone of the wearable item and motion controlling cells in the second subset are located in a second, different zone of the wearable item. Such embodiments can provide wearable items having regions with different mechanical properties. For example, different regions may be configured to provide differing levels of support, or to resist motion in different directions. Thus, a wearable item according to such embodiments will respond differently depending on the direction and speed with which it is stretched. Providing a wearable item with multiple regions having different motion control characteristics can enable &#x201c;problem&#x201d; areas of the soft tissue with more undesirable motion to be targeted with increased damping whilst providing greater flexibility (and therefore comfort) in non-&#x201c;problem&#x201d; areas.</p>
<p id="p-0101" num="0100">In embodiments, the motion control system comprises first and second layers of strain-rate sensitive material configured to control motion from movement of one or more body parts of the user. In such embodiments, it may be that the textile layer is sandwiched in-between the first and second layers of strain-rate sensitive material. In embodiments, the motion control system comprises a further textile layer. In such embodiments, it may be that the at least one layer of strain-rate sensitive material layer is sandwiched in-between the textile layer and the further textile layer.</p>
<p id="p-0102" num="0101"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>8</b><i>a </i></figref>shows stress-strain curves at different movement speeds (1 m/s, 0.1 m/s, and 0.01 m/s) for an example SRS material according to embodiments of the present disclosure, with an original sample size of 300 mm long and 60 mm wide. It can be seen that the mechanical properties of the material are strain-rate dependent. The higher the rate of strain applied to the substance, the stiffer the material's response to the deformation is. The figure shows the response of the strain-rate sensitive material at three different tensile loadings. The stiffness of the material (indicated by the gradient of the curve) between 0 and 0.5 strain increases drastically with increased rate of deformation. This means at low strain-rates the material is flexible (facilitating donning and doffing) and at higher strain-rates is significantly stiffer (enhancing the performance of the wearable item).</p>

The area within the hysteresis loop (which corresponds to the amount of energy absorbed) is larger at the increased strain rate. The damping or energy dissipation properties also increase with quicker motions. Thus, energy control and/or dissipation increase with strain rate.</p>
<p id="p-0104" num="0103"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>9</b><i>a </i></figref>shows a chart of the energy absorption of strain rate sensitive substance according to embodiments of the present disclosure and a thermoplastic polyurethane (TPU) material. The chart shows that the strain rate sensitive substance provides increased energy absorption at higher strain rates. By contrast the TPU material provides relatively constant energy absorption at all strain rates. Providing a garment with increased energy absorption at higher strain rates according to embodiments allows for improved motion control whilst also facilitating easier donning and doffing of the garment (low strain-rates).</p>
<p id="p-0105" num="0104"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>9</b><i>b </i></figref>shows a load strain curve of an example wearable item laminated with a strain rate sensitive substance according to embodiments of the present disclosure. The example wearable item was stretched at a rate of 0.24 m/s, from an original sample size of 300 mm long by 60 mm wide. In embodiments, the wearable item comprises strain-rate sensitive material laminated onto a base garment textile. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>9</b><i>b </i></figref>illustrates the mechanical properties of an example baseline garment fabric alone, an example strain-rate sensitive material alone, and the strain-rate sensitive material laminated onto the base garment textile (referred to as a &#x201c;composite&#x201d; wearable item). The baseline garment fabric exhibits a substantially linear relationship between tensile load and applied strain. This linear relationship exists independently of strain rate. The composite wearable item requires higher loads to achieve any given strain (and thus is stiffer). In particular, the stiffness of the composite wearable item (corresponding to the gradient of the curve) between 0 and 0.5 strain is increased. Thus, the composite wearable item provides stiffer garment response/support. Laminating strain-rate sensitive material onto the base garment textile can therefore be seen to enhance the mechanical properties of the wearable item, increasing the stiffness of the wearable item. It can also be seen that the stiffness is improved in the composite wearable item compared to the strain-rate sensitive substance alone.</p>

The chart shows that the baseline fabric provides relatively constant energy absorption at all strain rates. The TPU laminated onto fabric also provides relatively constant energy absorption at all strain rates, but provides more energy absorption than the baseline fabric. The strain rate sensitive substance laminated onto fabric provides increased energy absorption at higher strain rates. Thus, the SRS material provides increased energy absorption at the increased strain rate both in isolation and when laminated onto a fabric substrate. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>10</b></figref> shows a graph of the axial acceleration of a user's hamstring muscle when wearing compressions shorts of the prior art (referred to as the &#x201c;baseline compression shorts&#x201d;) and when wearing shorts according to embodiments of the present disclosure.</p>

For both the shorts having solid laminate SRS material and diamond grid patterned SRS material, the amplitude of the muscle acceleration over the gait cycle was reduced compared to both non-compressive and compressive shorts of the prior art.</p>
<p id="p-0109" num="0108"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>13</b></figref> demonstrates the resultant accelerations of the hamstring muscle during the swing phase (between toe off and the next heel strike) of a user wearing the compression shorts garment. Baseline compression shorts are indicated by a solid line, shorts having a solid laminate layer of strain-sensitive material are indicated by a dashed line, and shorts having a Voronoi grid patterned layer of strain-sensitive material are indicated by a dotted line. For the shorts with the SRS material in the Voronoi grid pattern, the resultant peak and RMS accelerations are reduced compared to the baseline compressions shorts.</p>
<p id="p-0110" num="0109">It is thought that a body close wearable item incorporating a strain rate sensitive material can enhance the efficiency of an athlete's performance by controlling the energy of the run. During the swing phase of the gait cycle, the kinetic energy of the muscle is used to position the leg from the toe off to the next heel strike stage. During this phase, high frequency muscle motion (&#x201c;wobble&#x201d;) in circumferential and radial directions results in the inefficient use of energy and therefore inefficient energy management by the athlete. Assuming kinetic energy is proportional to the square of the velocity and considering the peak velocity of the axial muscle acceleration, then the shorts with a solid laminate layer of SRS material are preserving 24% more energy compared to the baseline running shorts. On that same basis, the shorts with a Voronoi grid patterned layer of SRS material are preserving 14% more energy compared to the baseline running shorts. This saved energy can then be transformed to useful kinetic energy during the stance stage of the next gait cycle and thereby improve the athlete's performance overall.</p>

<p id="p-0116" num="0113">Table 2 shows that, the more muscle mass the user has, the greater the reduction in acceleration provided by shorts according to the present disclosure. For each of the geometries, the resultant RMS acceleration was further reduced for the user with more muscle mass than for the user with less. This is because a greater quantity of muscle mass creates more inertia when running, causing higher deformation and therefore higher stiffness of the strain rate sensitive substance, resulting in more limited muscle movement. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>15</b></figref> shows a chart of the resultant RMS acceleration of the hamstring muscles of two users with different levels of muscle mass when wearing shorts having different geometries of planar motion controlling cells according to embodiments of the present disclosure (as listed in Table 2 above).</p>

It is believed that this difference is due to the greater mass of the quadriceps compared to the hamstring. A person's quadriceps are typically approximately 2.4 times the mass of their hamstring.</p>
<p id="p-0118" num="0115"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>16</b></figref> shows a chart comparing accelerations of a user's hamstring when wearing compression shorts of the prior art to when wearing shorts according to embodiments of the present disclosure. In particular, the graph compares baseline compression shorts with shorts having vertical, horizontal, and diagonal lines of SRS material. The graph shows that specific geometries of motion controlling cell can be used to tackle muscle accelerations in a specific direction (i.e. axial, radial, or circumferential) whilst having minimal effect on the accelerations in the other directions. Directional accelerations are generally improved more by geometries in which the pattern is aligned with the direction of muscle acceleration. Thus, a vertical lines pattern has a greater effect on the axial acceleration compared to a horizontal lines pattern. Similarly, a horizontal lines pattern has the greatest reduction in RMS muscle acceleration in the circumferential direction.</p>
<p id="p-0119" num="0116">When torque is applied to a tensile element, the direction of the principal stress in the element is at 45 degrees to the direction of the axial motion. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>16</b></figref> shows that diagonal lines yield a greater reduction in the RMS circumferential muscle acceleration compared to vertical or horizontal lines. Controlling circumferential movement could be important for reducing the risks of hamstring injury.

<p id="p-0122" num="0118">Table 3 shows that some geometries of motion controlling cells can provide significant improvements in performance whilst also enabling a reduction in the weight of the motion control system. This solid laminate provides 30% reduction in resultant RMS acceleration compared to the baseline shorts with a coverage area of 1428.73 cm<sup>2</sup>, while the Voronoi grid pattern provides 28% reduction in resultant RMS acceleration and has just 488.54 cm<sup>2 </sup>(66% less area coverage). The solid laminate is also less comfortable to wear, don and doff than the Voronoi pattern due to the additional coverage area of SRS material. This table demonstrates that, even with a significant reduction in the coverage area of SRS material, the motion control system can still perform almost as well as full coverage solid laminate, whilst also being easier to don and doff and more comfortable to wear.</p>

The graph shows that, for shorts according to the present disclosure, the magnitude of muscle accelerations in the frequency region 1-6 Hz (main body running frequency) are relatively unaffected. However, a significant reduction in magnitude is observed at higher frequencies (10-40 Hz), which correspond to muscle &#x201c;wobble&#x201d; as the athlete runs. This is beneficial, as normal running frequencies are unimpeded and only the detrimental muscle &#x201c;wobble&#x201d; frequencies are reduced.</p>

In particular, it is believed that the improved control during the landing phase of the exercise preserves energy for use in the subsequent jump.</p>

<p id="p-0131" num="0126">Table 4 shows that the effect of the SRS material is increased when the tape is applied directly to the skin, as there is no slippage and friction between a textile and the skin, which could lead to less efficient energy control. When the SRS material was applied as a solid laminate onto a garment, the resultant muscle RMS acceleration improvement over the baseline decreased to 35% compared to the 38% improvement of tape applied directly to skin. Hence, a greater improvement can be achieved with the direct application of strain-rate sensitive substance to the skin. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>22</b></figref> shows a chart of the resultant RMS acceleration of a muscle of a user of kinesiology tape according to embodiments of the present disclosure when applied directly onto the skin and when applied onto a garment (as listed in Table 4).</p>

<p id="p-0137" num="0130">Table 6 shows that both V shaped and indented tape offer significant performance improvements when compared to the baseline tape. This helps to reduce HIS through reduction of circumferential motion. When torque is applied to a tensile element, the direction of the principal stress in the element is at 45 degrees to the direction of the axial motion. Hence, reducing the stresses in the plane at 45 degrees to the muscle direction is thought to provide a greater reduction effect in the probability of hamstring injury. A significant effect was achieved with the 45-degree cross pattern (arrow patch) applied directly to the athlete skin. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>24</b></figref> shows a chart of the accelerations of a user's muscle when using kinesiology tape according to embodiments of the present disclosure (as listed in Table 6).</p>

<p id="p-0175" num="0163">In embodiments, the SRS material is extruded into filaments/fibres. In such embodiments, these SRS filaments are blended with a synthetic fibre to make an active stretch yarn blend. In embodiments, the yarn is knitted into the garment. In such embodiments, the yarn may be composed of 10-20% SRS material and 80-90% synthetic fibre. Alternatively additionally, the yarn may be woven into the garment. In such embodiments, the yarn may be composed of 40-50% SRS material and 50-60% synthetic fibre. The knits/weave can be made such that there is a greater density of SRS material in certain places (i.e. different geometries) in order to provide targeted compression.</p>
<p id="p-0176" num="0164">An optional third step of the method, represented by item <b>353</b>, comprises attaching a further layer of strain-rate sensitive material to the textile layer. In embodiments, the further layer is attached to an opposing side of the textile layer to the first layer, such that the textile layer is sandwiched in-between the two layers of strain-rate sensitive material.</p>
<p id="p-0177" num="0165">An optional fourth step of the method, represented by item <b>354</b>, comprises attaching a further textile layer to the layer of strain-rate sensitive material. In embodiments, the further textile layer is attached to an opposing side of the layer of strain-rate sensitive material to the first textile layer, such that strain-rate sensitive material layer is sandwiched in-between the two textile layers.</p>
<p id="p-0178" num="0166">Whilst the present disclosure has been described and illustrated with reference to particular embodiments, it will be appreciated by those of ordinary skill in the art that the disclosure lends itself to many different variations not specifically illustrated herein. By way of example only, certain possible variations will now be described.</p>
<p id="p-0179" num="0167">Although the present disclosure has been described embodied as a sports bra, shorts, and kinesiology tape, it will be appreciated by the skilled person that other wearable items are also possible. For example, the wearable item may comprise a sock, a sleeve (i.e. an open-ended tube), leggings, gloves, or stockings. The wearable item may, for example, comprise a shoe, with the motion control system acting as a substitute for shoelaces.</p>
<p id="p-0180" num="0168">Similarly, although the benefits of embodiments of the present disclosure have been described primarily in a sporting context, it will be appreciated that garments providing active control of the motion of body parts also find use in other settings (for example, as medical compression garments for use in physical therapy or as shapewear).</p>
<p id="p-0181" num="0169">Although a number of geometries of motion controlling cells have been described, it will be appreciated that other geometries not explicitly described are also possible and, in some cases, desirable. It will be understood by the skilled person that the specific geometries of the motion controlling cells are tailored to the desired constraints to be placed on movement of the user's body parts (i.e. extent to which motion in any given direction is to be controlled or not).</p>
<p id="p-0182" num="0170">The present disclosure also provides a wearable item comprising a layer of active material, wherein the wearable item comprises a body-close wearable item which, when worn by a user, at least a part of the wearable item is positioned adjacent to the body of the user, and wherein the layer of active material comprises at least one layer of strain-rate sensitive material configured to control motion of one or more body parts of the user.</p>
<p id="p-0183" num="0171">It will be appreciated that an active material is a material which has dynamic (for example, changing in response to strain rate) stiffness and/or damping properties.</p>
<p id="p-0184" num="0172">Where in the foregoing description, integers or elements are mentioned which have known, obvious or foreseeable equivalents, then such equivalents are herein incorporated as if individually set forth. Reference should be made to the claims for determining the true scope of the present disclosure, which should be construed so as to encompass any such equivalents. It will also be appreciated by the reader that integers or features of the disclosure that are described as preferable, advantageous, convenient or the like are optional and do not limit the scope of the independent claims. Moreover, it is to be understood that such optional integers or features, whilst of possible benefit in some embodiments of the disclosure, may not be desirable, and may therefore be absent, in other embodiments.</p>
