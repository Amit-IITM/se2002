<heading id="h-0002" level="1">BACKGROUND</heading>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">Coaches of sports that require significant equipment to be used during the practice need to carry multiple bags of equipment, have multiple people assist in carrying equipment to the practice site, or have to take multiple trips to bring the equipment to the practice site. For example, a soccer practice generally requires multiple soccer balls, cones or other boundary/goal marking devices, pinneys, water, and other items to be carried to the practice site. These manners of facilitating a practice is generally inefficient and time consuming.</p>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">Accordingly, there is a need in the art for a coaching bag that organizes and retains all the items needed to run a practice in a manner that can be easily carried by one person.</p>
