<heading id="h-0005" level="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION</heading>
<p id="p-0021" num="0020">It is to be understood that the figures and descriptions provided herein may have been simplified to illustrate aspects that are relevant for a clear understanding of the herein described processes and devices, while eliminating, for the purpose of clarity, other aspects that may be found in typical processes and devices. Those of ordinary skill in the pertinent art may recognize that other elements or steps may be desirable or necessary to implement the processes and devices described herein. Because such elements and steps are well known in the art, and because they do not facilitate a better understanding of the present disclosure, a discussion of such elements and steps may not be provided herein. However, the present disclosure is deemed to inherently include all such elements, variations, and modifications to the described aspects that would be known to those of ordinary skill in the pertinent art.</p>
<p id="p-0022" num="0021">It will be readily understood that the components of the present invention, as generally described and illustrated in the figures herein, may be realized in a variety of different configurations. Thus, the following detailed description of certain exemplary embodiments, as represented in the attached figures, is not intended to limit the scope of the invention as claimed, but is merely representative of selected illustrative embodiments of the invention. The usage of the phrases &#x201c;example embodiments&#x201d;, &#x201c;some embodiments&#x201d;, or other similar language throughout this specification refers to the fact that the feature or characteristic described may be included in at least one embodiment of the present invention, and do not necessarily all refer to the same embodiment or group of embodiments.</p>
<p id="p-0023" num="0022">A variety of embodiments will now be described. These embodiments are provided as teaching examples and do not limit the scope of the invention. Although specific details of the embodiments are presented, these embodiments may be modified by changing, supplementing, or eliminating many of these details.</p>
<p id="p-0024" num="0023">The cake covers <b>10</b>, <b>12</b> are preferably made to protect standard sized birthday cakes <b>15</b>, <b>17</b> having conventional shapes, for example circular or rectangular cakes, and conventional heights, such as six inches or four inches tall. In addition, the top surfaces <b>20</b>, <b>22</b> of the protective cake covers <b>10</b>, <b>12</b> are also configured to serve as holders for birthday candles, such as candles that can display a number of years by using that number of individual birthday candles <b>25</b>, or larger individual candles <b>27</b> in the form of numeric digits. The numeric digits of the candles <b>27</b> range from 0 to 9, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b>C</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0025" num="0024">In general, the covers <b>10</b>, <b>12</b> may be sized with dimensions chosen to accommodate cakes <b>15</b>, <b>17</b> of a variety of standard or other sizes and shapes. The covers <b>10</b>, <b>12</b> are preferably made of a transparent material that is dish washer safe, such as clear glass or plastic. Other aspects of the covers <b>10</b>, <b>12</b> may be based on or determined by the size and shape of the respective cakes <b>15</b>, <b>17</b> being covered.</p>
<p id="p-0026" num="0025">For example, a cake cover <b>10</b> may be shaped and sized to cover a round cake <b>15</b>. Common dimensions of such a cake commonly include a circular plan 14&#x2033; (inches) in diameter&#xd7;7&#x2033; high, including a generous amount of icing. However, round cakes <b>15</b> may commonly have a diameter in the range of 5 inches to 25 inches, and may be cut to provide 6 to 195 slices or servings, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>1</b>D, <b>2</b>D</figref>, for example. A rectangular cake may be cut to provide 12 to 144 slices. The cake <b>15</b>, <b>17</b> may be cut while remaining on the base plate <b>42</b>, <b>45</b>, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>1</b>D, <b>2</b>D</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0027" num="0026">Embodiments of the cake covers <b>10</b>, <b>12</b> may be sized accordingly to cover the iced cake plus a desired clearance so the cover does not touch the cake. The cake covers <b>10</b>, <b>12</b> should comprise a transparent plastic or glass cover. The covers <b>10</b>, <b>12</b> each have respective horizontal tops <b>11</b>, <b>13</b> and vertical sidewalls <b>14</b>, <b>16</b>. The couplings between the tops <b>11</b>, <b>13</b> and sidewalls <b>14</b>, <b>16</b> may be permanent, as shows in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>1</b>B, <b>2</b>B, and <b>2</b>C</figref>. Alternatively, the couplings between the tops <b>11</b>, <b>13</b> and sidewalls <b>14</b>, <b>16</b> may be temporary, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>1</b>E and <b>2</b>E</figref>. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>1</b>E and <b>2</b>E</figref> show the covers <b>10</b>, <b>12</b> removed from the sidewalls <b>14</b>, <b>16</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0028" num="0027">The respective top surfaces <b>20</b>, <b>22</b> of the tops <b>11</b>, <b>13</b> have respective indentations <b>30</b>, <b>35</b> for receiving the bottom end of the small candles <b>25</b> and supporting them vertically in place. The indentations <b>30</b>, <b>35</b> may be in the form of circular cylinders deep enough to firmly support candles <b>25</b> inserted into them, such as a quarter inch deep although other depths may be used without changing the scope of the claims. Moreover, the indentations <b>30</b>, <b>35</b> may be configured in any desired arrangement, such as concentric circles in a circular cover <b>10</b> for covering a circular cake <b>15</b>, or a rectangular shape or grid in a rectangular cover <b>12</b> for covering a rectangular cake <b>17</b>. The covers <b>10</b>, <b>12</b> protect the respective cakes <b>15</b>, <b>17</b> from dripping wax from the candles <b>25</b>, and also from airborne particles landing on the cake, such as a spray or aerosol of saliva droplets created when blowing out burning candles, or when coughing or sneezing in the vicinity of the cakes. The covers <b>10</b>, <b>12</b> are then removed from the respective cakes <b>15</b>, <b>17</b> before they are sliced and served. In addition to melted wax from the candles <b>25</b>, the covers <b>10</b>, <b>12</b> prevent germs and other contaminants from landing on the cakes <b>15</b>, <b>17</b> before they are served.</p>
<p id="p-0029" num="0028"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>1</b>A and <b>1</b>B</figref> show top and side views, respectively, of an exemplary embodiment suitable for covering a round cake <b>10</b>. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b>A</figref> shows one embodiment of indentations <b>30</b>, <b>32</b> or candle holder positions in the top surface <b>20</b> of the cake cover <b>10</b>, although other configurations may be used without changing the scope of the claims. As shown, two large rectangular indentations <b>32</b> are disposed symmetrically beside the center of the top surface <b>20</b> of the cake cover <b>10</b> for holding numeral-shaped candles <b>27</b>. There is also a plurality of smaller indentations <b>30</b> for holding birthday candles, disposed in a plurality of positions configured for easy placement of candles <b>25</b> in symmetrical patterns. The indentations <b>30</b> are placed in three concentric rings with centers coinciding with the center of the top surface <b>20</b> of the cover <b>10</b>. The outermost ring has eight positions 45&#xb0; apart; the next ring has 12 positions 30&#xb0; apart, and the innermost ring has 20 positions 18&#xb0; apart. Of course, other positions may alternatively or additionally be used. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b>B</figref> is a side view of the same cake cover <b>10</b>. The cover <b>10</b> has a width and height configured to fit over a round cake <b>15</b>, with an inside diameter larger than the diameter of the cake, and a height greater than the height of the cake, so the cover does not touch the cake. The cover <b>10</b> can be configured and manufactured to provide any convenient spacing between the cover and the cake <b>15</b>. For example, the cover <b>10</b> can be sized to provide a half inch clearance around the side and top of the cake <b>15</b>, such as a cover 15&#x2033; in diameter and 7.5&#x2033; tall that covers a round cake 14&#x2033; in diameter and 7&#x2033; tall to provide a 0.5&#x2033; clearance. Of course, other dimensions of the cover <b>10</b> may be used to provide different clearances, or to cover cakes of other sizes, or both.</p>
<p id="p-0030" num="0029"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>2</b>A, <b>2</b>B, and <b>2</b>C</figref> show top, front, and side views, respectively, of an exemplary embodiment suitable for covering a rectangular cake <b>17</b>. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b>A</figref> shows one embodiment of indentations <b>35</b>, <b>37</b> or candle holder positions in the top surface <b>22</b> of the cake cover <b>12</b>, although other configurations may be used without changing the scope of the claims. As shown, two large rectangular indentations <b>37</b> are disposed symmetrically left and right of the center of the top surface <b>22</b> of the cake cover <b>12</b> for holding numeral-shaped candles <b>27</b>. There is also a plurality of smaller indentations <b>35</b> for holding birthday candles <b>25</b>, disposed in a plurality of positions configured for easy placement of candles in symmetrical patterns. The indentations <b>35</b> are placed in two concentric rectangles with centers coinciding with the center of the top surface <b>22</b> of the cover <b>12</b>. The outermost rectangle has 32 indentations <b>35</b> or candle holder positions evenly spaced along the circumference of the outermost rectangle, while the innermost rectangle has <b>32</b> indentations or candle holder positions evenly spaced along the circumference of the innermost rectangle. The embodiment illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b>A</figref> also has three positions or indentations <b>35</b> disposed symmetrically along a centerline of the cover <b>12</b> within the inner rectangle of indentations or candle holder positions. The cover <b>12</b> has length, width, and height dimensions configured to fit over a rectangular cake <b>17</b>, so the cover does not touch the cake. The cover <b>12</b> can be configured to provide any convenient spacing between the cover and the cake <b>17</b>. For example, the cover <b>12</b> can be sized to provide a half inch clearance around the sides and top of the cake <b>17</b>, such as a cover 18&#x2033; long, 12.25&#x2033; wide, and 6.5&#x2033; tall that covers a rectangular cake 17&#x2033; long, 11.25&#x2033; wide, and 6&#x2033; tall, thus providing a 0.5&#x2033; clearance. Of course, other dimensions of the cover <b>12</b> may be used to provide different clearances, or to cover cakes of other sizes, or both.</p>
<p id="p-0031" num="0030">In embodiments, a cover <b>12</b> for a cake <b>17</b> as described in the foregoing may include or be provided with a base plate <b>45</b> that has in its top surface <b>50</b> a shallow groove <b>53</b> or ridge <b>55</b> in the shape of the bottom of the wall(s) of the cover <b>12</b>, configured to receive the bottom edge of the cover and prevent it from sliding, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>2</b>F and <b>2</b>G</figref>. Parts illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b>G</figref> which correspond to parts illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b>F</figref> have the same reference numeral as in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b>F</figref> with the addition of the suffix &#x201c;a&#x201d; in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b>G</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0032" num="0031"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>3</b>A and <b>3</b>B</figref> show top and side views, respectively, of an exemplary embodiment suitable for covering a round cupcake <b>57</b>. In this embodiment, the cover <b>60</b> comprises top and bottom parts <b>62</b>, <b>65</b>. In an exemplary operation, a cupcake <b>57</b> is placed in the bottom part <b>65</b>, and the top part <b>62</b> is then placed over the cupcake atop the bottom part. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b>A</figref> shows one embodiment of the position of a single indentation <b>67</b> or candle holder position in the top part <b>62</b> of the cover <b>60</b> for the cupcake <b>57</b>, configured to hold only one birthday candle <b>25</b> in the center of the top part, although other configurations may be used without changing the scope of the claims. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b>B</figref> is a side view of the same cover <b>60</b> for a cupcake <b>57</b>. The cover <b>60</b> has a width and height configured to fit over a round cupcake <b>57</b>, with an inside diameter where the top and bottom parts <b>62</b>, <b>65</b> meet, larger than the diameter of the cupcake, and a height greater than the height of the cupcake, so the cover does not touch the cupcake. The cover <b>60</b> can be configured and manufactured to provide any convenient spacing between the cover and the cupcake <b>57</b>. For example, the cover <b>60</b> can be sized to provide a half inch clearance around the side and top of the cupcake <b>57</b> when iced, such as a cover 3&#x2033; in diameter and 3&#x2033; tall that covers a round cupcake 2&#x2033; in diameter and 2.5&#x2033; tall to provide a 0.5&#x2033; clearance. Of course, other dimensions of the cover <b>60</b> may be used to provide different clearances, or to cover cupcakes of other sizes, or both.</p>
