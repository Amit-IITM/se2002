<heading id="h-0001" level="1">FIELD OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0002" num="0001">The present disclosure is concerned with an electrically operated assembly, the assembly comprising a handle housing defining an inner cavity, a connector for repeatably attaching and detaching a head to and from the assembly, and a motor for operating the assembly. The present disclosure is further concerned with an electrically operated personal-care implement comprising such assembly.</p>
<heading id="h-0002" level="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">Personal care implements, like toothbrushes, are well known in the art. Generally, tufts of bristles for cleaning teeth are attached to a bristle carrier or mounting surface of a brush head intended for insertion into a user's oral cavity. A handle is usually attached to the head, which handle is held by the user during brushing.</p>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">Electrically operated toothbrushes exhibit the advantage that they assist users during brushing and may facilitate improved cleansing of the teeth and gums, in particular in hard-to-reach areas in the mouth.</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">Toothbrushes performing a vibration action usually have a motor with an eccentric weight located in the handle housing and allow vibrations to be transmitted to the head. The motor is usually fixed on a chassis and vibrates the entire handle (including the chassis) and therewith also the brush head that is attached to the handle. However, the amplitude of vibrations at the brush head depends on the way the user holds the handle: With a softer grip, the handle can vibrate more extensively and therefore the user feels more vibrations on the teeth. However, if the user holds the handle tightly, vibrations will be significantly damped, and the brush head will vibrate less during use.</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">Consequently, performance of a vibration toothbrush, including in-mouth perception during use is highly dependent on the user's behavior. Also, the motor is usually mounted onto a chassis, the chassis being embedded inside the handle housing, while the brush head is mounted onto the handle housing. The additional chassis-housing interface can further absorb vibrations which leads to further losses of vibration energy.</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">Further, vibrating toothbrushes are known comprising a motor located within the neck of the toothbrush head close to the bristle carrier to allow the vibrations to be directly transmitted to the head. However, such configuration requires the neck of the toothbrush head to be relatively bulky and large in cross section to allow accommodation of the motor. Such bulky neck, however, impedes good maneuverability of the brush head during brushing and hinders sufficient reach to the back molars. Also, having the motor located within the brush neck requires the neck to be configured as a straight tube to enable insertion of motor components, which again hinders reachability of back molars.</p>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">The present disclosure provides a handle for an electrically operated personal-care implement, e.g. a handle for a toothbrush, which overcomes at least one of the above-mentioned drawbacks, in particular which provides reliable vibration modes during use while facilitating good maneuverability. The present disclosure also provides an electrically operated personal-care implement comprising such handle.</p>

<heading id="h-0005" level="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0016" num="0015">The electrically operated assembly which is suitable to be used in connection with an electrically operated personal-care implement comprises a handle housing defining an inner cavity, a connector for repeatably attaching and detaching a head to and from the assembly, and a motor for operating the assembly. The motor which may comprise an eccentric weight is accommodated/mounted in a recess provided within the connector to allow for maximal generation of vibrations.</p>
<p id="p-0017" num="0016">The vibrations are transferrable via the connector to the head without significant absorption by the housing. In other words, as the motor comprising the eccentric weight may be mounted directly within the connector to which the head is attached, the vibrations generated by the motor can be directly guided to the head. Even if the housing is tightly grasped by a user, the vibrations will not be absorbed by a chassis or housing, but can be freely and directly transferred to the head.</p>
<p id="p-0018" num="0017">Thereby, in-mouth perception and cleaning performance during brushing can be enhanced. In contrast to common brush executions having a vibrating function (the motor vibrating the entire handle and therewith the head), the assembly according to the present disclosure allows vibrations to be effectively transferred, independent from the way the handle is hold by the user; the amplitude of the vibrations is less damped as the motor is located within the connector, and therewith in close proximity to the head/bristle carrier.</p>
<p id="p-0019" num="0018">Further, in contrast to vibrating toothbrushes having a motor located within the neck of a toothbrush head requiring a large/thick and straight neck design, the personal-care implement according to the present disclosure allows for a slim and curved neck design, thereby not compromising on in-mouth maneuverability and comfort during brushing.</p>
<p id="p-0020" num="0019">The connector may have a longitudinal length extension comprising a proximal end closest to the head attachable to the connector, and a distal end, the distal end being opposite the proximal end. For example, the recess accommodating the motor may be located at the distal end of the connector, i.e. on the opposite side of the head.</p>
<p id="p-0021" num="0020">As used herein &#x201c;personal-care implement&#x201d; refers to any implement which can be utilized for the purposes of personal hygiene. Some suitable examples include toothbrushes, flossers, toothpicks, razors, shavers, and trimmers. For example, the personal-care implement may be battery-operated and may comprise a battery located within the inner cavity of the handle housing. The electrically operated personal-care implement comprising such electrically operated assembly and a head may be an electrically operated oral-care implement, for example a toothbrush. The head may be repeatedly attachable to and detachable from the electrically operated assembly/handle, e.g. via a snap-fit locking mechanism thereby providing sufficiently strong connection and stability between the head and the handle to enable a user to perform, e.g. a brushing action.</p>
<p id="p-0022" num="0021">While the electrically operated assembly/handle of the personal-care implement may be adapted for use over a longer period of time as compared to common implements, like manual toothbrushes which are discarded after about three months of use, the relatively cheap head/brush refill can be exchanged on a regular basis, e.g. after about three months. This provides a cost-efficient and environmentally sustainable personal-care implement providing both, high quality handle solutions as well as cost saving opportunities for the consumer as only the head has to be exchanged/re-purchased and not the electrically operated assembly/handle.</p>
<p id="p-0023" num="0022">The connector of the electrically operated assembly is at least partially made from a material having an e-modulus being higher than the e-modulus of the material from which the handle housing is made. A connector being made from a material having a higher e-modulus provides improved stability, stiffness and a secure connection between the connector and the head, in particular if high pressure and high lateral forces are applied during use of the implement.</p>
<p id="p-0024" num="0023">In other words, the connector can be made from a material which is different from the material from which the handle housing is made. Depending on the intended use, the most suitable materials can be selected for both, the connector and the handle housing.</p>
<p id="p-0025" num="0024">To provide the connector with improved mechanical properties in terms of stiffness and resistance against abrasion and wear out (e.g. due to abrasive toothpaste accumulating at the brush head connection), the connector may be made (e.g. molded) from a fiber-reinforced material, preferably from a glass fiber-reinforced plastic material. Due to its high stiffness, glass fiber-reinforced material is suitable for mounting the motor including the eccentric weight within the recess of the connector by means of press-fitting. As glass fiber-reinforced material shows no to very limited relaxation over time, resulting in vibrations being efficiently transmittable over the usual life-time of the implement.</p>
<p id="p-0026" num="0025">For example, the material from which the connector is at least partially made may have an e-modulus of at least 4000 MPa, for example from about 4000 MPa to about 20000 MPa, or form about 10000 MPa to about 11000 MPa, or about 10400 MPa. A connector having such modulus of elasticity can be provided if the connector is at least partially molded from a hard plastic material, e.g. from a fiber-reinforced material, for example a glass fiber-reinforced material.</p>
<p id="p-0027" num="0026">Generally, the fiber-reinforced material may comprise a polymer as a base material, and fibers selected from the group consisting of inorganic particulates, glass fibers, carbon fibers, aramid fibers, basalt fibers, wood fibers, and any combinations thereof. Glass fibers may improve strength, elasticity and heat resistance of the polymer base material. Carbon and aramid fibers may improve elasticity, tensile and compression strength of the polymer base material. Wood fibers may improve flexural strength, tensile modulus, and tensile strength of the polymer base material. Inorganic particulates may improve isotropic shrinkage, abrasion and compression strength of the polymer base material.</p>
<p id="p-0028" num="0027">The fiber-reinforced material may comprise from about 10 wt % to about 50 wt %, or from about 25 wt % to about 35 wt %, or about 30 wt % fibers. The connector may be made from a glass fiber-reinforced polymer material comprising about 30 wt % glass fiber. The polymer base material in which the fibers may be embedded may be a polyamide or polybutylene terephthalate, polyethylene terephthalate, or a combination of polybutylene terephthalate and polyethylene terephthalate. A fiber-reinforced material comprising from about 25 wt % to about 35 wt % glass fiber, wherein the glass fibers are embedded in either polyamide as a base material, or, alternatively in a base material comprising a mixture of polybutylene terephthalate and polyethylene terephthalate may have an e-modulus of about 10400 MPa. Such glass fiber-reinforced material shows superior molding properties while providing sufficient stiffness to the connector, as well as resistance against abrasion and wear out.</p>
<p id="p-0029" num="0028">The glass fibers embedded in the polymer material may provide significantly increased stiffness, wear resistance and integrity to the polymer material forming the connector. For personal implements, for example oral-care handles from which the heads are getting frequently detached and re-attached, such material provides the connector with wear resistance allowing the handle to be used over a longer period of time. Long lasting connector properties are in particular important for toothbrushes as the head and handle often get soiled with slurry and toothpaste containing abrasive particles. If the connector material is not sufficiently resistant against abrasives, the abrasives may grind/sand down material of the connector, thereby changing the outer geometry of the connector. As a result, the connector may lose its function, and/or its ability to securely hold the head in place during use, e.g. during brushing.</p>
<p id="p-0030" num="0029">As glass fiber-reinforced plastic materials have typically a less aesthetic appearance and are relatively expensive, the handle housing can be made from a material being more aesthetically appealing and/or cost effective. For example, the connector may be at least partially molded from a fiber-reinforced material, while the handle housing may be manufactured from relatively cheap (standard) plastic material, e.g. polypropylene, acrylic styrene acrylonitrile, or copolyester, or from a metal material, for example stainless steel or aluminium. Such materials are highly durable and allow for slim product designs. A glass fiber-reinforced material forming the connector has a higher e-modulus than the standard plastic material used to manufacture the housing.</p>
<p id="p-0031" num="0030">For example, the handle housing may be made from a hard plastic material, e.g., polypropylene, acrylic styrene acrylonitrile (ASA), or copolyester, or from a metal material, for example stainless steel or aluminium. Such materials are highly durable and allow for slim product designs. For example, if ASA is used as a material/base material for the handle housing, a material with an e-modulus of about 2500 MPa may be provided. The hard plastic material (e.g. ASA) may be at least partially over-molded by a thermoplastic elastomer (TPE) providing the handle housing with improved aesthetic and/or gripping properties.</p>
<p id="p-0032" num="0031">The handle housing may have a proximal end and a distal end. The proximal end is defined as the end being closest to a head which is repeatably attachable to and detachable from the electrically operated assembly/handle. The distal end is opposite the proximal end.</p>
<p id="p-0033" num="0032">The connector for repeatably attaching and detaching the head to and from the electrically operated assembly may be partially accommodated within the inner cavity at the proximal end of the handle housing. In other words, the handle housing may comprise an opening at its proximal end, and the connector for repeatedly attaching and detaching the head to and from the electrically operated assembly may extend through said opening.</p>
<p id="p-0034" num="0033">As discussed above, the connector comprises a recess in which the motor, optionally with the eccentric weight, is (entirely) accommodated. For example, the motor comprising the eccentric weight may be mounted within the connector by means of press-fitting. The connector recess may be provided at the side/end of the connector which is located within the inner cavity of the handle housing. In other words, while the connector extends into the inner cavity of the handle housing at its proximal end, the head can be attached to the connector geometry extending outside of the handle housing.</p>
<p id="p-0035" num="0034">The motor comprising the eccentric weight may be located at the end opposite the head, inside the connector recess to allow for maximal generation of vibrations. The vibrations are transferrable via the connector to the head without significant absorption by the housing. In other words, as the motor comprising the eccentric weight may be mounted directly within the connector to which the head is attached, the vibrations generated by the motor can be directly guided to the head. Even if the housing is tightly grasped by a user, the vibrations will not be absorbed by a chassis or housing, but can be freely and directly transferred to the head.</p>
<p id="p-0036" num="0035">In-mouth perception and cleaning performance during brushing is enhanced. In contrast to common brush executions having a vibrating function (the motor vibrating the entire handle and therewith the head), the handle according to the present disclosure allows vibrations to be effectively transferred, independent from the way the handle is hold by the user; the amplitude of the vibrations is less damped as the motor is located in close proximity to the connector, and therewith with the head and bristle carrier.</p>
<p id="p-0037" num="0036">Further, in contrast to vibrating toothbrushes having a motor located within the neck of a toothbrush head requiring a large/thick and straight neck design, the personal-care implement according to the present disclosure allows for a slim and curved neck design, thereby not compromising on in-mouth maneuverability and comfort during brushing.</p>
<p id="p-0038" num="0037">The connector may define an overall length extension extending along a longitudinal connector axis. The overall length extension may be composed of a sub-length (Li) extending within the inner cavity of the handle housing, and a sub-length (Lo) extending outside of the handle housing. The ratio of the sub-length (Li) extending within the inner cavity to the sub-length (Lo) extending outside of the housing may be from about 1 to about 1.7, preferably from about 1 to about 1.5. Such ratio provides the connector with sufficient stability and bending stiffness to securely hold the head during use of the implement, while providing sufficient space for mounting the motor with the eccentric weight within the recess. Also, such ratio facilitates superior transmission of vibrations generated by the motor along the connector axis to the head.</p>
<p id="p-0039" num="0038">For example, the overall length extension (Lc) of the connector may be from about 35 mm to about 45 mm, or from about 39 mm to about 43 mm. The sub-length extension (Li) of the connector which is accommodated within the inner cavity of the housing may be from about 20 mm to about 25 mm, or from about 22 mm to about 24 mm. The sub-length extension (Lo) of the connector which is outside of the housing may be from about 15 mm to about 20 mm, or from about 17 mm to about 19 mm.</p>
<p id="p-0040" num="0039">The part/extension of the connector which is outside of the housing is the part to which the head can be attached. A relatively short connector head interface geometry allows for a slim neck design&#x2014;a critical feature for superior maneuverability during use of the implement. Further, the neck design can also be curved, facilitating reachability of back molars during brushing.</p>
<p id="p-0041" num="0040">A ratio of an overall length extension of the handle housing extending along a longitudinal housing axis to an overall length extension of the connector extending along a longitudinal connector axis may be from about 2.5 to about 4.5, or from about 3.0 to about 3.5.</p>
<p id="p-0042" num="0041">In other words, compared to the overall length of the handle housing, the connector may be relatively short, yet highly durable due to the relatively high e-modulus, and forms only a relatively small part in relation to the handle housing. As the connector is relatively small and may, therefore, only contain critical geometries for a tight fit to the head and for tight fixation of the motor, the geometrical tolerances from a molding process can be better controlled. Tighter overall tolerances can be realized leading to better fit of the critical components (motor and head). A sufficient fit between the connector and head is a prerequisite for an efficient transmission of vibration energy.</p>
<p id="p-0043" num="0042">For example, the overall length extension (Lh) of the handle housing extending along the longitudinal housing axis may be from about 120 mm to about 150 mm, or from about 125 mm to about 145 mm, or from about 130 mm to about 140 mm, or about 130 mm to about 135 mm.</p>
<p id="p-0044" num="0043">The connector may comprise a spring-loaded snap element in the region outside of the handle housing. The spring-loaded snap element may provide a snap-fit locking mechanism to ensure sufficiently strong connection and stability between the head and the electrically operated assembly/toothbrush handle, e.g. to enable a user to perform a brushing action. The connector may have an outer lateral surface and a recess therein, the recess forming a cavity within the connector. Within the cavity a spring-loaded ball-snap element may be provided. The spring-loaded ball-snap element may comprise a ball and a spring, the spring applying a radial force onto the ball in a direction towards the outer lateral surface of the connector.</p>
<p id="p-0045" num="0044">In the following a radial force is defined by a force applied in a direction being substantially perpendicular to the longitudinal length extension of the connector. The spring may apply a force onto the ball and may push the ball outwards so that the ball extends slightly beyond the outer lateral surface of the connector. An inner wall of a hollow portion provided inside of the head may comprise a recess for receiving the ball of the spring-loaded ball element. Once the head is snap-fitted onto the connector, the head can be fixed on the connector in an axial direction. In other words, the connector may allow for easy attachment/detachment of the head to and from the connector. The user can attach the head to the handle by a simple linear motion.</p>
<p id="p-0046" num="0045">Further, the ball-snap may provide a precise fixation of the head, and a distinct haptic feedback may be given to the user that the head is snapped-on securely. In other words, the user can recognize once the ball engages into the recess in the inner wall of the hollow portion of the head. The head can be easily removed, i.e. without performing a synchronized action with other elements/unlocking mechanisms.</p>
<p id="p-0047" num="0046">The head is fixed on the electrically operated assembly/handle until a specific/predetermined pull-off force is applied. The connection between the head and connector is sufficiently strong enabling well-coordinated brushing techniques. The head does not get loosened from the handle and does not twist aside during brushing.</p>
<p id="p-0048" num="0047">The ball and/or the spring of the spring-loaded ball element may be made from stainless steel. While typical snap elements comprise a spring element made from plastic that shows relaxation and aging effects over time, a stainless-steel spring shows a constant spring rate over time, also under extended use conditions (e.g. temperature). A spring-loaded ball element made from stainless steel may provide long-lasting, reliable fixation of the head on the connector/handle.</p>
<p id="p-0049" num="0048">The spring-loaded ball element may be fixed in the cavity of the connector by a press-fitting process and/or gluing.</p>
<p id="p-0050" num="0049">The connector may comprise a first substantially cylindrical section and a second substantially cylindrical section, wherein the first and the second cylindrical sections may be connected by an at least partially conically shaped section. The first substantially cylindrical section, the at least partially conically shaped section and the second substantially cylindrical section may be arranged in consecutive order and may define the longitudinal length extension of the connector. The first and the second substantially cylindrical sections may be placed off-center with respect to the longitudinal length extension of the connector.</p>
<p id="p-0051" num="0050">In the following, a substantially cylindrical section is defined by a three-dimensional body having a longitudinal length extension and a cross-sectional area extending substantially perpendicular to the longitudinal length extension. The cross-sectional area has a shape being substantially constant along the longitudinal length extension. Since the connector may be manufactured by an injection molding process, a substantially cylindrical section also comprises sections/bodies which have a slight draft angle of up to about 2&#xb0;. In other words, a substantially cylindrical section also comprises a section/body which tapers slightly by up to about 2&#xb0; towards a proximal end which is closest to the head once the head is attached to the connector.</p>
<p id="p-0052" num="0051">The cross-sectional area may have any shape, for example substantially circular, ellipsoid, rectangular, semi-circular, circular with a flattening portion, convex or concave. The cross-sectional area may have the shape of a polygon, for example of a square or triangle. The outer lateral surface circumventing the cylinder along its length extension can be defined as being composed of straight lines which are substantially parallel with respect to the longitudinal length extension of the cylinder.</p>
<p id="p-0053" num="0052">The head of the personal-care implement has a distal end and a proximal end, the proximal end being defined as the end closest to the handle. The proximal end of the head may comprise a hollow portion for receiving a part of the connector, for example, the second substantially cylindrical section, the at least partially conically shaped section and a part of the first substantially cylindrical section. The hollow portion of the head may have an inner wall with a geometry/contour which corresponds to the outer geometry/contour of the part of the connector to be inserted into the hollow portion of the head.</p>
<p id="p-0054" num="0053">The eccentric arrangement/off-center positioning of the substantially cylindrical sections of the connector enables precise positioning of the head on the handle. The geometric position of the head can be clearly defined. As the handle comprises the connector at a proximal end being closest to the head, the eccentric/off-center arrangement of the two substantially cylindrical sections may act as a guidance element when a user attaches the head to the handle. In other words, the two substantially cylindrical sections may allow for accurate fitting between the head and the handle. Further, the eccentric/off-center arrangement of the two substantially cylindrical sections may provide an anti-twist protection for the head on the handle during brushing, for example if a lateral force is applied onto the head.</p>
<p id="p-0055" num="0054">The proximal end of the handle housing may comprise a chamfered surface. Such chamfered surface may provide the personal/oral-care implement with additional anti-twist protection during use. The chamfered surface and a cross-sectional area of the handle may define an angle a from about 15&#xb0; to about 30&#xb0;, or from about 18&#xb0; to about 28&#xb0;, or about 25&#xb0;. Said cross-sectional area is defined by an area extending substantially perpendicular to the longitudinal length extension of the handle. Surprisingly, it has been found out that such angled/chamfered surface provides superior anti-twist protection. Furthermore, the angled/chamfered surface allows for draining-off fluids, like toothpaste slurry and saliva, after use of the personal/oral-care implement, thereby preventing accumulation of such fluids over time.</p>
<p id="p-0056" num="0055">The handle housing may accommodate an energy source, e.g., a battery, and/or other means for operating the personal-care implement. The handle housing may comprise a switch assembly connected to a Printed Circuit Board Assembly (PCBA) for activating the energy source, e.g. for switching the electrically operated personal-care implement to an ON/OFF status. Via the PCBA electrical communication between the battery as an example for an energy source, and the motor can be provided.</p>
<p id="p-0057" num="0056">The handle may comprise a magnetic/ferromagnetic plate placed inside the handle housing. The plate may allow for hygienic storage of the personal-care implement by magnetically attaching the handle to a magnetic holder, e.g. provided at a wall. If the personal-care implement is a toothbrush, remaining water, toothpaste slurry and saliva can drain off from the brush. The implement can dry relatively quickly. Consequently, bacteria growth can significantly be reduced, thereby rendering the personal/oral-care implement more hygienic. In contrast to a common toothbrushes being stored in a toothbrush beaker where drained fluids get collected and accumulated at the bottom of the beaker, the brush according to the present disclosure is exposed to wet conditions over a significantly shorter period of time.</p>
<p id="p-0058" num="0057">The magnetic holder may have the form of a flat disk attachable to a wall. Such flat disk may represent an easy to clean surface. Further, a user just needs to bring the personal/oral-care implement in close proximity to the magnetic holder, and then the personal/oral-care implement gets attached automatically. No precise positioning or threading as with common toothbrush holders is required. If the magnetic properties are merely provided in the handle, and not in the head, the head portion cannot accidentally be attached to the magnetic holder, thereby reducing the risk that the magnetic holder gets soiled.</p>
<p id="p-0059" num="0058">If the personal-care implement is a toothbrush, tooth cleaning elements, e.g. bundle of filaments forming one or a plurality of tufts, may be attached to the toothbrush head by means of a hot tufting process. One method of manufacturing the head with tufts of filaments embedded in the head may comprise the following steps: In a first step, tufts are formed by providing a desired amount of filaments. In a second step, the tufts are placed into a mold cavity so that ends of the filaments which are supposed to be attached to the head extend into said cavity. The opposite ends of the filaments not extending into said cavity may be either end-rounded or non-end-rounded. For example, the filaments may be not end-rounded in case the filaments are tapered filaments having a pointed tip. In a third step the head is formed around the ends of the filaments extending into the mold cavity by an injection molding process, thereby anchoring the tufts in the head.</p>
<p id="p-0060" num="0059">Alternatively, the tufts may be anchored by forming a first part of the head&#x2014;a so called &#x201c;sealplate&#x201d;&#x2014;around the ends of the filaments extending into the mold cavity by an injection molding process before the remaining part of the head is formed. Before starting the injection molding process the ends of the tufts extending into the mold cavity may be optionally melted or fusion-bonded to join the filaments together in a fused mass or ball so that the fused masses or balls are located within the cavity. The tufts may be held in the mold cavity by a mold bar having blind holes that correspond to the desired position of the tufts on the finished head of the oral-care implement. In other words, the tufts attached to the head by means of a hot tufting process are not doubled over a middle portion along their length and are not mounted in the head by using an anchor/staple. The tufts are mounted on the head by means of an anchor-free tufting process.</p>
<p id="p-0061" num="0060">Alternatively, the head for the oral-care implement may be provided with a bristle carrier having at least one tuft hole, e.g. a blind-end bore. A tuft comprising a plurality of filaments may be fixed/anchored in said tuft hole by a stapling process/anchor tufting method. This means, that the filaments of the tuft are bent/folded around an anchor, e.g. an anchor wire or anchor plate, for example made of metal, in a substantially U-shaped manner. The filaments together with the anchor are pushed into the tuft hole so that the anchor penetrates into opposing side walls of the tuft hole thereby anchoring/fixing/fastening the filaments to the bristle carrier. The anchor may be fixed in opposing side walls by positive and frictional engagement.</p>
<p id="p-0062" num="0061">In case the tuft hole is a blind-end bore, the anchor holds the filaments against a bottom of the bore. In other words, the anchor may lie over the U-shaped bend in a substantially perpendicular manner. Since the filaments of the tuft are bent around the anchor in a substantially U-shaped configuration, a first limb and a second limb of each filament extend from the bristle carrier in a filament direction. Filament types which can be used/are suitable for usage in a stapling process are also called &#x201c;two-sided filaments&#x201d;. Heads for oral-care implements which are manufactured by a stapling process can be provided in a relatively low-cost and time-efficient manner.</p>
<p id="p-0063" num="0062">The following is a non-limiting discussion of an example embodiment of a personal/oral-care implement and parts thereof in accordance with the present disclosure, where reference to the Figures is made.</p>
<p id="p-0064" num="0063"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref> shows a personal-care implement <b>10</b>, in this specific embodiment an electrically operated oral-care implement, i.e. toothbrush <b>10</b>. Toothbrush <b>10</b> comprises an electrically operated assembly <b>12</b>, in this case a toothbrush handle <b>12</b> and a head <b>14</b>, the head <b>14</b> being repeatedly attachable to and detachable from the handle <b>12</b> by means of connector <b>16</b>. The connector <b>16</b> may comprise a spring-loaded snap element <b>116</b>, e.g. a spring-loaded ball element <b>116</b> comprising a ball <b>1116</b> and a spring <b>1126</b>, the spring <b>1126</b> applying a radial force onto the ball <b>1116</b> in a direction towards an outer lateral surface <b>120</b> of the connector <b>116</b>. The ball <b>1116</b> may be insertable into a recess provided in a hollow portion of the head <b>14</b> to securely fix the head <b>14</b> onto the connector <b>16</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0065" num="0064">The electrically operated assembly <b>12</b>/toothbrush handle <b>12</b> comprises a handle housing <b>20</b> defining an inner cavity <b>18</b>. The housing <b>20</b> has a proximal end <b>22</b> closest to the head <b>14</b> attachable to the handle <b>12</b>, and a distal end <b>24</b>. The distal end <b>24</b> is opposite the proximal end <b>22</b>. The connector <b>16</b> may extend through an opening <b>30</b> provided at the proximal end <b>22</b> of the handle housing <b>20</b>. In other words, the connector <b>16</b> may be partially accommodated within the inner cavity <b>18</b> at the proximal end <b>22</b> of the handle housing <b>20</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0066" num="0065">The connector <b>16</b> comprises a recess <b>17</b>. Recess <b>17</b> may be provided at the opposite side <b>11</b> of the connector <b>16</b> to which the head <b>14</b> is attachable. In the connector recess <b>17</b>, a motor <b>34</b> along with an eccentric weight <b>35</b> for operating the personal-care implement <b>10</b> is accommodated/mounted by means of press-fitting. In other words, the motor <b>34</b> and the eccentric weight <b>35</b> is mounted within the recess <b>17</b> of the connector <b>16</b>. The part of the connector <b>16</b> comprising the recess <b>17</b> housing the motor <b>34</b> and eccentric weight <b>35</b> may be mounted within the inner cavity <b>18</b> of the handle housing <b>20</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0067" num="0066">As derivable from <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b></figref>, the connector <b>16</b> has an overall length extension Lc extending along a longitudinal connector axis Xc, the overall length extension Lc being composed of a sub-length Li extending and being located within the inner cavity <b>18</b> of the handle housing <b>20</b>, and a sub-length Lo extending outside of the handle housing <b>20</b>. A ratio Rc of the length Li extending within the inner cavity <b>18</b> to the length Lo extending outside of the housing <b>20</b> may be from about 1 to about 1.7, or from about 1 to about 1.5. The overall length extension Lc of the connector <b>16</b> may be from about 35 mm to about 45 mm, or from about 39 mm to about 43 mm. The sub-length Li of the connector <b>16</b> extending within the inner cavity <b>18</b> of the handle housing <b>20</b> may be from about 20 mm to about 25 mm, or from about 22 mm to about 24 mm, while the sub-length Lo of the connector <b>16</b> extending outside of the handle housing <b>20</b> may be from about 15 mm to about 20 mm, or from about 17 mm to about 19 mm.</p>
<p id="p-0068" num="0067">A ratio Rhc of an overall length extension Lh of the handle housing <b>20</b> extending along a longitudinal housing axis Xh to the overall length extension Lc of the connector <b>16</b> extending along a longitudinal connector axis Xc may be from about 2.5 to about 4.5, or from about 3.0 to about 3.5. The overall length extension of the handle housing <b>20</b> and the overall length extension of the connector <b>16</b> is measured at the maximum extension of the housing <b>20</b> and connector <b>16</b>, respectively. The overall length extension Lh of the housing <b>20</b> extending along the longitudinal housing axis may be from about 120 mm to about 150 mm, or from about 125 mm to about 145 mm, or from about 130 mm to about 140 mm, or from about 130 mm to about 135 mm.</p>
<p id="p-0069" num="0068">The connector <b>16</b> is at least partially made from a material having an e-modulus being higher than the e-modulus of the material from which the handle housing <b>20</b> is made. For example, the material from which the connector is at least partially made may have an e-modulus of at least 4000 MPa, for example from about 4000 MPa to about 20000 MPa, or form about 10000 MPa to about 11000 MPa, or about 10400 MPa. A connector having such modulus of elasticity can be provided if the connector is at least partially molded from a hard plastic material, e.g. from a fiber-reinforced material, in particular a glass fiber-reinforced material.</p>
<p id="p-0070" num="0069">Due to its high stiffness, glass fiber-reinforced material is suitable for mounting the motor <b>34</b> with the eccentric weight <b>35</b> within the recess <b>17</b> of the connector <b>16</b> by means of press-fitting. Glass fiber-reinforced material shows no to very limited relaxation over time, resulting in effective vibration transmissions over the full usual life-time of the handle/implement. The glass fiber-reinforced material may comprise a polymer base material in which about 10 wt % to about 50 wt %, or from about 25 wt % to about 35 wt %, or about 30 wt % glass fibers are embedded. The polymer base material may be a polyamide or polybutylene terephthalate, polyethylene terephthalate, or a combination of polybutylene terephthalate and polyethylene terephthalate.</p>
<p id="p-0071" num="0070">A fiber-reinforced material comprising from about 25 wt % to about 35 wt % glass fiber, wherein the glass fibers are embedded in either polyamide as a base material, or, alternatively in a base material comprising a mixture of polybutylene terephthalate and polyethylene terephthalate may have an e-modulus of about 10400 MPa. Such glass fiber-reinforced material shows superior molding properties while providing sufficient stiffness to the connector <b>16</b>, as well as resistance against abrasion and wear out.</p>
<p id="p-0072" num="0071">While the connector <b>16</b> may be made from a fiber-reinforced material, e.g. glass fiber-reinforced material, the handle can be made from a standard hard plastic material, e.g. acrylonitrile styrene acrylate (ASA). If ASA is used as a material/base material for the handle housing <b>20</b>, a material with an e-modulus of about 2500 MPa may be provided. The hard plastic material (e.g. ASA) may be at least partially over-molded by a thermoplastic elastomer (TPE) providing the handle <b>12</b> with improved aesthetic and/or gripping properties.</p>
<p id="p-0073" num="0072">Also, the handle housing <b>20</b> may be made from at least two separate handle parts <b>52</b>, <b>54</b>, the separate parts <b>52</b>, <b>54</b> being connected via a screw thread, for example. While the first part <b>52</b> of the housing <b>20</b> may be molded from a hard plastic material, the second part <b>54</b> may be made from the same or another material to provide the handle/housing with superior aesthetic and/or gripping effects. For example, the second part <b>54</b> may be also made from a hard plastic material, but over-molded with TPE to provide superior gripping properties during use of the personal-care implement <b>10</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0074" num="0073">Between the first part <b>52</b> of the handle housing <b>20</b> and the second part <b>54</b> of the handle housing <b>20</b>, a first O-ring <b>56</b> may be inserted to provide the handle of the personal-care implement with additional aesthetic features and/or an indication element. Also, the first O-ring <b>56</b> may act as a sealing element to prevent any liquids, e.g. water or saliva, from entering the inner cavity <b>18</b> of the housing <b>20</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0075" num="0074">Further, on the connector <b>16</b>, a second O-ring <b>58</b> may be provided at the proximal end <b>22</b> of the handle housing <b>20</b>. The second O-ring <b>58</b> may serve as an aesthetic feature, an indication element and/or as a sealing element to prevent any liquids, like water and slurry, entering the inner cavity <b>18</b> of the handle housing <b>20</b>. The first and/or the second O-ring <b>56</b>, <b>58</b> may be made from an elastomeric material, for example.</p>
<p id="p-0076" num="0075">An energy source <b>38</b>, e.g. a battery <b>38</b>, for operating the personal-care implement <b>10</b> may be accommodated within the inner cavity <b>18</b> of the handle housing <b>20</b>. As derivable from <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>2</b> and <b>3</b></figref>, a switch assembly <b>40</b> connected to a Printed Circuit Board Assembly (PCBA) <b>42</b> provided within the inner cavity of the handle housing <b>20</b> can activate the energy source <b>38</b> and may switch the electrically operated personal-care implement <b>10</b> to an ON/OFF status. Via the PCBA <b>42</b> electrical communication between the battery <b>38</b>, as an example for an energy source, and the motor <b>34</b> can be provided.</p>
<p id="p-0077" num="0076">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>2</b> and <b>3</b></figref>, a chassis <b>48</b> may be inserted into the handle housing <b>20</b>, the chassis <b>48</b> fixing and holding the energy source <b>38</b> via spring <b>50</b>, the PCBA <b>42</b> and the connector <b>16</b> accommodating the motor <b>34</b> with the eccentric weight <b>35</b> in place.</p>
