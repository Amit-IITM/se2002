<heading level="1" id="h-0002">TECHNICAL FIELD</heading>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">The invention relates to the field of rubber tapping machines, in particular to a fully automatic intelligent tapping robot.</p>
<heading level="1" id="h-0003">BACKGROUND</heading>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">Natural rubber is a raw material of many rubber products. With the continuous development of science and technology, natural rubber products are more and more widely used in many aspects due to their excellent resilience, insulation, water resistance and plasticity, and become an important industrial resource. The demand of natural rubber is huge. Natural rubber flow from the laticifer in the bark of rubber trees, so as to obtain effective collection of natural rubber, this process is called rubber cutting.</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">Because of its high technical requirements, rubber tapping requires precise cutting of the rubber tree. It should not be too deep or too shallow. Mistakes in operation will lead to a reduction in rubber production. Therefore, most of the rubber tapping work has been carried out by experienced workers. However, the efficiency of manual operation by a single person is extremely slow. Often a rubber forest needs to invest a large number of rubber tapping workers, resulting in high labor costs. With fewer and fewer experienced workers, the gap between the demand and supply of rubber cutters in the rubber industry is widening. The best time to tap rubber is around three o&#x2032;clock in the morning. Manual tapping is also a great burden on the human body, so there is an urgent need for a method that can replace manual tapping.</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">In recent years, with the advancement of science and technology, many agriculture is developing in the direction of automation and intelligence. It is becoming more and more common for agricultural robots to replace human labor, but the rubber tapping work has not changed much. Some hand-held rubber tapping knives and operational rubber tapping machines have appeared, but they have not solved the problem of excessive labor costs in rubber tapping. Developing a fully automatic intelligent tapping robot system can effectively solve this problem.</p>
<heading level="1" id="h-0004">SUMMARY</heading>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">The fundamental problem to be solved by the present invention is to provide an intelligent robot system for fully automatic rubber tapping in the rubber forest. The specific issues can be divided into the following points:
<ul id="ul0001" list-style="none">
<li id="ul0001-0001" num="0007">(1) The movement of the tapping robot in the forest, including the stability of the overall robot movement and the accuracy of reaching the work site.</li>
<li id="ul0001-0002" num="0008">(2) After arriving at the work site, the rubber tapping knife can be accurately placed at the position where the rubber needs to be tapped.</li>
<li id="ul0001-0003" num="0009">(3) There will be reaction force and vibration during the rubber tapping process, which need to be overcome.</li>
<li id="ul0001-0004" num="0010">(4) The thickness and height of each tree of the rubber tree are different, requiring the robot to have a certain adaptive ability.</li>
<li id="ul0001-0005" num="0011">(5) The rubber tapping track is an inclined arc shape, and the final rubber tapping trace produced by the robot needs to satisfy.</li>
</ul>
</p>
<p id="p-0008" num="0012">In order to solve the problems of the technologies described above, the present invention adopts the following technical solutions:</p>
<p id="p-0009" num="0013">The overall solution of the present invention is, a fully automatic intelligent tapping robot, including a moving platform and a tapping robot arm; tapping robot arm is installed on the moving platform. The tapping robot arm is specially designed for rubber cutting operation, the end of the tapping robot arm is equipped with an end actuator, which is composed of a tree-hugging fixed device and a sliding rubber tapping device.</p>
<p id="p-0010" num="0014">Moving platform adopts a crawler-type movement method, which can adapt to the complex ground environment of the rubber forest. The front and rear wheels are used to drive the body movement at the same time to ensure a stable driving force on uneven ground, and there are shock-absorbing wheels to make the crawler fit the ground as much as possible. In order to improve the running stability, several shock absorbers are installed at the same time. On the one hand, shock absorbers can reduce the bumps and vibrations generated during the operation of the rubber tapping robot, and on the other hand, they can reduce the working vibration transmitted to the body during the tapping process. The purpose of above is to provide a stable working platform for entire robot system.</p>
<p id="p-0011" num="0015">Moving platform is equipped with a GPS positioning and navigation system, which can select accurate positioning, complete the autonomous navigation function according to the location information of the rubber tree to be tapped and the surrounding environment information, and help the robot to accurately arrive at the working place. In addition, the body is equipped with a rubber tapping robot arm specially designed for rubber tapping, and other related tools can also be mounted.</p>
<p id="p-0012" num="0016">Among them, the rubber tapping robot arm adopts a four-degree-of-freedom structure to meet the working space requirements of the rubber tapping operation. The rubber tapping robot arm is installed on the electric rotary table on the moving platform, and the overall structure of the rubber tapping robot arm is composed of a vertical and a horizontal sliding module.</p>
<p id="p-0013" num="0017">The rubber tapping robot arm contains four degrees of freedom, including: an overall rotational degree of freedom, adjusting the orientation of the rubber tapping robot arm according to the positional relationship between the rubber tapping location and the rubber tree incision position, so that the rubber tapping robot arm can face the rubber tree incision; vertical telescopic degree of freedom, adjust the height of the rubber tapping robot arm according to the height of the rubber tree incision, so that the rubber tapping robot arm can meet different height requirements; a horizontal telescopic degree of freedom, adjust the length according to the distance relationship between the rubber tapping robot arm and the rubber tree incision position, so that the end actuator is just at the incision position; one degree of freedom of end rotation adjusts the posture of the end actuator according to the different growth directions of the rubber tree and the state of the trunk, so that the end actuator can fix the trunk and align the incision position. Moreover, a shock absorber is installed at the joint of the rubber tapping robot arm, which can effectively reduce the vibration generated during the rubber tapping operation, and provide effective safety protection for the robot arm and the robot as a whole.</p>
<p id="p-0014" num="0018">Because the reaction force is relatively large during the rubber tapping operation, in order to ensure the smooth progress of the rubber tapping operation, the present invention specially designs a tree-hugging fixing mechanism for fixing. The tree-hugging fixing device is installed at the end of the rubber tapping robot arm as an end effector. The overall design of the tree-hugging fixing mechanism adopts two identical circular arc fixing parts with a gap. The gap is larger than the diameter of the rubber tree, which allowing the trunk to enter the arc. A guide wheel is installed at the gap, because errors may occur when working in the field, the guide wheel can help to let the tree trunk enter the arc and fixed better, and can prevent mechanical damage caused by large errors. Four fixing modules are installed on an arc fixing part, and the fixing modules can expand and contract along the diameter direction of the arc fixing part until they touch the tree trunk and stop stretching after realizing the fixing effect, thereby achieving a stable fixing effect. In order to ensure the rubber tapping effect, the center of the tree trunk and the center of the arc fixing part need to coincide as much as possible, so the four fixing modules on the same arc fixing part are connected by a timing belt, so that the expansion and contraction length of each fixing module is the same. There is an arc-shaped guide rail inside the arc-shaped fixing part, and the inside of the guide rail is a gear ring, which is used to install the sliding tapping device and provides it with an arc-shaped path.</p>
<p id="p-0015" num="0019">Among them, the upper and lower gears of the sliding rubber tapping device mesh with the internal ring gears of the upper and lower circular arc fixing parts respectively, and the gears can be driven by the motor to make the sliding rubber device move in a horizontal arc along the arc-shaped guide rail inside the arc fixing part, and the rubber tapping head on the sliding rubber tapping device is driven by a motor to move up and down. The above two different motion forms move simultaneously in an inclined arc-shaped trajectory in space, which is consistent with the rubber tapping cut marks, so the rubber tapping operation can be carried out. However, the slope of different tapping marks is different, and it is necessary to ensure that the direction of the tapping head is the same as that of the tapping marks, so the direction of the tapping head can be adjusted.</p>
<p id="p-0016" num="0020">When the present invention works, concrete process is as follows:
<ul id="ul0002" list-style="none">
<li id="ul0002-0001" num="0021">1. Autonomous navigation: obtain the location information of the moving platform according to the positioning system, identify the rubber tree through the image processing system and obtain its location information, and according to the position relationship between the two, the moving platform autonomously moves to a suitable working place.</li>
<li id="ul0002-0002" num="0022">2. Robotic arm control: first adjust the height of the forearm according to the height of the incision, then adjust the overall orientation of the robotic arm according to the direction of the rubber tree, then adjust the horizontal distance according to the distance from the rubber tree, and finally adjust the posture of the execution end according to the trunk posture to ensure that the cypress tree fixture can hold the trunk to fix.</li>
<li id="ul0002-0003" num="0023">3. Preparation for cutting: place the tapping knife at the starting point of tapping. Determine the slope of the tapping trace and adjust the direction of the tapping head.</li>
<li id="ul0002-0004" num="0024">4. Cutting the bark: after the above work is completed, the rubber tapping is started, and the sliding rubber tapping device is driven to move simultaneously along the circular arc fixing track and the up and down track to realize the rubber tapping.</li>
<li id="ul0002-0005" num="0025">5. After the above steps are completed, open the fixing mechanism and repeat the above steps.</li>
</ul>
</p>
<p id="p-0017" num="0026">Compared with the existing alternative artificial tapping technology, the present invention can achieve the following beneficial effects:</p>
<p id="p-0018" num="0027">Compared with manual hand-held rubber tapping machines, the present invention can independently perform rubber tapping operations without manual intervention, greatly reduces manual input, and significantly improves the working efficiency of rubber tapping and the efficiency of time-to-economy conversion; compared with the traditional rubber tapping machine, the tree-hugging installation type rubber tapping machine installs one machine per tree, and the overall investment is too high. The invention is a moving system that can work alone in a whole piece of rubber forest. The working area is large, which reduces the average input cost of each tree. Moreover, the end actuator of the present invention meets the technical requirements of traditional rubber tapping technology such as the cutting depth of the rubber tree, the rubber tapping consumption, and the smoothness of the cutting edge. In summary, the present invention has good promotion and use value.</p>

<p id="p-0031" num="0040">The present invention is a fully automatic rubber tapping robot system includes a crawler-type mobile platform <b>1</b>, which is a moving platform with a crawler structure and has a certain shock-absorbing ability, and is mainly responsible for carrying related equipment and moving between rubber forests, provides a stable platform for rubber tapping work, etc. the tapping robot arm <b>2</b> is connected with the electric rotary table <b>16</b> located on the crawler moving platform <b>1</b> through the connecting plate <b>18</b>, and its structure is a four-degree-of-freedom mechanical arm with vertical rotation and expansion and horizontal rotation. The tapping robot arm <b>2</b> has four degrees of freedom of expansion and contraction, it can meet the working space requirements of rubber tapping operations. The tree-hugging fixed device <b>3</b> is installed at the end of the tapping robot arm through the connector <b>26</b>, and its function is to fix the rubber tree inside the tree-hugging fixed device to ensure that the vibration during the rubber tapping operation is minimized, providing a stable working environment for the rubber tapping, and improving accuracy; the overall structure of sliding rubber tapping device <b>4</b> is a device with a rubber tapping cutter head formed by a plurality of motors. It mainly completes the rubber tapping operation after completing the preparatory work to ensure that the rubber tapping traces meet the process requirements. By the gear <b>43</b> on the sixth stepper motor <b>42</b> meshing with the wheel belt <b>39</b> on the tree-hugging fixture, it can be installed on the tree-hugging fixture and can move according to the gear belt <b>39</b> tracks.</p>
<p id="p-0032" num="0041">The above descriptions are the main functions and implementation methods of the devices. The details of the present invention will be further described below in conjunction with the drawings and implementation methods of each part. Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref>, the crawler-type moving platform <b>1</b> is a mobile platform with a crawler-type movement mode, the drive mode is four-wheel drive, and has a certain shock absorption capacity, so that the tapping robot can adapt to different rugged road conditions.</p>
<p id="p-0033" num="0042">The specific working details and mechanical structure are as follows: the front drive wheel <b>7</b> and the rear drive wheel <b>6</b> jointly drive the crawler belt <b>5</b> to rotate, thereby driving the body <b>12</b> to move. The front and rear wheel drive can effectively ensure that the rubber tapping robot has sufficient driving power in the forest to ensure the overall stable operation. The first guide wheel <b>8</b> and the second guide wheel <b>9</b> rotate under the drive of the crawler belt <b>5</b> to ensure that the overall crawler belt <b>5</b> rotates smoothly, and also ensure that the crawler belt <b>5</b> is tensioned to make the rotation process of the crawler belt <b>5</b> more stable; the first shock absorber <b>13</b> is housed on the top, and the third shock absorber <b>15</b> is housed on the rotating shaft of front driving wheel <b>7</b>, which can effectively reduce the vibration that produces because of driving; body <b>12</b> is also equipped with first damping wheel group <b>10</b> and the second damping wheel group <b>11</b>. The second shock absorber <b>14</b> is installed between the first damping wheel group <b>10</b> and the second damping wheel group <b>11</b>. The first damping wheel group <b>10</b> and the second damping wheel group <b>12</b> together with the second shock absorber <b>14</b> constitute a shock absorber structure with good shock absorbing performance, which can make the track <b>5</b> closely fit the ground and reduce the vibration caused by road bumps at the same time. The purpose of above is to ensure the stable operation of the tapping robot in the forest. The three shock absorbers can also reduce the vibration generated during the rubber tapping process to a certain extent during the rubber tapping operation. Body <b>12</b> is equipped with a GPS positioning system to perform general calibration of trees and self-position calibration. Meanwhile, the internal controller controls the crawler moving platform <b>1</b> according to the position information of the two, so that the robot can reach the designated working position.</p>
<p id="p-0034" num="0043">Further, an electric rotary table <b>16</b> is installed on body <b>12</b>, and the electric rotary table <b>16</b> is connected with the rubber tapping robot arm <b>2</b>, so that the rubber tapping robot arm <b>2</b> has an overall degree of freedom of rotation.</p>
<p id="p-0035" num="0044">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref>, after the rubber tapping robot reaches the target tree, it collects accurate information about the cut marks of the trees, such as the degree of inclination of the tree, the starting position of the cut marks, the end of the cut marks, the inclination of the cut marks, etc., and adjusts the rubber tapping robot arm <b>2</b> according to the above information. The rubber tapping robot arm and the electric rotary table <b>16</b> are connected through the connecting plate <b>18</b> to the electric rotary table <b>16</b> located on the crawler moving platform <b>1</b> through the connecting plate <b>10</b>, so that it is installed on the crawler moving platform. The overall structure of the rubber tapping robot arm is a four-degree-of-freedom robot arm. The four degrees of freedom are vertical lifting degree of freedom, vertical rotation degree of freedom, horizontal front-back degree of freedom, and horizontal rotation degree of freedom, which can meet the working space requirements of tapping work.</p>
<p id="p-0036" num="0045">The specific working details and mechanical structure are as follows: the rubber tapping robot arm <b>2</b> specifically works to adjust its own degrees of freedom so that the end actuator can reach the designated position. The rubber tapping robot arm <b>2</b> is fixed on the electric rotary table <b>16</b> through the connecting plate <b>18</b>, and the rotation of the electric rotary table <b>16</b> can drive the rubber tapping robot arm <b>2</b> to rotate as a whole, so that the mechanical arm has an overall rotation degree of freedom, and the rubber tapping robot arm <b>2</b> can be adjusted to face the rubber tapping location. Further, the electric rotary table <b>16</b> is connected with the vertical sliding module <b>18</b> through the first stepping motor <b>17</b>, and the rotation of the stepping motor <b>17</b> drives the screw mandrel in the vertical sliding module <b>18</b> to rotate, so that it is installed on the vertical sliding module <b>18</b>. The sliding connection <b>20</b> on the top can move in the vertical direction, so that the rubber tapping robot arm <b>2</b> has a degree of freedom of vertical lifting, and can adjust the end actuator to be at the same height as the tapping position; the second stepper motor <b>21</b> is installed on the sliding connection <b>20</b>, the end of the motor is connected to the horizontal sliding module <b>22</b>, so that the horizontal sliding module <b>22</b> can perform horizontal telescopic movement, so that the rubber tapping robot arm <b>2</b> has a horizontal telescopic degree of freedom, and can adjust the distance between the end actuator and the rubber tapping position; the third stepping motor <b>24</b> is installed at the end of the module <b>22</b>, and the tree-hugging fixed device <b>3</b> is installed at the end of the third stepping motor <b>24</b>. The third stepping motor <b>24</b> can drive the tree-hugging fixed device <b>3</b> to rotate, that is, there is a horizontal rotation at the end. The degree of freedom can make the tree-hugging fixed device <b>3</b> adapt to rubber tree trunks in different growth directions. The fourth shock absorber <b>23</b> is installed at the connection between the stepper motor <b>17</b> and the vertical slide module <b>18</b>, and the fifth shock absorber <b>25</b> is installed at the connection between the horizontal slide module <b>22</b> and the third stepper motor <b>24</b>. The four shock absorbers <b>23</b> and the fifth shock absorber <b>25</b> can effectively reduce the impact of the vibration generated in the rubber tapping process on the mechanical arm and the overall robot. Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b></figref>, the tree-hugging fixed device <b>3</b> is connected to the end of the third stepping motor <b>24</b> in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref> through a connector <b>26</b>, that is, the tree-hugging fixed device serves as an end actuator. The whole tree-hugging mechanism is a cylinder mechanism composed of two arc fixing parts <b>27</b> up and down. Its function is to stably fix the rubber tree trunk inside the tree-hugging fixed device, provide a stable working environment, and reduce the vibration caused by rubber tapping.</p>
<p id="p-0037" num="0046">The tree-hugging fixed device has symmetrical mechanism up and down, and the working steps are same. Therefore, the above half parts are illustrated as examples to illustrate its main functions and implementation methods. The tree-hugging fixed device <b>3</b> and its main body are fixed by two identical upper and lower arcs with arc fixing piece <b>27</b>, the gap of the circular arc fixing part <b>27</b> is larger than the diameter of the rubber tree, so that all rubber trees can be fixed. Taking the upper half of the arc fixing part <b>27</b> as an example. A guide wheel <b>38</b> is installed at the gap of the arc fixing part <b>27</b>. Because there will be a certain error in information collection and overweight control of the mechanical arm, the guide wheel <b>38</b> can be used in the presence of a certain error. Under the circumstances, let the trunk enter the inside of the arc fixing part <b>27</b>, thereby preventing mechanical damage caused by large errors, and can also effectively protect the tree surface and ensure the rubber tapping effect. After the trunk enters the tree-hugging fixed device <b>3</b>, the four fixing modules (<b>28</b>, <b>29</b>, <b>30</b>, <b>31</b>) that are evenly distributed on the arc fixing part <b>27</b> move inwardly at the same time until they touch the trunk and stop stretching after realizing the fixing effect, thereby achieve a stable fixation effect. Taking the third fixing module <b>30</b> as an example, the specific mechanisms and functions of the fixing module <b>30</b> are respectively: a pressing block <b>301</b>, which directly contacts the tree trunk for its fixing and pressing effect, and it is connected with a screw mandrel <b>304</b> through a ball head <b>302</b>, so that the compacting block <b>301</b> has a spherical degree of freedom within a certain range, adapting to the different surfaces of the trunk of the rubber tree. The screw mandrel <b>304</b> makes the pressing block <b>301</b> telescopically movable. Two synchronous belts <b>36</b> are connected with other pulleys, thereby guaranteeing that all fixed modules have the same degree of expansion and contraction. The specific workflow of all four fixed modules is as follows: the first pulley <b>32</b> is driven by a motor, and is connected with the screw pulley on the first fixed module <b>28</b> and the second fixed module <b>29</b> respectively by the first synchronous belt <b>35</b>; the screw pulley on the first fixed module <b>28</b> is connected with the lead screw pulley on the fourth fixed module <b>31</b> by bypassing the third belt <b>34</b> through the third synchronous belt <b>37</b>; the screw pulley on the second fixed module <b>29</b> is connected with the screw pulley on the third fixed module <b>30</b> by bypassing the second pulley <b>33</b> through the second synchronous belt <b>36</b>. That is to say, it can be ensured that the rotation speeds of the screw pulleys on each fixed module are the same, so that the expansion and contraction lengths of each fixed module are the same at the same time.</p>
<p id="p-0038" num="0047">The fundamental purpose of the above steps is to make the center of the trunk coincide with the center of the arc fixture <b>27</b>, and only when the two centers coincide can achieve the best rubber tapping effect, that is, to ensure that the depth of the tapping traces on the trunk surface is the same. Further, there is an arc-shaped guide rail inside the arc-arc fixing part <b>27</b>, and an internal ring gears <b>39</b> is arranged on the guide rail. It is used to install the sliding rubber tapping device <b>4</b> and make it capable of arc operation.</p>
<p id="p-0039" num="0048">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b></figref>, the sliding rubber tapping device <b>4</b> is composed of multiple motors, and the cooperative operation of multiple motors can actually conform to the movement trajectory of the rubber tapping operation, and the sliding rubber tapping device is equipped with a rubber tapping head to achieve the rubber tapping effect.</p>
<p id="p-0040" num="0049">The specific work details and mechanical structure are as follows: the sliding rubber tapping device is installed on the tree-hugging fixed device through the gear <b>43</b> meshing with the internal ring gears <b>39</b>, the stepping motor <b>42</b> drives gear <b>43</b> to rotate, and gear <b>43</b> meses with internal ring gears <b>39</b> to form a drive, which can make the sliding rubber tapping device <b>4</b> as a whole move in an arc along the track of internal ring gears <b>39</b>, and the stepper motor <b>41</b> can make the stepper motor <b>40</b> move up and down in vertical direction by driving the lead screw <b>46</b>. Tapping knife <b>45</b> is installed on the end of stepping motor <b>40</b>, which makes the tapping knife <b>45</b> move in a circular arc and move vertically up and down at the same time. Because the arc-shaped motion track and the up-and-down direction motion track are carried out at the same time, due to the superposition of the motion direction, the tapping knife <b>45</b> can move along an inclined arc-shaped track in space, and the inclined arc-shaped track coincides with the rubber-tapping trace, that is, the motion profiles can be used for rubber tapping operations. Further, the stepper motor <b>40</b> can drive the tapping knife <b>45</b> to rotate, so that the cutting edge of the tapping knife <b>45</b> can be adjusted, the direction of cutting edge is the same as the advancing direction of the tapping knife <b>45</b>, thereby successfully completing the rubber tapping work. The rubber tapping marks in the same rubber forest are basically compatible, so in order to ensure the accuracy, the stepper motor <b>40</b> can only adjust the direction of the knife edge in a small range. The handle <b>44</b> can be adjusted manually.</p>
