<p id="p-0002" num="0001">The present invention relates to a prolonged release formulation of caffeine, which comprises of caffeine embedded in continuous phase of non-polymeric release controlling carrier. The continuous phase may be comprised of about 20 to 70% by weight of caffeine and about 20 to 80% by weight of non-polymeric release controlling carrier. The formulation may be optionally comprised of one or more excipients, which are acceptable in nutraceutical and food industry. The invention also relates to a process for preparation; wherein caffeine is uniformly distributed throughout the continuous phase of non-polymeric release controlling carrier to get single-phase granules. The formulation releases caffeine through continuous phase of non-polymeric release controlling carrier, wherein about 25 to 60% of caffeine is released in first hour, about 50 to 90% of release in 4-8 hours and about 70 to 100% of caffeine release in 8-12 hours. Caffeine formulation comprising single-phase granules can advantageously be administered to a subject for achieving stimulant effect, improving the focus and conferring the alertness through prolonged release of caffeine over entire day.</p>
<heading id="h-0001" level="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">Caffeine is the most frequently consumed stimulant in the world which belongs to the class of xanthine or xanthine derivative. Approximately 80 percent of the adult population consumes between 200-250 mg of caffeine daily. Conveniently, caffeine is found in beverages such as coffee, tea and soda as well as certain foods such as chocolate and cocoa, so that an individual merely has to consume such foods or beverages in order to introduce caffeine into their system. One of the most common forms of administering caffeine is by consuming a cup of hot coffee early in the morning to help the individual to become more alert when beginning the day. Many consume three to four cups of coffee a day, to maintain caffeine levels in the body throughout the day. Moderate doses of caffeine can lead to an increase in physical task performance, making it very useful for combating fatigue. Caffeine is also believed to have other beneficial uses as well including improving body coordination, endurance, and mental performance.</p>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">Caffeine's effect is likely attributable to its function as a mild central nervous system stimulant, whereby it competitively binds to adenosine receptors, leading to a suppression of its inhibitory effect on CNS activity. Caffeine is used in many commercially available energy supplements, which is consumed by sports person as well as students. Such products typically induce only 90-120 minutes of increased alertness and consequently, repeat administration of such energy supplements is practiced. This is because caffeine is only active for a short period of time and then its half-life reduces its effectiveness.</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">Moreover, the frequent use of such products can have adverse effects on resting cardiovascular parameters, as well as on hepatic and renal function. Higher and frequent doses also cause other uncomfortable side effects such as anxiety, jitters, and result in the difficulty of relaxing and sleeping.</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">Prior art deals with developing sustained or slow release formulations of caffeine, in order to modulate release of caffeine to achieve its effect in desired hours of the day. Many of the formulations are designed in the form of combination of immediate release and extended release, to achieve initial loading dose for providing alertness, followed by extended release of the active over desired time period. The formulations are mostly in the form of core coated with hydrophilic or hydrophobic polymer; or in the form of microparticles in which active is layered on neutral core, followed by multiple layers of coatings to control release of the active. Such type of formulations requires specialized equipment and the migration and release of active becomes dependent on multiple factors such as core, coating layers, thus resulting into complexity in achieving in-vitro and in-vivo relationship for release of active. More precisely, there are chances of dose dumping or incomplete drug release from such dosage forms, thus ultimately affecting the efficacy of the formulation and failure in getting desired effect.</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">U.S. Pat. No. 8,268,352 relates to modified release dosage form comprising of micromatrix particles of a high solubility active ingredient prepared by using dual retard technique, which is a combination of matrix formulation and reservoir formulation. The dosage form consists of micro matrix particles which contain active ingredient and one or more hydrophobic release controlling agents. The particles are further coated by hydrophobic release controlling agents to form a double barrier to control the diffusion of the active.</p>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">U.S. Pat. No. 5,700,484 describes a sustained release composition in the form of microparticle comprising of three layers surrounding the core. The first layer surrounding the core comprises of a biodegradable matrix system comprising a water insoluble release retardant, stimulant and a water-soluble binding agent which binds the stimulant to the microparticle; the second layer surrounds the first layer and further delays the release; third layer is similar to the first layer comprising of water-soluble binding agent, a water insoluble release retarding agent and stimulant. The water-soluble polymers used herein are polyvinyl pyrrolidones or similar water-soluble organic polymers such as polyacrylate esters.</p>
<p id="p-0009" num="0008">US20160128943 relates to an oral formulation comprising a first component providing for immediate or rapid release of caffeine, and a second component providing for extended release of caffeine, wherein the formulation provides a blood plasma concentration of caffeine at least about 0.3 &#x3bc;g/mL and maintains the concentration for at least four hours. The extended release component of the formulation comprises one or more hydrophilic polymers.</p>
<p id="p-0010" num="0009">US20190192444 describes a composition comprising at least one microparticle, wherein said at least one microparticle is in the form of a core-shell, and wherein said core comprises at least one active agent; and at least one pH-triggered ingredient, at least one enteric ingredient, or at least one enzymatically-degradable ingredient, or any combination thereof; and said shell comprises one or more water-insoluble and enzymatically-degradable ingredients, wherein the weight ratio of said active agent and the sum of (b) ranges from 1:10 to 10:1.</p>
<p id="p-0011" num="0010">U.S. Pat. No. 8,449,920 relates to a method for producing sports beverage comprising: providing one or more sustained-release beads, each of the sustained-release beads comprising, 40 wt % to 95 wt % of one or more binding agents; and 5 wt % to 60 wt % of active ingredients consisting of caffeine, electrolytes, and vitamins; providing a dispersion medium comprising: an aqueous solution; and one or more thickening agents; and mixing the one or more sustained-release beads in the dispersion medium.</p>
<p id="p-0012" num="0011">There is a need to develop caffeine formulations, which would ensure reliable, reproducible, and consistent release pattern of the active for prolonged time of the day, with low variability. Such formulations should help the subject to achieve the desired level of alertness during initial hours in the day and prolonging the effect throughout the day, without interfering with normal sleep cycle.</p>
<p id="p-0013" num="0012">It was surprisingly found, that these requirements were met by formulations of the present invention, by employing non-coated, non-layered, single-phase granule composition, comprised of non-polymeric release controlling carrier in which caffeine is uniformly dispersed, using simple and economic process of melt granulation. These formulations are easy to prepare, using commonly available equipment. Optimal selection of type and concentration of non-polymeric release controlling carrier by the present inventors has resulted in continuous phase formulation of caffeine which ensures slow release of active over about 6-12 hours. It would thus be advantageous to provide caffeine in a prolonged release continuous phase formulation that does not require re-administration of the active, for maintaining the alertness throughout the day.</p>
<heading id="h-0002" level="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0014" num="0013">The present inventors have developed a prolonged release formulation of caffeine for oral administration, which is non-coated and non-layered. The formulation is comprised of caffeine embedded in continuous phase of at least one non-polymeric release controlling carrier. The composition may be comprised of about 20 to 70% by weight of caffeine and about 20 to 80% by weight of continuous phase comprised of at least one non-polymeric release controlling carrier and optionally about 0 to 60% by weight of one or more excipients, which are acceptable in nutraceutical and food industry.</p>

<heading id="h-0004" level="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION</heading>
<p id="p-0025" num="0024">The invention relates to a prolonged release formulation of caffeine, wherein the active is uniformly distributed in continuous phase of non-polymeric release controlling carrier. Caffeine formulation is non-coated, non-layered and single-phase composition, comprised of at least one non-polymeric release controlling carrier.</p>
<p id="p-0026" num="0025">The formulation may be free of any excipients or may be optionally comprised of one or more excipients, which are acceptable in nutraceutical and food industry. The invention also relates to a process for preparation, wherein caffeine is embedded uniformly in the continuous phase of non-polymeric carrier, by suitable process of granulation. Formulation releases caffeine over a prolonged period of 8 to 12 hours and it is useful for delivering the stimulant over day-long time, thus eliminating the need for repeated administration of the active.</p>
<p id="p-0027" num="0026">Caffeine as used in this invention is purchased in the form of white crystalline, odorless, bitter powder and having 98 to 101% of active content. Caffeine exhibits good water solubility. It is supplied from a manufacturer, who obtains it from natural source <i>Coffea Robusta</i>, belonging to Rubiaceae family.</p>
<p id="p-0028" num="0027">The terminology &#x2018;prolonged release&#x2019; as used herein refers to release pattern of the active from continuous phase of non-polymeric release controlling polymer, at desired rate over a period of 6 to 12 hours.

<p id="p-0067" num="0062">Process of Formula 1, as described in Example 1 was followed to prepare various caffeine formulations, covered in Table 4. The molten form was collected and processed to get granules in the range of 400 to 800 micron. The release profile was checked using dissolution apparatus, which is also included in Table 4.</p>
<p id="p-0068" num="0063">The dissolution profile of caffeine formulation indicates prolonged release pattern, wherein about 25-30% of caffeine is released within first hour and about 60 to 75% of caffeine is released in 4-6 hours, followed by about 80-100% release in 8-12 hours. The release pattern is achieved through use of continuous phase of non-polymeric release controlling carriers.</p>
