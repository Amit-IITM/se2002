<p id="p-0001" num="0000">A toilet seat mounting assembly that includes a hinge mount on an upper surface of a portion of a pedestal, the hinge mount having a body with a bore; an anchor underneath a lower surface of the portion; a fastener extending through the bore and operatively coupled to the anchor to clamp the portion between the hinge mount and the anchor; a hinge base having a mount supported by the upper surface, the mount having an outer wall, which defines an opening that receives the body, and a locking feature flexibly coupled to the outer wall; and a lock cap rotatably coupled to the mount and having a wall. The wall retains the locking feature into a locking engagement with the hinge mount in a locking position of the lock cap, and the mount is removable from the hinge mount in a non-locking position of the lock cap.</p>

<p id="p-0122" num="0121"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>5</b>-<b>8</b></figref> illustrate an embodiment of a hinge lock <b>303</b> for securing a hinge <b>123</b> to a toilet. The hinge lock <b>303</b> moves relative to the hinge <b>123</b> between a first (e.g., unlocking) position, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b></figref>, in which the hinge <b>123</b> is unsecured to a toilet (not shown), and a second (e.g., locking) position, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>7</b></figref>, in which the hinge <b>123</b> is secured to a toilet through the hinge lock <b>303</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0123" num="0122">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b></figref>, the hinge <b>123</b> includes a base <b>125</b> that is elongated laterally (i.e., side to side with respect to the toilet) and includes a bore <b>125</b><i>a </i>extending longitudinally through the base <b>125</b> in the lateral direction. The bore <b>125</b><i>a </i>receives one or more other elements/components (e.g., pivot, damper, another hinge element, etc.). Extending rearward away from the base <b>125</b> is a hinge mount <b>127</b> associated with each mounting location (e.g., a two mount hinge will include two hinge mounts either separately or integrally formed). Each hinge mount <b>127</b> is secured to the toilet (e.g., the upper surface <b>111</b> of the bowl <b>101</b>) through an associated hinge lock <b>303</b>. As shown, each hinge mount <b>127</b> includes a flange that extends from the base <b>125</b> and includes an opening <b>128</b> therein for receiving a hinge lock <b>303</b>. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>9</b></figref>, the opening <b>128</b> is generally keyway shaped having a substantially circular portion <b>128</b><i>a </i>overlapping with a substantially rectangular portion <b>128</b><i>b</i>. The keyway opening <b>128</b> facilitates securing the hinge <b>123</b> to a toilet with the hinge lock (e.g., the hinge lock <b>303</b>, <b>403</b>, <b>503</b>, etc.).</p>
<p id="p-0124" num="0123">The hinge lock <b>303</b> is shown to include a locking member <b>331</b> and a locating member <b>332</b>. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>6</b> and <b>8</b></figref>, the locking member <b>331</b> includes a threaded shaft <b>334</b> and a head <b>335</b> disposed on the end of the shaft <b>334</b>. The shaft <b>334</b> threads to a fastener (e.g., nut, etc.) to clamp the hinge <b>123</b> between the head <b>335</b> and a portion of a toilet (e.g., the bowl <b>101</b>). The head <b>335</b> is coupled to (e.g., over-molded onto) the shaft <b>334</b> (e.g., fixedly coupled, rotatably coupled), and the head <b>335</b> includes an annular base <b>336</b> and one or more than one flange <b>337</b> extending radially outward from the base <b>336</b> relative to a central axis CA (of the shaft <b>334</b>). For example, the head <b>335</b> may include two flanges <b>337</b> extending radially away from the base <b>336</b> on opposite sides of the base <b>336</b>. Each flange <b>337</b> retains (e.g., contacts) the hinge mount <b>127</b> in a locking position to secure the hinge mount <b>127</b> in place. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>6</b></figref>, a tab <b>338</b> extends upwardly from the base <b>336</b> and transversely to the flange <b>337</b> to facilitate rotation or grasping the locking member <b>331</b> during assembly/disassembly.</p>
<p id="p-0125" num="0124">The locating member <b>332</b> includes an annular base <b>339</b> and one or more flanges <b>340</b> extending radially outward from the base <b>339</b> relative to the central axis CA. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>6</b> and <b>8</b></figref>, two flanges <b>340</b> extend radially outward from opposite sides of the base <b>339</b>, and each flange <b>340</b> has a generally rectangular shape that complements the rectangular portion <b>128</b><i>b </i>of the opening <b>128</b> in the hinge mount <b>127</b>. It is noted that each flange may have another shape that complements a portion of an opening in the hinge mount.

The coupled locating member <b>332</b> and locking member <b>331</b> are then coupled to a hinge mount <b>127</b> of a hinge <b>123</b> by inserting the locating member into the opening <b>128</b> in the hinge mount <b>127</b> with the flanges <b>340</b> aligned with and engaging corresponding portions (e.g., rectangular portions <b>128</b><i>b</i>) of the opening <b>128</b>. The shaft <b>334</b> of the locking member <b>331</b> extends through the opening <b>128</b> and an opening in the toilet (to which the hinge <b>123</b> is being secured to), and a fastener (e.g., nut, etc.) is coupled to the shaft <b>334</b> to clamp the hinge <b>123</b> to the toilet through the head <b>335</b> and the fastener.</p>
<p id="p-0127" num="0126"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>9</b>-<b>13</b></figref> illustrate an embodiment of a hinge lock <b>403</b> for securing a hinge <b>123</b> to a toilet. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>9</b></figref>, the hinge lock <b>403</b> includes a locating member <b>432</b> and a threaded fastener <b>434</b>. The locating member <b>432</b> includes a base <b>436</b> and two flanges <b>437</b> extending radially outward from opposite sides of the base <b>436</b>. The fastener <b>434</b> extends through an opening in the base <b>436</b> with a head of the fastener <b>434</b> contacting the base <b>436</b> (e.g., disposed in a pocket of the base) to secure the locating member <b>432</b> to another element/component of the system (e.g., the toilet). Disposed on the base <b>436</b> is a locking feature <b>438</b> having a channel <b>439</b> (e.g., groove, etc.) extending into an outer periphery of the locking feature <b>438</b>. The channel <b>439</b> receives a locking member <b>431</b> and is spiral shaped (e.g., threaded) to facilitate rotation of the locking member <b>431</b> relative to the locking feature <b>438</b>, as discussed below. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>9</b> and <b>10</b></figref>, the locating member <b>432</b> is received in the opening <b>128</b> of the hinge mount <b>127</b> with the flanges <b>437</b> in the receiving portions (e.g., rectangular portions <b>128</b><i>b</i>) of the opening <b>128</b>, and the fastener <b>434</b> extends through the opening in the locating member <b>432</b> and the opening <b>128</b> in the hinge mount <b>127</b> in order to engage with (e.g., thread to) another fastener (e.g., a nut) on the other side of the portion (e.g., wall) of the toilet.</p>
<p id="p-0128" num="0127">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>11</b>-<b>13</b></figref>, the hinge lock <b>403</b> includes a locking member <b>431</b> to secure the hinge <b>123</b> in place on the toilet. As shown, the locking member <b>431</b> includes an annular shaped base <b>441</b> having one or more than one inwardly extending flange <b>442</b> for engaging the channel <b>439</b>. For example, the locking member <b>431</b> may include two flanges <b>442</b> disposed on different portions of the base <b>441</b> (e.g., opposite sides of the base). Each flange <b>442</b> extends radially inward from an inside of the base <b>441</b> to engage the channel <b>439</b> to couple the locking member <b>431</b> to the locating member <b>432</b>. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>11</b></figref>, the locking member <b>431</b> includes a generally rectangular top member <b>443</b> extending over the base <b>441</b>. The top member <b>443</b> makes it easy to turn the locking member <b>431</b> by grasping and rotating the top member <b>443</b>. Ends of the top member <b>443</b> extend beyond the outer diameter of the base <b>441</b> to overlap with the hinge mount <b>127</b> and secure the hinge mount <b>127</b> in place.</p>
<p id="p-0129" num="0128">During assembly of the seat to the toilet using the hinge lock <b>403</b>, the locating member <b>432</b> is inserted into the opening <b>128</b> of the hinge mount <b>127</b> with the flanges <b>437</b> of the locating member <b>432</b> received in the receiving portions <b>128</b><i>b </i>of the opening <b>128</b>, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>10</b></figref>, and with the fastener <b>434</b> extending through an opening in the toilet.

<p id="p-0151" num="0150">As shown best in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>44</b></figref>, the sleeve <b>1104</b> includes a tubular body <b>1140</b> and a flange <b>1141</b> extending outwardly from the body <b>1140</b> at one end thereof. A pair of spaced apart tabs <b>1142</b> extend outwardly from a section of the body <b>1140</b> to retain a portion of the wiring <b>1109</b> between the tabs <b>1142</b>. The flange <b>1141</b> rests on the toilet when assembled and has an opening <b>1143</b> that is in-line with the tabs <b>1142</b> allowing the wiring <b>1109</b> to be routed through the opening <b>1143</b> and into the notch <b>1154</b> of the locating member <b>1105</b>. The flange <b>1141</b> can be made from gasket material or another suitable material. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>45</b></figref>, the body <b>1140</b> of the sleeve <b>1104</b> can be smooth or as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>46</b> and <b>47</b></figref>, the body <b>1140</b> can include corrugations <b>1145</b> that are configured to crush when subjected to a threshold compression force and separate (e.g., extend) when subjected to a threshold tensile force. The smooth body <b>1140</b> can also crush at a threshold compression force, but the corrugations <b>1145</b> better control the location and force of the crushing.</p>
<p id="p-0152" num="0151">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>48</b></figref>, a toilet seat assembly <b>1202</b> is shown according to an exemplary embodiment. The toilet seat assembly <b>1202</b> includes a lid <b>1222</b> (e.g., cover, etc.) covering and concealing a seat <b>1221</b>, and a hinge <b>1223</b> for rotatably coupling the seat <b>1221</b> and the lid <b>1222</b> to a toilet base. The hinge <b>1223</b> includes a fixed body <b>1224</b> (shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>50</b></figref>). The fixed body <b>1224</b> may house electronics for operating the seat <b>1221</b> and/or the lid <b>1222</b>. For example, the fixed body <b>1224</b> may house a motor assembly for electrically raising and lowering the seat <b>1221</b> and/or the lid <b>1222</b>. According to other exemplary embodiments, the fixed body <b>1224</b> may house or electrically connect to other components, such as a light source configured to transmit light into the bowl <b>101</b> of a toilet <b>100</b> (e.g., illuminating the toilet <b>100</b> at night as a night light) or may power a device configured to release a scent in or proximate the toilet <b>100</b> to control or eliminate odor emanating from the toilet. The fixed body <b>1224</b> may contain cleaning solution or scent and may be configured to release the cleaning solution or scent into the bowl <b>101</b>. The fixed body <b>1224</b> may also include a sensor for determining the presence of a user and is configured to instruct the motor assembly to automatically raise the seat <b>1221</b> and/or the lid <b>1222</b> when it senses the presence of the user and to automatically lower the seat <b>1221</b> and/or the lid <b>1222</b> as well as flush the toilet when it senses the user depart.</p>
<p id="p-0153" num="0152">According to an exemplary embodiment, the toilet seat assembly <b>1202</b> is configured to be controlled remotely. The fixed body <b>1224</b> houses a receiver (not shown) which is configured to connect wirelessly (e.g., via Bluetooth. ZigBee, Wi-Fi, etc.) to a controller (not shown). The controller may be an electronic touch-screen or capacitive touch monitor for wireless operation of the toilet seat assembly <b>1202</b>. According to another exemplary embodiment, the toilet seat assembly <b>1202</b> may be operated by a mobile device (e.g., smartphone). For example, when the receiver senses the presence of a mobile device, the receiver determines that a person with a given user profile is approaching the toilet. The toilet seat assembly <b>1202</b> responds to the presence of the person either automatically or in response to a user input applied to the controller and transmitted to the receiver. For example, the toilet seat assembly <b>1202</b> may lift at least one of the seat <b>1221</b> or the lid <b>1222</b>, such that the toilet <b>100</b> is available for immediate use when the person reaches the toilet <b>100</b>. The toilet seat assembly <b>1202</b> may respond differently to actions by users based on pre-determined user profiles. For example, when a first user approaches the toilet <b>100</b> with a first user profile, the lid <b>1222</b> may lift to a raised position while the seat <b>1221</b> remains in a lowered position. However, when a second user approaches the toilet <b>100</b> with a second user profile, both the lid <b>1222</b> and the seat <b>1221</b> may lift to a raised position.</p>
<p id="p-0154" num="0153">Once a person is finished using the toilet <b>100</b> and leaves the immediate vicinity of the toilet <b>100</b>, the receiver receives a signal from the controller either automatically or in response to a user input applied to the controller. For example, the controller transmits a signal to the receiver to lower one or both of the seat <b>1221</b> and the lid <b>1222</b> to a lowered position. The receiver may further transmit a signal to the toilet seat assembly <b>1202</b> to instruct the toilet <b>100</b> to begin a flush sequence for evacuating the contents in the bowl <b>101</b>. The controller may further be used to operate other electronic devices, including the light source or releasing a scent or cleaning solution into the bowl <b>101</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0155" num="0154">Referring still to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>48</b></figref>, the toilet seat assembly <b>1202</b> includes a docking station <b>1230</b>. The docking station <b>1230</b> is configured to be electrically coupled to a power supply (not shown) and receive the hinge <b>1223</b> thereon, such that the docking station <b>1230</b> electrically connects the hinge <b>1223</b> to the power supply. The docking station <b>1230</b> includes a generally planar docking body <b>1232</b> defining a lower surface <b>1234</b> configured to be disposed on the upper surface <b>111</b> of a toilet bowl <b>101</b>, and an opposing upper surface <b>1236</b>. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>48</b></figref>, the toilet seat assembly <b>1202</b> includes hinge locks <b>1203</b> extending through the docking station <b>1230</b> for coupling the docking station <b>1230</b> to the bowl <b>101</b>. The hinge locks <b>1203</b> may be substantially the same as any of the hinge locks described above, such that the docking station <b>1230</b> may be quickly connected to (and disconnected from) the bowl <b>101</b> just as the toilet seat assemblies, descried above, are quickly connectable and disconnectable from the bowl <b>101</b>. For example, each hinge lock <b>1203</b> includes a sleeve <b>1204</b> engaging an opening in the toilet <b>100</b>, a locating member <b>1205</b> disposed on one end of the sleeve <b>1204</b> (e.g., in the upper surface <b>1236</b> of the docking body <b>1232</b>), a fastener <b>1207</b> engaging the locating member <b>1205</b> and the sleeve <b>1204</b>, and a nut (not shown) coupled to the other end of the sleeve <b>1204</b> and the fastener <b>1207</b> to secure the docking station <b>1230</b> to the toilet <b>100</b>. The sleeve <b>1204</b> may be compressed within an opening in the toilet to further prevent the docking station <b>1230</b> from sliding in a lateral direction against the toilet. The sleeve <b>1204</b> can be configured having a hollow cylindrical shape or having a generally frusto-conical shape tapering inward toward the vitreous (as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>48</b></figref>) so that the sleeve <b>1204</b> can be used with toilets having different sized holes and still remove tolerance to provide a secure fit.</p>
<p id="p-0156" num="0155">While <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>42</b>-<b>44</b></figref> show a hinge lock <b>1103</b> with electrical wiring <b>1109</b> passing through the hinge lock <b>1103</b> external to the sleeve <b>1104</b>, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>48</b></figref>, a portion of the hinge lock <b>1203</b> is hollow and configured to pass electrical wiring <b>1209</b> therethrough. Specifically. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>48</b></figref> shows a hollow fastener <b>1207</b>, defining a bore <b>1210</b> extending therethrough, such that at least a portion of the electrical wiring <b>1209</b> is configured to extend through the bore <b>1210</b> of the fastener <b>1207</b>, from the lower surface <b>1234</b> of the docking body <b>1232</b> to the upper surface <b>1236</b> of the docking body <b>1232</b>. In this configuration, the electrical wiring <b>1209</b> passes through the docking station <b>1230</b> without interfering with the connection between the sleeve <b>1204</b> and the corresponding openings in the bowl <b>101</b> receiving the sleeve <b>1204</b>. While <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>48</b></figref> shows each of the two hinge locks <b>1203</b> defining bores <b>1210</b> extending therethrough, it should be understood that only one of the hinge locks <b>1203</b> defines a bore <b>1210</b> and receives electrical wiring <b>1209</b> extending therethrough. Similarly, while the docking station <b>1230</b> shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>48</b></figref> may have a quick-connect configuration, it should be understood that the docking station <b>1230</b> may be more permanently coupled to the bowl <b>101</b>, while the hinge <b>1223</b> remains easily separable from the docking station <b>1230</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0157" num="0156">A plurality of locator projections (i.e., locating members) <b>1238</b> extend generally upward and away from the upper surface <b>1236</b> of the docking body <b>1232</b> and are configured to engage corresponding openings <b>1242</b> formed in the hinge <b>1223</b>. Each locator projection <b>1238</b> defines an end <b>1239</b> extending away from the docking body <b>1232</b> and a diameter at the end <b>1239</b> that is less than a diameter of a lower portion <b>1240</b> of the locator projection <b>1238</b>. The diameter at the end <b>1239</b> is less than a diameter of the opening <b>1242</b>, such that the locator projections <b>1238</b> may be easily received in the corresponding openings <b>1242</b> without precisely aligning the openings <b>1242</b> with the locator projections <b>1238</b>. The diameter of the lower portion <b>1240</b> of the locator projections is substantially the same as the diameter of the openings <b>1242</b>, such that as the hinge <b>1223</b> is lowered onto the docking station <b>1230</b>, the openings <b>1242</b> begin to tightly engage the lower portion <b>1240</b> of the locator projections <b>1238</b>. In this configuration, the interaction of the locator projections <b>1238</b> and the openings <b>1242</b> prevents lateral movement of the hinge <b>1223</b> relative to the docking station <b>1230</b> once the hinge <b>1223</b> is installed thereon. A gasket <b>1241</b> (i.e., a ring) may be disposed annularly about the lower portion <b>1240</b> of the locator projection <b>1238</b> and compressed between the locator projection <b>1238</b> and the openings <b>1242</b> to further secure the hinge <b>1223</b> in place on the docking station <b>1230</b>. While <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>48</b></figref> shows the docking station <b>1230</b> having two locator projections <b>1238</b>, it should be understood that the docking station <b>1230</b> may include more or fewer locator projections <b>1238</b> or may engage the hinge <b>1223</b> in a fixed orientation in other ways.</p>
<p id="p-0158" num="0157">A plurality of electrical contacts <b>1244</b> extend generally upward and away from the upper surface <b>1236</b> of the docking body <b>1232</b>, where each electrical contact <b>1244</b> is configured to engage a corresponding electrical contact <b>1246</b> recessed in a cylindrical opening formed in the hinge <b>1223</b>. The electrical contacts <b>1244</b> are provided in a recess <b>1245</b> formed in the upper surface <b>1236</b> of the docking body <b>1232</b>, protecting the electrical contacts <b>1244</b> from damage when the hinge <b>1223</b> is not installed on the docking station <b>1230</b>. The electrical contacts <b>1244</b> define a height less than a height of the locator projections <b>1238</b>, such that the hinge <b>1223</b> may first be located and positioned in a lateral direction on the locator projections <b>1238</b> and lowered into engagement with the lower portion <b>1240</b> of the locator projections <b>1238</b> before receiving and engaging the electrical contacts <b>1244</b> in the openings having the electrical contacts <b>1246</b>. A gasket <b>1247</b> may be disposed annularly about the electrical contact <b>1244</b> and compressed between the electrical contact <b>1244</b> and a portion of the hinge <b>1223</b> defining an electrical contact opening to further secure the hinge <b>1223</b> in place on the docking station <b>1230</b>. The gasket <b>1247</b> may further seal the electrical connection between the docking station <b>1230</b> and the hinge <b>1223</b>, protecting the electrical contacts <b>1244</b>, <b>1246</b> from introduction of water from the nearby toilet bowl <b>101</b>. While <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>48</b></figref> shows the docking station <b>1230</b> having two electrical contacts <b>1244</b>, it should be understood that the docking station <b>1230</b> may include more or fewer electrical contacts <b>1244</b>. While <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>48</b>-<b>50</b></figref> show the locator projections <b>1238</b> and the electrical contacts <b>1244</b> formed as part of the docking station <b>1230</b> and the openings <b>1242</b> and the electrical contact <b>1246</b> openings formed as part of the hinge <b>1223</b>, it should be understood that the locator projections <b>1238</b> and the electrical contacts <b>1244</b> may extend from the hinge <b>1223</b> and the openings <b>1242</b> and the electrical openings <b>1246</b> may be formed from the docking station <b>1230</b> according to other exemplary embodiments.</p>
<p id="p-0159" num="0158">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>48</b> and <b>49</b></figref>, the electrical wiring <b>1209</b> is shown in more detail. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>49</b></figref>, the lower surface <b>1234</b> of the docking body <b>1232</b> defines a first channel <b>1235</b> extending laterally therethrough. The first channel <b>1235</b> is configured to receive the electrical wiring <b>1209</b>, such that the electrical wiring <b>1209</b> can be concealed within the docking station <b>1230</b>. The electrical wiring <b>1209</b> includes a first electrical wire <b>1248</b> extending through the bore <b>1210</b> of one of the hollow fasteners <b>1207</b>, through the first channel <b>1235</b>, and electrically coupled to one of the (e.g., a first) electrical contacts <b>1244</b> at the lower surface <b>1234</b>. A through hole <b>1250</b> extends from the upper surface <b>1236</b> of the docking body <b>1232</b> to the first channel <b>1235</b>. The first electrical wire <b>1248</b> passes through the through hole <b>1250</b> in order to be positioned in the first channel <b>1235</b>. A second channel <b>1237</b> is formed in the upper surface <b>1236</b> of the docking body <b>1232</b> and extends from a rear edge <b>1233</b> of the docking body <b>1232</b> to the first channel <b>1235</b>, through the through hole <b>1250</b>. A second electrical wire <b>1249</b> extends from the rear edge <b>1233</b> of the docking body <b>1232</b>, through the second channel <b>1237</b> and the first channel <b>1235</b>, and electrically couples to another of the (e.g., a second) electrical contacts <b>1244</b>. A channel cover <b>1252</b> is disposed on the upper surface <b>1236</b> of the docking body <b>1232</b> across at least a portion of the second channel <b>1237</b> after the second electrical wire <b>1249</b> is inserted into the second channel <b>1237</b>, such that the second electrical wire <b>1249</b> is secured in place, even when the second electrical wire <b>1249</b> is pulled away from the docking station <b>1230</b>. At least one of the first or second electrical wires <b>1248</b>, <b>1249</b> is connected to the power source to power electrical components in the toilet seat assembly <b>1202</b>. Similarly, at least one of the first or second wires <b>1248</b>, <b>1249</b> is connected to a controller for controlling a function or operation of the hinge <b>1223</b>, as discussed above.</p>
<p id="p-0160" num="0159">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>50</b></figref>, the hinge <b>1223</b> is shown according to an exemplary embodiment. The fixed body <b>1224</b> forms a portion of the hinge <b>1223</b> that defines the openings <b>1242</b> and the electrical contact openings <b>1246</b>. A cover <b>1226</b> is formed around the fixed body <b>1224</b> and is configured to conceal the docking station <b>1230</b> when the hinge <b>1223</b> is installed on the docking station <b>1230</b>. The cover <b>1226</b> includes a wall <b>1254</b> extending downward at an outer periphery of the cover <b>1226</b>, enclosing the fixed body <b>1224</b>. The wall <b>1254</b> may define a profile complementary to or larger than an outer periphery of the docking station <b>1230</b>, such that the docking station <b>1230</b> fits inside and may be completely enclosed by the cover <b>1226</b>. A through hole (i.e., second through hole) <b>1258</b> is formed in a rear edge <b>1259</b> of the wall <b>1254</b> and is aligned with the second channel <b>1237</b> of the docking body <b>1232</b>, such that the second electrical wire <b>1249</b> may extend through the wall <b>1254</b> for being plugged in outside the hinge <b>1223</b>. Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>51</b></figref>, the hinge <b>1223</b> is shown installed on the docking station <b>1230</b>. In this configuration, the wall <b>1254</b> extends level with or below the lower surface <b>1234</b> of the docking body <b>1232</b>, such that the entire docking station <b>1230</b> is concealed from view. As discussed above, when the hinge <b>1223</b> is installed on the docking station <b>1230</b>, the second electrical wire <b>1249</b> extends outward from the rear edge <b>1259</b> of the wall <b>1254</b> through the through hole <b>1258</b> for connection to a power source, controller, etc.</p>
<p id="p-0161" num="0160">Referring again to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>50</b></figref>, a portion of the cover <b>1226</b> disposed between the fixed body <b>1224</b> and the rear edge <b>1259</b> of the wall <b>1254</b> is raised above (e.g., further away from the bowl <b>101</b>) a lower surface <b>1225</b> of the fixed body <b>1224</b>, such that a cavity is formed between the cover <b>1226</b> and the upper surface <b>1236</b> of the docking body <b>1232</b> when the hinge <b>1223</b> is installed on the docking station <b>1230</b>, such that there is space between the upper surface <b>1236</b> and the cover <b>1226</b> for the first electrical wire <b>1248</b> or other wires that extend above the docking body <b>1232</b>. According to an exemplary embodiment, the fixed body <b>1224</b> and the cover <b>1226</b> may be integrally formed as part of the hinge <b>1223</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0162" num="0161">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>51</b></figref>, the hinge <b>1223</b> is installed on the docking station <b>1230</b>. In this configuration, the docking station <b>1230</b> is coupled to the bowl <b>101</b> with the hinge locks <b>1203</b>, which may alternatively be any of the quick-connect hinge locks discussed in the present application or may include a conventional fastener. As the hinge <b>1223</b> is lowered onto the docking station <b>1230</b>, the openings <b>1242</b> engage the ends <b>1239</b> of the locator projections <b>1238</b>, limiting lateral movement of the hinge <b>1223</b> relative to the docking station <b>1230</b>. As the hinge <b>1223</b> is further lowered, the openings <b>1242</b> engage the lower portion <b>1240</b> of the locator projections <b>1238</b> and are press-fit onto the locator projections <b>1238</b> by compressing the gasket <b>1241</b>. Similarly, the electrical contact openings <b>1246</b> are press-fit onto the electrical contacts <b>1244</b> by compressing the gaskets <b>1247</b>. This press-fit arrangement holds the hinge <b>1223</b> securely on the docking station <b>1230</b>. For example, friction between the sidewalls of the openings <b>1242</b> and the gaskets <b>1241</b> or between the sidewalls of the electrical contact openings <b>1246</b> and the gaskets <b>1247</b> prevents the hinge <b>1223</b> from being pulled up from the docking station <b>1230</b>. However, the size (e.g., diameter) of the gaskets <b>1241</b>, <b>1247</b> may be selected, such that a user may overcome the friction to remove the hinge <b>1223</b> from the docking station <b>1230</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0163" num="0162">The electrical contacts <b>1244</b> may be removed from the electrical contact openings <b>1246</b> by lifting the hinge <b>1223</b> away from the docking station <b>1230</b> in order to separate the hinge <b>1223</b> from the docking station <b>1230</b>. The configurations shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>48</b>-<b>51</b></figref> allows a user to completely remove the seat <b>1221</b>, the lid <b>1222</b>, and the hinge <b>1223</b> to provide better access for cleaning the entire exposed surface of the bowl <b>101</b>, whereas traditional powered toilet seats cannot be removed for cleaning without also disconnecting and reconnecting wires. This configuration saves time during cleaning and improves the ability to thoroughly disinfect a surface of the toilet.</p>
<p id="p-0164" num="0163">While <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>48</b>-<b>51</b></figref> show the hinge <b>1223</b> being supplied power from an external power supply through direct electrical contact, it should be understood that the hinge <b>1223</b> may be powered in other ways. For example, the docking station <b>1230</b> may include a battery configuration substantially similar to the battery <b>806</b> described above with respect to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>32</b></figref>, <b>35</b>, and <b>36</b>. In this configuration, the docking station <b>1230</b> may still use electrical wires <b>1209</b> to connect to a controller for operating the hinge <b>1223</b>, but may not require a wired connection to an external power source. Power is then transferred from the battery <b>806</b>, through the electrical contacts <b>1244</b> to the hinge <b>1223</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0165" num="0164">While <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>48</b>-<b>51</b></figref> show the docking station <b>1230</b> being connected to a hinge <b>1223</b>, it should be recognized that the configuration of the docking station <b>1230</b> may be used to connect to other devices. For example, the docking station <b>1230</b> may support and be connected to a toilet seat lighting apparatus as set forth in U.S. patent application Ser. No. 15/425,783, filed Feb. 6, 2017, the entire disclosure of which is incorporated by reference herein. According to another example, the docking station <b>1230</b> may support and be connected to a cleaning system or accessory as set forth in U.S. patent application Ser. No. 15/245,996, filed Aug. 24, 2016. The docking station <b>1230</b> may further be used to supply power to a seat heater, powered bidet structure (e.g., for extending and retracting a bidet wand), or other accessory. According to another exemplary embodiment, the docking station <b>1230</b> may supply power to an outlet (e.g., USB port) formed in the toilet or as part of a toilet accessory for supplying power to a device.</p>
<p id="p-0166" num="0165">According to another exemplary embodiment, the hinge <b>1223</b> may be electrically connected to the docking station <b>1230</b> without a direct physical electrical connection. For example, the docking station <b>1230</b> may include a first inductor coil and the hinge <b>1223</b> may include a second inductor coil. The first inductor coil is connected to a power source (e.g., external power supply, battery, etc.) and transfers power through induction to the second inductor coil. In this configuration, the locator projections <b>1238</b> may hold the hinge <b>1223</b> securely on the docking station <b>1230</b> without the electrical contacts <b>1244</b>. The hinge <b>1223</b> may then be operated wirelessly, as discussed above, or may be connected to a controller through the electrical contacts <b>1244</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0167" num="0166">While the docking station <b>1230</b> may be used to inductively provide power to the hinge <b>1223</b>, it should also be understood that the docking station <b>1230</b> may inductively power or charge other accessories or devices (e.g., mobile device). For example, the docking station <b>1230</b> may be positioned on the bowl <b>101</b> in a position, such that a user may place an induction charge-capable device thereon for charging. For example, the docking station <b>1230</b> may be coupled to a lid for the tank <b>103</b>, such that the user may place the device on top of the docking station <b>1230</b> for charging. In configurations where the docking station <b>1230</b> is not enclosed by the hinge <b>1223</b>, a cover may be disposed on the docking station <b>1230</b>, which allows for induction currents to pass therethrough and enclose the docking station <b>1230</b> to protect the docking station <b>1230</b> from water and other damage. According to another exemplary embodiment, the docking station <b>1230</b> may be coupled to an underside of the lid or another surface of the toilet that is concealed from view (e.g., inside the pedestal). In this configuration, induction currents pass through the toilet surface (e.g., bowl <b>101</b>, tank lid) to provide inductive charging to a device through the toilet surface. For example, a user may place the device directly on the tank lid or other surface and charge or power the device through induction currents passed from the concealed docking station <b>1230</b>, through the toilet surface, to the device.</p>
<p id="p-0168" num="0167">Referring now to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>102</b></figref>, the hinge <b>1223</b> is shown according to another exemplary embodiment. The wall <b>1254</b> of the cover <b>1226</b> includes opposing first and second lateral sides <b>1255</b>, <b>1256</b>, which may be exposed when the toilet seat assembly <b>1202</b> is installed. A through hole <b>1257</b> extends through each of the sides <b>1255</b>, <b>1256</b>, proximate the openings <b>1242</b>. In this configuration, the through holes <b>1257</b> provide access to an interior of the cover <b>1226</b> from a position external to the cover <b>1226</b>, as will be described in further detail below. The through holes <b>1257</b> are positioned in the sides <b>1255</b>, <b>1256</b>, such that the through holes <b>1257</b> are visible when the seat <b>1221</b> and/or the lid <b>1222</b> are in either or both of the open and closed positions (e.g., as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>48</b></figref>). The through hole <b>1257</b> formed in the first side <b>1255</b> defines a first axis A-A extending substantially perpendicularly to the first wall <b>1255</b>. Similarly, the through hole <b>1257</b> formed in the second side <b>1256</b> defines a second axis B-B extending substantially perpendicularly to the second wall <b>1256</b>. The first axis A-A and the second axis B-B may be collinear or substantially parallel. While <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>102</b></figref> shows the through holes <b>1257</b> extending through the first and second side <b>1255</b>, <b>1256</b>, it should be understood that the through holes <b>1257</b> may be formed other portions of the wall <b>1254</b> of the cover <b>1226</b> (e.g., a forward portion or a rear portion), such that the through holes <b>1257</b> are accessible to a user when the toilet seat assembly <b>1202</b> is installed. A stop <b>1261</b> is formed in the interior portion of the cover <b>1226</b> along each of the first axis A-A and the second axis B-B, opposing the through holes <b>1257</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0169" num="0168">A receiving opening <b>1243</b> is formed in the cover <b>1226</b> to correspond with each of the openings <b>1242</b>, discussed with respect to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>50</b></figref>. Referring still to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>102</b></figref>, a plurality of mounting openings <b>1260</b> (i.e., bores) are formed in the cover <b>1226</b> about each of the receiving openings <b>1243</b>. For example, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>102</b></figref> shows two mounting openings <b>1260</b> disposed on laterally opposing sides of each receiving opening <b>1243</b>. The mounting openings <b>1260</b> may be threaded or may be formed from a plastic or other deformable material, such that when a screw is received in the mounting openings <b>1260</b>, the screw forms threads within the mounting openings <b>1260</b> and is securely received therein. According to other exemplary embodiments, the mounting openings <b>1260</b> may be formed in other ways or locations in the cover <b>1226</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0170" num="0169">Referring now to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>103</b> and <b>104</b></figref>, a quick release assembly <b>2000</b> is shown according to an exemplary embodiment. The assembly <b>2000</b> includes a body <b>2002</b> defining an upper surface <b>2004</b>, a lower surface <b>2006</b>, and a bore <b>2008</b> extending vertically through the body <b>2002</b> from the upper surface <b>2004</b> to the lower surface <b>2006</b>. According to an exemplary embodiment, the bore <b>2008</b> is substantially the same as or corresponds to the opening <b>1242</b> discussed in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>50</b></figref> and is configured to receive a locator projection <b>1238</b> therein. The upper surface <b>2004</b> and the lower surface <b>2006</b> each include a projection <b>2010</b> extending vertically outward therefrom, further defining the bore <b>2008</b>. It should be understood that with respect to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>103</b> and <b>104</b></figref>, the term &#x201c;vertically&#x201d; corresponds to the axial direction defined by the bore <b>2008</b> and the term &#x201c;laterally&#x201d; corresponds to the radial direction defined by the bore <b>2008</b>. According to an exemplary embodiment, when the assembly <b>2000</b> is installed on the cover <b>1226</b>, the projection <b>2010</b> on the upper surface <b>2004</b> is received in the receiving opening <b>1243</b> in order to locate the assembly <b>2000</b> in the cover <b>1226</b>. The upper surface <b>2004</b> further defines a plurality of openings <b>2012</b> corresponding to the mounting openings <b>1260</b> formed in the cover <b>1226</b>. In this configuration, a fastener (e.g., a screw) is passed through the openings <b>2012</b> and received in the mounting openings <b>1260</b> in order to couple the body <b>2002</b> of the assembly <b>2000</b> to the cover <b>1226</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0171" num="0170">The body <b>2002</b> defines a channel <b>2014</b> (i.e., a slot), which extends from an exterior surface of the body <b>2002</b> laterally into the bore <b>2008</b>. The assembly <b>2000</b> further includes a sliding member <b>2016</b> received in the channel <b>2014</b>, which is configured to engage a protruding portion of the locator projection <b>1238</b> (e.g., the gasket <b>1241</b>, the end <b>1239</b>, or other portion) with an interference fit. Specifically, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>103</b></figref>, the sliding member <b>2016</b> defines an elongate pin <b>2018</b> and an arm <b>2020</b> extending laterally outward from the pin <b>2018</b>. The entire arm <b>2020</b> and a portion of the pin <b>2018</b> are disposed in the channel <b>2014</b> when the sliding member <b>2016</b> is received in the channel <b>2014</b>. The arm <b>2020</b> defines a locking opening <b>2022</b>, which includes an irregular shape having a first portion <b>2024</b> defining a first diameter and a second portion <b>2026</b> laterally offset from the first portion <b>2024</b> and defining a second diameter less than the first diameter. A sliding axis C-C is defined along the pin <b>2018</b> and the sliding member <b>2016</b> is configured to move laterally along the sliding axis C-C when the sliding member <b>2016</b> is installed in the body <b>2002</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0172" num="0171">Referring still to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>103</b> and <b>104</b></figref>, the assembly <b>2000</b> includes a cover <b>2028</b> disposed on a side of the body <b>2002</b> and configured to enclose the channel <b>2014</b>. When the cover <b>2028</b> is installed on the body <b>2002</b>, the cover <b>2028</b> prevents the sliding member <b>2016</b> from being withdrawn from the channel <b>2014</b>, while allowing the sliding member <b>2016</b> to continue to slide along the sliding axis C-C.</p>
<p id="p-0173" num="0172">A spring <b>2030</b> (i.e., a biasing member) is disposed on a first end <b>2032</b> of the pin <b>2018</b> and a cap <b>2034</b> is disposed on an opposing second end <b>2036</b> of the pin <b>2018</b>. The spring <b>2030</b> extends along the sliding axis C-C. When the assembly <b>2000</b> is installed in a cover <b>1226</b>, the sliding axis C-C is aligned (e.g., collinear) with the corresponding first axis A-A or second axis B-B. In this configuration, the spring <b>2030</b> engages and is compressed between the stop <b>1261</b> and the first end <b>2032</b> of the pin <b>2018</b>, such that the sliding member <b>2016</b> is biased away from the stop <b>1261</b> and toward the corresponding through hole <b>1257</b>. When the spring <b>2030</b> is in an uncompressed (i.e., extended) configuration, the sliding member <b>2016</b> is in a first (i.e., locked) position, in which the cap <b>2034</b> extends through the corresponding through hole <b>1257</b>, such that it is accessible to a user external to the cover <b>1226</b>. A user may then press the cap <b>2034</b>, pushing the cap <b>2034</b> further into the through hole <b>1257</b>, thereby moving the sliding member <b>2016</b> along the sliding axis C-C and compressing the spring <b>2030</b> until the sliding member <b>2016</b> is in a second (i.e., unlocked) position.</p>
<p id="p-0174" num="0173">When the sliding member <b>2016</b> is in the second position, the first portion <b>2024</b> of the locking opening <b>2022</b> is substantially axially aligned with the bore <b>2008</b>. The first portion <b>2024</b> defines a diameter greater than or the same as a widest portion of the locator projection <b>1238</b> received in the bore <b>2008</b>, such that the locator projection <b>1238</b> may move axially in the bore <b>2008</b> without any interference from the sliding member <b>2016</b>. In contrast, when the sliding member <b>2016</b> is in the first position, the second portion <b>2026</b> of the locking opening <b>2022</b> is substantially axially aligned with the bore <b>2008</b>. The second portion <b>2026</b> defines a diameter less than the widest portion of the locator projection <b>1238</b>. Interaction between the second portion <b>2026</b> and the widest or other portion of the locator projection <b>1238</b> having a diameter greater than that of the second portion <b>2026</b> provides an interference fit, locking the locator projection <b>1238</b> in the bore <b>2008</b> and preventing it from being withdrawn therefrom.

According to an exemplary embodiment, when the assembly <b>2100</b> is installed on the cover <b>1226</b>, the projection <b>2110</b> on the upper surface <b>2104</b> is received in the receiving opening <b>1243</b> in order to locate the assembly <b>2100</b> in the cover <b>1226</b>. The upper surface <b>2104</b> further defines a plurality of openings <b>2112</b> corresponding to the mounting openings <b>1260</b> formed in the cover <b>1226</b>. In this configuration, a fastener (e.g., a screw) is passed through the openings <b>2112</b> and received in the mounting openings <b>1260</b> in order to couple the body <b>2102</b> of the assembly <b>2100</b> to the cover <b>1226</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0176" num="0175">The body <b>2102</b> defines at least one channel <b>2114</b> (i.e., a slot), which extends laterally through the bore <b>2108</b>. Specifically, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>105</b></figref>, the body <b>2102</b> defines two channels <b>2114</b>, although more or fewer channels <b>2114</b> may be used. The assembly <b>2100</b> further includes an interference pin <b>2116</b> received in the at least one channel <b>2114</b>, which is configured to engage a protruding portion of the locator projection <b>1238</b> (e.g., the gasket <b>1241</b>, the end <b>1239</b>, or other portion) with an interference fit. The interference pin <b>2116</b> includes two legs <b>2118</b> joined at a first end of each leg <b>2118</b>. Each channel <b>2114</b> is configured to receive one of the legs <b>2118</b> therein. The legs <b>2118</b> then extend through the bore <b>2108</b> and are biased toward the axis of the bore <b>2108</b>. The legs <b>2118</b> are flexible and configured to deflect radially outward relative to the bore <b>2108</b> as locator projection <b>1238</b> is received therein and engages the legs <b>2118</b>. Interaction between the legs <b>2118</b> and a portion of the locator projection <b>1238</b> that suddenly increases in diameter provides an interference fit, locking the locator projection <b>1238</b> in the bore <b>2108</b>. This configuration prevents the locator projection <b>1238</b> from being withdrawn from the bore <b>2108</b> until substantial force is applied to the docking station <b>1230</b> in the vertical direction relative to the bore <b>2108</b>, thereby forcing the legs <b>2118</b> radially outward and overcoming the interference fit.</p>
<p id="p-0177" num="0176">Referring now to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>107</b></figref>, the docking station <b>1230</b> is shown according to another exemplary embodiment.

A nut <b>1262</b> is received on and threadably engages the fastener <b>1207</b> in order to secure the docking station <b>1230</b> to a toilet. The nut <b>1262</b> defines an upper portion <b>1263</b> having a conical shape, a lower portion <b>1265</b> defining opposing wings <b>1266</b> (e.g., as in a conventional wing nut), and a substantially cylindrical intermediate portion <b>1264</b> disposed between the upper portion <b>1263</b> and the lower portion <b>1265</b>.

The conical upper portion <b>1263</b> increases in diameter moving toward the lower portion <b>1265</b>. In this configuration, when the docking station <b>1230</b> is coupled to a toilet, the upper portion <b>1263</b> of the nut <b>1262</b> is received in a corresponding hole defined by a toilet and axially centers the nut <b>1262</b> within the hole, thereby preventing lateral motion of the docking station <b>1230</b> with respect to the toilet.</p>

As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>53</b> and <b>54</b></figref>, the cam lever <b>1301</b> is rotatable about the cam lever pin between a non-locking position (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>53</b> and <b>61</b></figref>) and a locking position (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>54</b> and <b>62</b></figref>). As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>55</b></figref>, the cam levers <b>1301</b> are in the non-locking (e.g., upright) position, and the installation begins with insertion of the expandable anchors (e.g., the semi-rigid sleeve <b>1306</b> and the viscoelastic sleeve <b>1307</b>) through the seat post holes in the toilet (e.g., vitreous). Then, the cam levers <b>1301</b> (and connected components) are rotated downward to lift the bottom anchor nut <b>1308</b> to expand the sleeves <b>1306</b>, <b>1307</b> to the toilet's associated seat post hole diameter, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>56</b> and <b>57</b></figref>.

<p id="p-0180" num="0179">Prior to locking the cams inwardly, torque resistance increases due to compression of the flexible rubber-like crush ribs <b>1310</b> (see <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>60</b></figref>) and the recess geometry provides feedback to the user to limit the system from being over tightened. The flexible rubber-like crush ribs <b>1310</b> shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>60</b></figref> create torsional resistance due to friction to indicate the system is approaching proper hand tightness. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>59</b></figref>, the recess/interlocking geometries (e.g., between the mount <b>1304</b> and/or the gasket <b>1305</b> and the cup <b>1324</b> in the hinge base <b>1323</b> that receives them) limit the vertical compression to ensure proper vertical pin <b>1303</b> movement when the cam levers <b>1301</b> are closed. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>57</b></figref> shows the cam levers <b>1301</b> closed (e.g., in the locking position). In the locking position, the cam lever <b>1301</b> is configured to go past the horizontal plane, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>54</b></figref>, to require a counter rotation force to cam past and release from the locked position. A locking cam <b>1311</b> of the cam lever <b>1301</b> is shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>60</b></figref> as extending beyond the axis of rotation of the pin <b>1303</b>, such that when the cam lever <b>1301</b> is rotated into the locking position, the locking cam <b>1311</b> engages and compresses the mount <b>1304</b> to create a locking force. The illustrated cam lever <b>1301</b> includes two locking cams <b>1311</b>, one on each side of the cam screw <b>1302</b>. The cam lever pin <b>1303</b> location relative to the cam mount <b>1304</b> creates the vertical translation through contact between each locking cam <b>1311</b> and the cam mount <b>1304</b>, which creates the forces for securing the assembly <b>1300</b> in place. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>61</b> and <b>62</b></figref> show the relative vertical translation of the cam screw <b>1302</b> from the contact between the locking cams <b>1311</b> of the cam lever <b>1301</b> and the cam mount <b>1304</b>. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>58</b></figref>, after the cam levers <b>1301</b> are closed, an aesthetic hinge cover <b>1325</b> is rotated closed for a clean appearance that keeps dirt and debris outside of the hinge assembly. It is noted that the hinge cover <b>1325</b> can be configured according to the one-piece (e.g., unitary) hinge base disclosed below in, for example, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>97</b>-<b>100</b></figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0181" num="0180">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>63</b></figref>, a top of the viscoelastic sleeve <b>1307</b> is coupled to the bottom (e.g., underside) of the hinge mount or cup <b>1324</b> of the hinge base <b>1323</b>, which advantageously enables the cam assembly to stay attached to the hinge assembly and ship together prior to installation. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>64</b>-<b>68</b></figref> illustrate alternative variants to the assembly <b>1300</b> shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>63</b></figref>.

The remaining components/parts of the assembly <b>1330</b> are the same as those in the assembly <b>1300</b>. The assembly <b>1330</b> advantageously reduces the number of parts, which reduces the piece cost and assembly cost/time. This arrangement also enables the cam assembly to be a loose assembly that does not have to be assembled prior to shipment of the seat assembly. The assembly <b>1360</b> shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>65</b></figref> has the top <b>1367</b><i>a </i>of the viscoelastic sleeve <b>1367</b> below the hinge mount <b>1324</b> so that the top <b>1367</b><i>a </i>couples to the underside of the bottom of the hinge mount <b>1324</b>, and the semi-rigid sleeve <b>1366</b> is integrally formed with (e.g., co-molded onto, is the same part as, etc.) the cam mount <b>1364</b>. This arrangement enables the cam assembly to stay attached to the hinge assembly and ship together prior to install, while lowering the cost. The assembly <b>1390</b> shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>66</b>-<b>68</b></figref> has a unitary (e.g., integral) semi-rigid sleeve <b>1396</b> and cam mount <b>1394</b>, which can be formed (e.g., molded) as one part. The viscoelastic sleeve <b>1397</b> and the mount gasket <b>1395</b> are integrally formed (e.g., molded together) with the mount gasket material (e.g., to form one entire &#x201c;boot&#x201d;) or can be made via a two-shot molding and bonded onto the cam mount. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>68</b></figref>, the co-molded semi-rigid sleeve <b>1396</b> can be molded with sacrificial &#x201c;runner-like&#x201d; geometries, such as the webs <b>1396</b><i>a </i>shown, for molding, which could be designed to break after the rubber overmold (e.g., viscoelastic sleeve <b>1397</b>, mount gasket <b>1395</b>) is applied to allow for lateral (e.g., side-to-side, fore-and-aft) adjustability in the final assembly. This arrangement enables the cam assembly to have a reduced number of parts and the assembly can ship together prior to installation or separately depending on when the cam screw is inserted (sleeve will collapse if screw is missing).</p>
<p id="p-0182" num="0181"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>69</b>-<b>74</b></figref> illustrate an exemplary embodiment of a hinge assembly <b>1400</b> that is configured to mount a hinge base <b>1423</b> to a pedestal of a toilet.

As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>70</b></figref>, a flexible gasket <b>1405</b> (e.g., including a rubber or rubber-like material) can be applied under the hinge mount <b>1401</b>, such as on the topside and inside of the post holes/walls of the toilet base/bowl <b>101</b> (e.g., the vitreous) to resist movement and allow for a secure and lesser clamp load installations. To install the seat, the hinge mount <b>1401</b> is located in a mount or cup <b>1424</b> of the hinge base <b>1423</b> with the fastener <b>1403</b> extending through a bore <b>1406</b> in the hinge mount <b>1401</b> (see <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>70</b></figref>) and with the fastener <b>1403</b> threaded to the anchor <b>1404</b>. Then the lock cap <b>1402</b> is rotated closed (e.g., in the counterclockwise direction as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>71</b></figref>) so that a finger <b>1407</b> of the lock cap <b>1402</b> moves toward a finger <b>1425</b> of the hinge base <b>1423</b>, in which the varying thickness in the annular vertical wall <b>1408</b> of the lock cap <b>1402</b> aligns and blocks one or more flexible or compliant features, shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>69</b></figref> as cantilevered tabs <b>1426</b>, of the hinge base <b>1423</b> from being moved to a position that would allow the hinge mount <b>1401</b> and lock cap <b>1402</b> to be removed. Thus, the hinge mount <b>1401</b> is thereby retained by and secured to the hinge base <b>1423</b>, such that the hinge mount <b>1401</b> cannot be moved vertically relative to the hinge base <b>1423</b>. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>73</b></figref>, the annular vertical wall <b>1408</b> of the lock cap <b>1402</b> includes thin sections <b>1409</b> and thick sections <b>1410</b> at various (e.g., alternating) locations circumferentially around the wall <b>1408</b>. When the thin sections <b>1409</b> of the wall <b>1408</b> are located between (e.g., aligned radially with) the tabs <b>1426</b> and an outer wall <b>1427</b> of the cup <b>1424</b>, then the lock cap <b>1402</b> can be removed axially (e.g., vertically, along the longitudinal axis of the threaded portion of the fastener <b>1403</b>) from the cup <b>1424</b> of the hinge base <b>1423</b>. When the thick sections <b>1410</b> of the wall <b>1408</b> are located between the tabs <b>1426</b> and the outer wall <b>1427</b> of the cup <b>1424</b>, then the lock cap <b>1402</b> is retained in place axially (i.e., the lock cap <b>1402</b> resists being removed or moved axially), thereby retaining the hinge mount <b>1401</b> in place as well. Also shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>73</b></figref>, the lock cap <b>1402</b> includes a channel <b>1411</b> between the finger <b>1407</b> and the wall <b>1408</b> for receiving the outer wall <b>1427</b> of the cup <b>1424</b>. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>71</b> and <b>72</b></figref>, the hinge cover <b>1428</b> of the hinge base <b>1423</b> can be rotated to the covered position (i.e., covering the hinge assembly) to provide an aesthetic improvement. The hinge cover <b>1428</b> and the lock cap <b>1402</b> can be configured such that moving the hinge cover <b>1428</b> to the covered position can force the lock cap <b>1402</b> to fully close or close far enough to be fully secured in the event that the lock cap <b>1402</b> was not fully rotated. This ensures the seat is secured even when an installer does not rotate the cap lock <b>1402</b> far enough to be fully secured. When in the covered position, the hinge cover <b>1428</b> also prevents the twist lock cap <b>1402</b> from accidently rotating toward the open (e.g., non-locking) position to prevent the lock cap <b>1402</b> and assembly form becoming unsecured.</p>
<p id="p-0183" num="0182"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>111</b>-<b>116</b></figref> illustrate an exemplary embodiment of a hinge assembly <b>1430</b> that is configured to mount to a toilet pedestal.

Each hinge lock includes a hinge mount <b>1431</b>, a lock cap <b>1432</b> (e.g., lock cover), a fastener such as the fastener <b>1403</b> (not shown for clarity), an anchor such as the anchor <b>1404</b> (not shown for clarity), and a flexible gasket <b>1435</b> (e.g., including a rubber or rubber-like material, such as a TPE), which is disposed on the hinge mount <b>1401</b>, such as by overmolding. Each hinge mount <b>1431</b> has an annular base <b>1437</b> and a shoulder <b>1438</b>, which extends upwardly from a top of the base <b>1437</b> and has a size (e.g., diameter) that is smaller than the base <b>1437</b>, such that the portion of the base <b>1437</b> that extends radially beyond the shoulder <b>1438</b> is received under the tabs <b>1426</b> of the cup <b>1424</b> and the shoulder <b>1438</b> extends between the tabs <b>1426</b> upon installation. The hinge mount shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>112</b></figref> is in a non-locking position, in which thin sections <b>1439</b> of the lock cap <b>1432</b> are disposed between the tabs <b>1426</b> and outer wall <b>1427</b>. The hinge mount shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>113</b></figref> is in a locking position, in which thick sections <b>1440</b> of the lock cap <b>1432</b> are disposed between the tabs <b>1426</b> and the outer wall <b>1427</b>. One or more locking features, such as detents, can be employed to further retain the thick sections <b>1440</b>. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>113</b></figref>, each detent <b>1429</b> extends radially inward, such as from the outer wall <b>1427</b>, to engage an associated recess <b>1441</b> in the lock cap <b>1432</b>. Rotating the lock cap <b>1432</b> by a predetermined angular rotation moves the hinge mount from the non-locking position to the locking position.</p>

The gasket <b>1435</b> is configured to create user feedback during assembly/installation and a compression fit when rotating the lock cap <b>1432</b> into contact and compression/flexure of flexible features (e.g., tabs <b>1426</b>) of the hinge base <b>1423</b>. The gasket <b>1435</b> also acts as a spring to lessen lift force by flexing the tabs outward when unlocked as well as absorbing tolerances (e.g., &#x201c;slop&#x201d;) within the assembly <b>1430</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0185" num="0184"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>114</b></figref> shows both a single hinge cover <b>1428</b> design, which is configured to cover both hinge locks and both cups <b>1424</b>, as well as two independent hinge covers <b>1428</b>&#x2032;, each of which covers one hinge lock and one cup <b>1424</b>. Regardless of the single or dual design, the hinge covers <b>1428</b>, <b>1428</b>&#x2032; can be configured to have &#x201c;poke-yoke&#x201d; features that help ensure each hinge lock is in the locked position and installed correctly.

The mount gasket <b>1503</b> can be formed separately or integrally formed (e.g., overmolded) with one or more of the other components of the assembly <b>1500</b>. The expandable anchor assembly (e.g., flexible mount gasket <b>1503</b>, semi-rigid mount sleeve <b>1504</b>) is inserted into the vitreous <b>101</b> through the seat post hole from the top. The mount gasket <b>1503</b> provides resistance via friction and resists the mount sleeve <b>1504</b> from rotating, which also prohibits the anchor <b>1505</b> from rotating.

<p id="p-0197" num="0196"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>96</b></figref> illustrates an alternative variant to the mounting assembly <b>1800</b>. As shown, the mounting assembly <b>1850</b> includes an integrated mount and gasket, the anchor <b>1802</b>, and the screw <b>1804</b>. The integrated mount and gasket includes a mount portion <b>1851</b>, which is the same as the mount <b>1801</b>, and a gasket portion <b>1853</b>, which is the same as the gasket <b>1803</b>. The rubber like gasket portion <b>1853</b> (e.g., gasket/sleeve) can be integrally formed with/onto the mount portion <b>1851</b> through a process (e.g., two-shot molding, insert molding, etc.). Overmolding the gasket portion <b>1853</b> onto the mount portion <b>1851</b> removes the gasket assembly process and allows for secure gasket fit during the seat installation process.</p>
<p id="p-0198" num="0197"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>97</b>-<b>100</b></figref> illustrate an exemplary embodiment of a one-piece (e.g., unitary) hinge base <b>1020</b> that includes a base member <b>1021</b>, first and second mounts <b>1022</b> extending from a front wall <b>1023</b> of the base member <b>1021</b> proximate first and second opposite ends <b>1024</b>, <b>1025</b>, a first cover <b>1026</b> coupled to the first mount <b>1022</b> through a first living hinge <b>1027</b>, a second cover <b>1026</b> coupled to the second mount <b>1022</b> through a second living hinge <b>1027</b>, and a bottom cover <b>1028</b> coupled to the base member <b>1021</b> (e.g., a bottom of the front wall <b>1023</b>) through a third living hinge <b>1029</b>. It is noted that when installed with a toilet, the front wall <b>1023</b> typically faces rearward toward a toilet tank, if provided, although the front wall <b>1023</b> could be configured to face forward toward the bowl. The base member <b>1021</b>, each mount <b>1022</b>, and/or each cover <b>1026</b> can be made according to any of the embodiments disclosed herein. The illustrated base member <b>1021</b> includes the front wall <b>1023</b>, sides, a top wall, and a rear wall. Each illustrated mount <b>1022</b> includes a cup having a rear coupled to the front wall <b>1023</b>, an opening to receive a mounting assembly or hinge lock assembly and a front coupled to the associated living hinge <b>1027</b>. Each illustrated cover <b>1026</b> includes front coupled to the associated living hinge <b>1027</b>, opposing sides, and a top interconnected with the sides and front. Each cover can include one or more posts extending away from an underside of the top, where each post engages an associated bore in the associated mount <b>1022</b> to secure the cover in the closed position with the mount <b>1022</b>. A pivot member <b>1010</b> is located in each side of the base member <b>1021</b> to pivotally couple a seat and/or a seat lid to the hinge base <b>1020</b>. The bottom cover <b>1028</b>, as shown, extends between the first and second mounts <b>1022</b> and, therefore, has a lateral length or width that is shorter than a lateral length or width of the base member <b>1021</b> due to the mounts <b>1022</b>. This arrangement advantageously places the living hinge <b>1029</b> on the same side of the base member <b>1021</b> as the mounts <b>1022</b>, so that if the mounts <b>1022</b> face rearward (e.g., away from the bowl and toward a tank) in an installed position with a toilet (e.g., pedestal), then the living hinge <b>1029</b> is relatively concealed from view by users of the toilet, which is advantageous from an aesthetics perspective. Alternatively, the bottom cover <b>1028</b> and living hinge <b>1029</b> can be molded on the side of the base member <b>1021</b> that is opposite to the mounts <b>1022</b>. For this arrangement, the lateral length of the bottom cover <b>1028</b> can extend up to (or beyond) the lateral length of the base member <b>1021</b> to thereby give the bottom cover <b>1028</b> up to the same size &#x201c;footprint&#x201d; as the base member <b>1021</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0199" num="0198">The first and second living hinges <b>1027</b> allow for the first and second covers <b>1026</b> to remain coupled to the base member <b>1021</b> during shipping and installation, while allowing each cover <b>1026</b> to be rotated to a covering (e.g., closed) position onto the associated mount <b>1022</b>. The third living <b>1029</b> hinge allows for the bottom cover <b>1028</b> to remain coupled to the base member <b>1021</b> during shipping and installation for case, while allowing the bottom cover <b>1028</b> to be rotated to an installation position under the base member <b>1021</b> and on the toilet pedestal or bowl (e.g., an upper surface of the vitreous). The entire unitary hinge base <b>1020</b> can be formed of a common material. Alternatively, one or more of the living hinges <b>1027</b>, <b>1029</b> can be formed using a material that is different than the material of the base member <b>1021</b>, the bottom cover <b>1028</b>, and/or the mounts <b>1022</b>. For example, the base member <b>1021</b>, the bottom cover <b>1028</b>, and/or the mounts <b>1022</b> can include a material having a relatively high strength (which often results in lower flexibility), whereas each living hinge <b>1027</b>, <b>1029</b> can include a material that has a relatively higher flexibility. In this way the load bearing parts of the unitary hinge base advantageously are made of a stronger material (e.g., higher strength material) and the living hinges are made of a more flexible material to allow the relative movement of the mount covers/bottom cover relative to the base. The two different materials can be formed, for example, using a two-shot molding technique, where all of the elements made with a first material (e.g., the higher strength material) are formed in a first shot (e.g., injection of the first material) and all of the elements made with the second material (e.g., the higher flexibility material) are formed in a second shot (e.g., injection of the second material), such as by overmolding. Moreover, the unitary hinge bases disclosed herein (e.g., hinge base <b>1020</b>) can be made using more than two materials with more than two shots or injections of the more than two materials.</p>
<p id="p-0200" num="0199">The various elements of the unitary hinge base <b>1020</b> can include features that couple (e.g., detachably couple) two or more of the elements of the base <b>1020</b> together. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>100</b></figref>, the bottom cover <b>1028</b> includes a series of ribs <b>1030</b> that engage notched ribs <b>1031</b> (e.g., ribs that includes notches or are separated by notches/recesses) of the base member <b>1021</b> to retain the bottom cover <b>1028</b> is a closed/engaged position with the base member <b>1021</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0201" num="0200"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>101</b></figref> illustrates an exemplary embodiment of a seat assembly <b>1000</b> that includes the unitary hinge base <b>1020</b> (shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>97</b>-<b>100</b></figref>) with a seat <b>1001</b> and a lid <b>1002</b> pivotally coupled thereto. The seat assembly <b>1000</b> can be secured to a toilet pedestal by securing each mount <b>1022</b> with a mounting assembly or hinge lock, such as any of the embodiments disclosed herein.</p>
<p id="p-0202" num="0201"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>57</b> and <b>58</b></figref> illustrate a hinge base <b>1323</b> having a single hinge cover <b>1325</b> that covers both mounts <b>1324</b> (e.g., cups). The single hinge cover <b>1325</b> can be coupled to the base member of the hinge base <b>1323</b> using one or more living hinges, such as or similar to those described above for the hinge base <b>1020</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0203" num="0202"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>108</b>-<b>110</b></figref> illustrate an exemplary embodiment of an anchor assembly <b>2200</b> for connecting a toilet seat assembly (e.g., a hinge thereof) to a toilet (e.g., a toilet base). The anchor assembly <b>2200</b> is configured to enable &#x201c;top mount&#x201d; installation anchoring system that can universally fit with any quick release mount disclosed herein or otherwise, as well as any standard hinge base (not shown), such as the hinge bases disclosed herein. The illustrated anchor assembly <b>2200</b> includes a mount <b>2201</b>, an expandable sleeve <b>2202</b>, a nut anchor <b>2203</b>, and a fastener <b>2204</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0204" num="0203">The illustrated mount <b>2201</b> includes a body <b>2210</b> having a bottom <b>2211</b> that sits on an upper surface (e.g., upper surface <b>111</b>) of a toilet base, a recessed pocket <b>2212</b> in a top, and a through bore <b>2213</b> extending through the body <b>2210</b> (i.e., from the top to the bottom). The through bore <b>2213</b> can be slotted, cylindrical, or have other suitable shapes. The mount <b>2201</b> can be received in or integrally formed with a hinge body, a docking station or other element of a seat assembly, or can be a standalone part. The mount <b>2201</b> can have configurations or features of other embodiments disclosed herein.</p>
<p id="p-0205" num="0204">The illustrated expandable sleeve <b>2202</b> includes an annular base <b>2220</b>, a first pair of fingers <b>2221</b> (e.g., short fingers) extending downwardly from the base <b>2220</b> in a cantilevered arrangement to provide flexibility (e.g., flexure or elastic deformation of the fingers under loading), and a second pair of fingers <b>2222</b> (e.g., long fingers) extending downwardly from the base <b>2220</b> in a cantilevered arrangement to provide flexibility. The first pair of fingers <b>2221</b> oppose one another; and the second pair of fingers <b>2222</b> oppose one another with each finger <b>2222</b> being provided between the first pair of fingers <b>2221</b> (circumferentially around the base <b>2220</b>). For example, the fingers <b>2221</b> can be offset circumferentially by one-hundred and eighty degrees and each finger <b>2222</b> can be offset circumferentially by ninety degrees from each of the fingers <b>2221</b> and offset circumferentially by one-hundred and eighty degrees from the other finger <b>2222</b>. The fingers (e.g., fingers <b>2221</b>, fingers <b>2222</b>) can include helical or annular grooves <b>2223</b>, <b>2224</b> that, if provided, cooperate with the vitreous and/or other components to improve retention.</p>
<p id="p-0206" num="0205">The expandable sleeve <b>2202</b> can optionally include an outer layer <b>2225</b> that can be configured to increase friction. For example, the outer layer <b>2225</b> can be overmolded onto (or formed separately then coupled to) the base <b>2220</b> and/or one or more of the fingers. As shown, the outer layer <b>2225</b> is provided around and below the base <b>2220</b>, around the portions of the long fingers <b>2222</b> between the base <b>2220</b> and the grooves <b>2224</b>, and around the short fingers <b>2221</b> except the grooves <b>2223</b>. The outer layer <b>2225</b> can include, for example, a TPE or similar material.</p>
<p id="p-0207" num="0206">The illustrated nut anchor <b>2203</b> includes an anchor body <b>2230</b> having a generally cylindrical bottom <b>2231</b>, a generally frusto-conical top <b>2232</b>, and two fingers <b>2233</b> extending upwardly from the top <b>2232</b> are two fingers <b>2233</b>, which are shown on opposite sides of the top <b>2232</b>. An outer surface of each finger <b>2233</b> tapers inwardly moving away from the top <b>2232</b>, and each finger <b>2233</b> extends beyond the top <b>2232</b> to engage the sleeve <b>2202</b>, as discussed below. A central bore <b>2234</b> extends through the anchor body <b>2230</b> for receiving the fastener <b>2204</b>. The illustrated nut anchor <b>2203</b> also includes a nut <b>2235</b> disposed in a bore in the bottom <b>2231</b> of the anchor body <b>2230</b>. Rotation of the nut <b>2235</b> relative to the anchor body <b>2230</b> is prevented by the portion of the bottom <b>2231</b> defining the bore. For example, the bore can have a hex shape that compliments a hex shape of the outside of the nut <b>2235</b>. Internal threads of the nut <b>2235</b> thread to threads of the fastener <b>2204</b>. Alternatively, the nut <b>2235</b> can be integrally formed with the anchor body <b>2230</b>, such that the bottom <b>2231</b> of the anchor body <b>2230</b> has a threaded opening for threading to the fastener <b>2204</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0208" num="0207">The fastener <b>2204</b> is shown as a screw having a threaded body <b>2240</b> and a head <b>2241</b> disposed at one end of the body <b>2240</b>. The head <b>2241</b> is received in the recessed pocket <b>2212</b> of the mount <b>2201</b> and the threaded body <b>2240</b> extends through the through bore <b>2213</b>, through an opening in the annular base <b>2220</b>, and through the central bore <b>2234</b> to thread to the internal threads of the nut anchor <b>2203</b> (e.g., threads of the nut <b>2235</b>, threads in the bottom <b>2231</b>). It is noted that the fastener <b>2204</b> can be configured differently and still function as described herein.</p>
<p id="p-0209" num="0208">The anchor assembly <b>2200</b> can optionally include a gasket <b>2205</b> disposed between the mount <b>2201</b> and the toilet base <b>101</b>. As shown, the gasket <b>2205</b> has an annular shape that encircles a top portion of the sleeve <b>2202</b> and is located between the bottom <b>2211</b> of the mount <b>2201</b> and the upper surface <b>111</b> of the toilet base (e.g., vitreous). The gasket <b>2205</b> is configured to be compressible, such as by having a material (e.g., TPE) that compresses.</p>
<p id="p-0210" num="0209">During assembly/installation, the anchor assembly <b>2200</b> is configured to provide a dual compression force for improved performance. During insertion (e.g., of the sleeve <b>2202</b>) into the vitreous (e.g., the seat post hole), the outer diameter of the outer layer <b>2225</b> creates friction and prevents the anchor assembly (e.g., sleeve, nut anchor, etc.) from spinning to ensure that the nut anchor <b>2203</b> lifts and engages expansion sleeve <b>2202</b> when the fastener <b>2204</b> is rotated. By way of example, the outer layer <b>2225</b> can be a TPE material that is &#x201c;sticky&#x201d; by having a low durometer (approximately 50-70 Shore A) to allow sufficient grip and provide easy compression.</p>
<p id="p-0211" num="0210">A majority of the compression loading is intended to be on the portion of the sleeve <b>2202</b>, which is more rigid (e.g., includes a rigid plastic material) to avoid creep (e.g., relaxing over time). The diameter of the vitreous opening and thickness of the vitreous are highly variable and independent, which has led to poor performance of past solutions. To accommodate the range and a semi rigid sleeve material that resists creep, the location (A, B) and reaction angle enables functionality when A or B contact areas create the radial compression. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>109</b> and <b>110</b></figref>, the anchor assembly is configured to provide primary (e.g., underside) compression surfaces A and secondary (e.g., inside) compression surfaces B during installation. Initial contact begins at compression surfaces A. The lower reaction surface angle (45-55 degrees) spreads the flexible features of the sleeve <b>2202</b> at a faster rate than the reaction at surfaces B (70-80 degrees). The faster rate helps create a vertical clamp load to compress the gasket <b>2205</b> and allow the fingers <b>2221</b>, <b>2222</b> of the sleeve <b>2202</b> to bend and create a vertical constraint on the underside of the vitreous.</p>
