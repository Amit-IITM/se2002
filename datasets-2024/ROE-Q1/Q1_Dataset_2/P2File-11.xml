<heading id="h-0011" level="1">EMBODIMENT</heading>
<p id="p-0015" num="0013">Hereinafter, an exemplary embodiment will be described with reference to the drawings.</p>
<heading id="h-0012" level="1">STRUCTURE</heading>
<p id="p-0016" num="0014"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref> is a perspective view illustrating the entire headwear <b>1</b> according to an exemplary embodiment. Headwear <b>1</b> includes crown <b>10</b> and brim <b>20</b>. As used herein, crown <b>10</b> refers to the part of headwear <b>1</b> that covers the wearer's head, i.e., the side and top surfaces of headwear <b>1</b>. Brim <b>20</b> refers to the part of headwear <b>1</b> that protrudes outward from crown <b>10</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0017" num="0015">The fabric of headwear <b>1</b> may be made of cotton, wool, hemp, a plant-based material, or a synthetic fiber such as polyester, and is a textile that forms the outer surface of headwear <b>1</b>. The fabric may be, for example, felt fabric or knitted fabric. The fabric may be made from a single sheet of fabric or made from a plurality of fabric panels <b>11</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0018" num="0016">Crown <b>10</b> of headwear <b>1</b> includes size adjuster <b>30</b> and one or more eyelets <b>40</b>. Crown <b>10</b> is made of a plurality of planar fabric panels <b>11</b> sewn together in-plane.</p>
<p id="p-0019" num="0017">Size adjuster <b>30</b> is a strip of fabric provided on the lower portion of crown <b>10</b>, around the entire circumference or part of the circumference of crown <b>10</b>. Size adjuster <b>30</b> may be attached to the inside of the perimeter forming the lower portion of crown <b>10</b>, and, as illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>, may be integral with crown <b>10</b> so as to form the lower portion of crown <b>10</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0020" num="0018">Note that crown <b>10</b> of headwear <b>1</b> does not include a sweatband. As used herein, a sweatband refers to a strip of fabric provided on the inside of crown <b>10</b>, around the entire circumference of crown <b>10</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0021" num="0019"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref> is a side view illustrating the entire headwear <b>1</b> according to an exemplary embodiment. Size adjuster <b>30</b> may have the shape of a 2 cm wide strip. For example, size adjuster <b>30</b> may be provided on the lower portion of the back of crown <b>10</b>. More specifically, size adjuster <b>30</b> may be provided in an area of crown <b>10</b> where crown <b>10</b> does not contact brim <b>20</b>, in the shape of a 2 cm wide strip at the lower edge of crown <b>10</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0022" num="0020">The one or more eyelets <b>40</b> included in crown <b>10</b> may be provided one per fabric panel <b>11</b> of crown <b>10</b>. For example, when crown <b>10</b> includes six fabric panels <b>11</b>, since each of the six fabric panels <b>11</b> includes one eyelet <b>40</b>, headwear <b>1</b> includes a total of six eyelets <b>40</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0023" num="0021"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref> illustrates the entire circumference of size adjuster <b>30</b> of headwear <b>1</b> according to an exemplary embodiment. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref> is a view of headwear <b>1</b> from below. As illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref>, size adjuster <b>30</b> may be provided around the entire circumference of the lower portion of crown <b>10</b>. For the sake of convenience, size adjuster <b>30</b> is illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref> with its width projected as-is.</p>
<p id="p-0024" num="0022">Size adjuster <b>30</b> may be formed from fabric cut into a strip, and the fabric cut into a strip may be sewn into a casing. Size adjuster <b>30</b> includes, provided in the space defined by the casing formed by the strip of fabric, shape-changing component <b>31</b> that extends in the circumferential direction of crown <b>10</b> by a predetermined length by heat of a predetermined temperature or higher.</p>
<p id="p-0025" num="0023">Stated differently, headwear <b>1</b> includes a strip of fabric sewn so as to form a casing on the lower portion of crown <b>10</b>, and includes a core inside the sewn casing of the strip of fabric. Here, the core is shape-changing component <b>31</b> that extends in the circumferential direction of crown <b>10</b> by a predetermined length by heat of a predetermined temperature or higher.</p>
<p id="p-0026" num="0024">Rather than the circumferential direction of crown <b>10</b>, shape-changing component <b>31</b> may extend in, for example, a direction perpendicular to the circumferential direction of crown <b>10</b>. Shape-changing component <b>31</b> may extend in every direction by heat of a predetermined temperature or higher.</p>
<p id="p-0027" num="0025">Each fabric panel <b>11</b> of crown <b>10</b> and/or the strip of fabric of size adjuster <b>30</b> has a contour and mesh formed by cutting on the bias, and is sewn with an elastic thread. In other words, each fabric panel <b>11</b> of crown <b>10</b> and/or the strip of fabric of size adjuster <b>30</b> is formed using textile cut on the bias.</p>
<p id="p-0028" num="0026">As used herein, cutting on the bias means cutting the fabric at a 45 degree angle relative to the warp or weft. Note that cutting on the bias is not limited to cutting exactly at 45 degrees, and includes cuts made at an angle to the warp or weft. With this, each fabric panel <b>11</b> of crown <b>10</b> and/or the strip of fabric of size adjuster <b>30</b> is more elastic than when cut using a normal cutting method.</p>
<p id="p-0029" num="0027"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b></figref> illustrates shape-changing component <b>31</b> of headwear <b>1</b> according to an exemplary embodiment. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b></figref> is a partial view of only size adjuster <b>30</b> of headwear <b>1</b> and shape-changing component <b>31</b> included in size adjuster <b>30</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0030" num="0028">As described above, shape-changing component <b>31</b> extends in the circumferential direction of crown <b>10</b> by a predetermined length by heat of a predetermined temperature or higher. In other words, shape-changing component <b>31</b> is a component that can change in shape by reaching a predetermined temperature or higher. More specifically, by reaching a predetermined temperature or higher, shape-changing component <b>31</b> can extend in the direction in which tensile force is applied to shape-changing component <b>31</b>. Here, the predetermined temperature may be, for example, 28 degrees Celsius. For example, shape-changing component <b>31</b> starts to soften at 28 degrees Celsius.</p>
<p id="p-0031" num="0029">For example, shape-changing component <b>31</b> may extend a few centimeters to approximately six centimeters in the circumferential direction of crown <b>10</b> in response to body heat from the head of the wearer contacting size adjuster <b>30</b>. Stated differently, shape-changing component <b>31</b> may extend, for example, a few centimeters to approximately six centimeters or more in the circumferential direction of crown <b>10</b> when subjected to a temperature approximately equal to the body temperature of the head of the wearer. In other words, by shape-changing component <b>31</b> extending approximately six centimeters or more, the circumferential size of crown <b>10</b> of headwear <b>1</b> can be changed from approximately 55 centimeters to approximately 61 centimeters, for example.</p>
<p id="p-0032" num="0030">At a predetermined temperature or higher, shape-changing component <b>31</b> extends in the circumferential direction at a rate according to the tensile force applied to shape-changing component <b>31</b> in the circumferential direction. For example, shape-changing component <b>31</b> may extend in the circumferential direction of crown <b>10</b> due to the body heat of the wearer according to the tension in shape-changing component <b>31</b> brought about by the pressure from the wearer's head on size adjuster <b>30</b> when the wearer puts headwear <b>1</b> on their head.</p>
<p id="p-0033" num="0031">For example, when shape-changing component <b>31</b> is subjected to a temperature approximately equal to the body temperature of the wearer's head, size adjuster <b>30</b> extends in the circumferential direction of crown <b>10</b> just long enough in the direction in which size adjuster <b>30</b> is pulled to conform to the wearer's head to allow size adjuster <b>30</b> to conform to the wearer's head.</p>
<p id="p-0034" num="0032">Shape-changing component <b>31</b> remains extended in the circumferential direction of crown <b>10</b> while a temperature greater than or equal to the predetermined temperature is kept constant.</p>
<p id="p-0035" num="0033">For example, since the temperature of shape-changing component <b>31</b> is kept constant at a predetermined temperature or higher by the body heat of the wearer while the wearer's head is contacting size adjuster <b>30</b>, shape-changing component <b>31</b> remains extended in the circumferential direction at a rate according to the tensile force applied to shape-changing component <b>31</b> in the circumferential direction.</p>
<p id="p-0036" num="0034">For example, once shape-changing component <b>31</b> has extended in the circumferential direction of crown <b>10</b> in response to the body heat of the wearer, while size adjuster <b>30</b> is in contact with the wearer's head and subjected to a temperature approximately equal to the body temperature of the wearer's head, shape-changing component <b>31</b> maintains the circumferential extension of crown <b>10</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0037" num="0035">At least one of the following are sewn together using elastic thread <b>32</b>: (1) fabric panels <b>11</b>; (2) crown <b>10</b> and brim <b>20</b>; and (3) crown <b>10</b> and size adjuster <b>30</b>. Headwear <b>1</b> may be sewn together entirely with elastic thread <b>32</b>. As used herein, elastic thread is, for example, woolly thread.</p>
<p id="p-0038" num="0036">With this, when shape-changing component <b>31</b> is extended in the circumferential direction of crown <b>10</b>, even if tension is exerted on size adjuster <b>30</b> and exerted between fabric panels <b>11</b> of crown <b>10</b> that are sewn to size adjuster <b>30</b>, fabric panels <b>11</b> and size adjuster <b>30</b> and the like can extend slightly as a result of elastic thread <b>32</b> stretching. In other words, when shape-changing component <b>31</b> is extended in the circumferential direction of crown <b>10</b>, headwear <b>1</b> can accommodate tension exerted on the entire headwear <b>1</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0039" num="0037">For example, when shape-changing component <b>31</b> is extended in the circumferential direction of crown <b>10</b>, the strip of fabric of size adjuster <b>30</b> extends as shape-changing component <b>31</b> extends. Fabric panels <b>11</b> forming crown <b>10</b> that are stitched to the strip of fabric extend a certain amount as the strip of fabric extends. At this time, elastic thread <b>32</b> that stitches the strip of fabric and fabric panels <b>11</b> together also stretches as the strip of fabric extends. With this, as a result of the entire headwear <b>1</b> extending as shape-changing component <b>31</b> extends, the size of headwear <b>1</b> can be adjusted significantly more than conventional configurations.</p>
<heading id="h-0013" level="1">ADVANTAGES</heading>
<p id="p-0040" num="0038">Headwear <b>1</b> according to an exemplary embodiment includes crown <b>10</b> of planar fabric panels <b>11</b> sewn together in-plane, and brim <b>20</b>. Headwear <b>1</b> includes size adjuster <b>30</b> of a strip of fabric, size adjuster <b>30</b> being provided on a lower portion of crown <b>10</b>, around an entire circumference or part of the circumference of crown <b>10</b>.

<p id="p-0041" num="0039">With this configuration, in headwear <b>1</b> according to an exemplary embodiment, when size adjuster <b>30</b> is subject to a predetermined temperature or higher, size adjuster <b>30</b> can sufficiently extend as a result of shape-changing component <b>31</b> extending by a predetermined length, and the entire headwear <b>1</b> can also sufficiently extend so as to coincide. When shape-changing component <b>31</b> extends by a predetermined length, the extension of headwear <b>1</b> according to an exemplary embodiment coinciding with the extension of shape-changing component <b>31</b> is not hindered by the stitching of all the parts that form headwear <b>1</b>. Accordingly, headwear <b>1</b> according to an exemplary embodiment can adjust its size by a sufficient length.</p>
<p id="p-0042" num="0040">In headwear <b>1</b> according to an exemplary embodiment, at a predetermined temperature or higher, shape-changing component <b>31</b> extends in the circumferential direction at a rate according to the tensile force applied to shape-changing component <b>31</b> in the circumferential direction.</p>
