<p id="p-0002" num="0001">The present disclosure relates to capsules, heat-not-burn (HNB) aerosol-generating devices, and methods of generating an aerosol without involving a substantial pyrolysis of the aerosol-forming substrate.</p>
<heading id="h-0003" level="1">Description of Related Art</heading>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">Some electronic devices are configured to heat a plant material to a temperature that is sufficient to release constituents of the plant material while keeping the temperature below its ignition temperature so as to avoid a self-sustaining burning or a self-sustaining combustion of the plant material (i.e., in contrast to where a plant material is lit, such as lit-end cigarettes). Such devices may be characterized as generating an aerosol of constituents released by heating, and may be referred to as heat-not-burn aerosol-generating devices, or heat-not-burn devices.</p>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">It is understood that heating of a plant material below its ignition temperature may, in some circumstances, produce incidental and insubstantial levels of oxidized or other thermal decomposition byproducts. However, in some embodiments, the heating in aerosol-generating devices is below the pyrolysis temperature of the plant material so as to produce an aerosol having no or insubstantial levels of thermal decomposition byproducts of the plant material. Thus, in an example embodiment, pyrolysis of the plant material does not occur during the heating and resulting production of aerosol. In other instances, there may be incidental pyrolysis, with production of oxidized or other thermal decomposition byproducts at levels that are insignificant relative to the primary constituents released by heating of the plant materials.</p>
<heading id="h-0004" level="1">SUMMARY</heading>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">At least one embodiment relates to a capsule for a heat-not-burn (HNB) aerosol-generating device.

<p id="p-0046" num="0045">Some detailed example embodiments are disclosed herein. However, specific structural and functional details disclosed herein are merely representative for purposes of describing example embodiments. Example embodiments may, however, be embodied in many alternate forms and should not be construed as limited to only the example embodiments set forth herein.</p>
<p id="p-0047" num="0046">Accordingly, while example embodiments are capable of various modifications and alternative forms, example embodiments thereof are shown by way of example in the drawings and will herein be described in detail. It should be understood, however, that there is no intent to limit example embodiments to the particular forms disclosed, but to the contrary, example embodiments are to cover all modifications, equivalents, and alternatives thereof. Like numbers refer to like elements throughout the description of the figures.</p>
<p id="p-0048" num="0047">It should be understood that when an element or layer is referred to as being &#x201c;on,&#x201d; &#x201c;connected to,&#x201d; &#x201c;coupled to,&#x201d; &#x201c;attached to,&#x201d; &#x201c;adjacent to,&#x201d; or &#x201c;covering&#x201d; another element or layer, it may be directly on, connected to, coupled to, attached to, adjacent to or covering the other element or layer or intervening elements or layers may be present. In contrast, when an element is referred to as being &#x201c;directly on,&#x201d; &#x201c;directly connected to,&#x201d; or &#x201c;directly coupled to&#x201d; another element or layer, there are no intervening elements or layers present. Like numbers refer to like elements throughout the specification. As used herein, the term &#x201c;and/or&#x201d; includes any and all combinations or sub-combinations of one or more of the associated listed items.</p>
<p id="p-0049" num="0048">It should be understood that, although the terms first, second, third, etc. may be used herein to describe various elements, regions, layers and/or sections, these elements, regions, layers, and/or sections should not be limited by these terms. These terms are only used to distinguish one element, region, layer, or section from another region, layer, or section. Thus, a first element, region, layer, or section discussed below could be termed a second element, region, layer, or section without departing from the teachings of example embodiments.</p>
<p id="p-0050" num="0049">Spatially relative terms (e.g., &#x201c;beneath,&#x201d; &#x201c;below,&#x201d; &#x201c;lower,&#x201d; &#x201c;above,&#x201d; &#x201c;upper,&#x201d; and the like) may be used herein for ease of description to describe one element or feature's relationship to another element(s) or feature(s) as illustrated in the figures. It should be understood that the spatially relative terms are intended to encompass different orientations of the device in use or operation in addition to the orientation depicted in the figures. For example, if the device in the figures is turned over, elements described as &#x201c;below&#x201d; or &#x201c;beneath&#x201d; other elements or features would then be oriented &#x201c;above&#x201d; the other elements or features. Thus, the term &#x201c;below&#x201d; may encompass both an orientation of above and below. The device may be otherwise oriented (rotated 90 degrees or at other orientations) and the spatially relative descriptors used herein interpreted accordingly.</p>
<p id="p-0051" num="0050">The terminology used herein is for the purpose of describing various example embodiments only and is not intended to be limiting of example embodiments.

<p id="p-0055" num="0054"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>1</b>A-<b>1</b>G</figref> illustrate an aerosol-generating device according to at least one example embodiment.</p>
<p id="p-0056" num="0055"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b>A</figref> is a front perspective view of an aerosol-generating device according to an example embodiment. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b>B</figref> is a rear perspective view of the aerosol-generating device of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b>A</figref>. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b>C</figref> is an upstream perspective view of the aerosol-generating device of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b>A</figref>. Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>1</b>A-C</figref>, an aerosol-generating device <b>10</b> is configured to receive and heat an aerosol-forming substrate to produce an aerosol. The aerosol-generating device <b>10</b> includes, inter alia, a front housing <b>1202</b>, a heating module <b>1203</b>, a rear housing <b>1204</b>, and a bottom housing <b>1206</b> coupled to a frame <b>1208</b> (e.g., chassis). A door <b>1210</b> is also pivotally connected/attached to the front housing <b>1202</b>. For instance, the door <b>1210</b> is configured to move or swing about a hinge <b>1212</b> and configured to reversibly engage/disengage with the front housing <b>1202</b> via a latch <b>1214</b> in order to transition between an open position and a closed position. The aerosol-forming substrate, which may be contained within a capsule <b>100</b> (e.g., <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b>A</figref>), may be loaded into the aerosol-generating device <b>10</b> via the heating module <b>1203</b>. During an operation of the aerosol-generating device <b>10</b>, the aerosol produced may be drawn from the aerosol-generating device <b>10</b> via the aerosol outlet <b>1102</b> defined by the mouthpiece <b>1104</b> of the mouthpiece <b>1100</b> (e.g., <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b>G</figref>).</p>
<p id="p-0057" num="0056">As illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b>B</figref>, the aerosol-generating device <b>10</b> includes a first button <b>1218</b> and a second button <b>1220</b>. The first button <b>1218</b> may be a pre-heat button, and the second button <b>1220</b> may be a power button (or vice versa). Additionally, one or both of the first button <b>1218</b> and the second button <b>1220</b> may include a light-emitting diode (LED) configured to emit a visible light when the first button <b>1218</b> and/or the second button <b>1220</b> is pressed. Where both of the first button <b>1218</b> and the second button <b>1220</b> includes an LED, the lights emitted may be of the same color or of different colors. The lights may also be of the same intensity or of different intensities. Furthermore, the lights may be configured as continuous lights or intermittent lights. For instance, the light in connection with the power button (e.g., second button <b>1220</b>) may blink/flash to indicate that the power supply (e.g., battery) is low and in need charging. While the aerosol-generating device <b>10</b> is shown as having two buttons, it should be understood that more (e.g., three) or less buttons may be provided depending on the desired interface and functionalities.</p>
<p id="p-0058" num="0057">The aerosol-generating device <b>10</b> may have a cuboid-like shape which includes a front face, a rear face opposite the front face, a first side face between the front face and the rear face, a second side face opposite the first side face, a downstream end face, and an upstream end face opposite the downstream end face. As used herein, &#x201c;upstream&#x201d; (and, conversely, &#x201c;downstream&#x201d;) is in relation to a flow of the aerosol, and &#x201c;proximal&#x201d; (and, conversely, &#x201c;distal&#x201d;) is in relation to an adult operator of the aerosol-generating device <b>10</b> during aerosol generation. Although the aerosol-generating device <b>10</b> is illustrated as having a cuboid-like shape (e.g., rounded rectangular cuboid) with a polygonal cross-section, it should be understood that example embodiments are not limited thereto. For instance, in some embodiments, the aerosol-generating device <b>10</b> may have a cylinder-like shape with a circular cross-section (e.g., for a circular cylinder) or an elliptical cross-section (e.g., for an elliptic cylinder).</p>
<p id="p-0059" num="0058">As illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b>C</figref>, the aerosol-generating device <b>10</b> includes an inlet insert <b>1222</b> configured to permit ambient air to enter the device body <b>1200</b> (e.g., <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref>). In an example embodiment, the inlet insert <b>1222</b> defines an orifice as an air inlet which is in fluidic communication with the aerosol outlet <b>1102</b>. As a result, when a draw (e.g., a puff) or negative pressure is applied to the aerosol outlet <b>1102</b>, ambient air will be pulled into the device body <b>1200</b> via the orifice in the inlet insert <b>1222</b>. The size (e.g., diameter) of the orifice in the inlet insert <b>1222</b> made be adjusted, while also taking in account other variables (e.g., capsule <b>100</b>) in the flow path, to provide the desired overall resistance-to-draw (RTD). In other embodiments, the inlet insert <b>1222</b> may be omitted altogether such that the air inlet is defined by the bottom housing <b>1206</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0060" num="0059">The aerosol-generating device <b>10</b> may additionally include a jack <b>1224</b> and a port <b>1226</b>. In an example embodiment, the jack <b>1224</b> permits the downloading of operational information for research and development (R&#x26;D) purposes (e.g., via an RS<b>232</b> cable). The port <b>1226</b> is configured to receive an electric current (e.g., via a USB/mini-USB cable) from an external power supply so as to charge an internal power supply within the aerosol-generating device <b>10</b>. In addition, the port <b>1226</b> may also be configured to send data to and/or receive data (e.g., via a USB/mini-USB cable) from another aerosol-generating device or other electronic device (e.g., phone, tablet, computer). Furthermore, the aerosol-generating device <b>10</b> may be configured for wireless communication with another electronic device, such as a phone, via an application software (app) installed on that electronic device. In such an instance, an adult operator may control or otherwise interface with the aerosol-generating device <b>10</b> (e.g., locate the aerosol-generating device, check usage information, change operating parameters) through the app.</p>
<p id="p-0061" num="0060"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b>D</figref> is a front perspective view of the aerosol-generating device of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>1</b>A-<b>1</b>C</figref> and <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b>E</figref> illustrates a mouthpiece <b>1104</b> and a capsule <b>100</b> are separated from the device body. Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>1</b>D-<b>1</b>E</figref>, the aerosol-generating device <b>10</b> includes a device body <b>1200</b> configured to receive a capsule <b>100</b> and a mouthpiece <b>1104</b>. In an example embodiment, the device body <b>1200</b> defines a receptacle <b>1228</b> configured to receive the heating module <b>1203</b>. The receptacle <b>1228</b> may be in a form of a cylindrical socket with outwardly-extending, diametrically-opposed side slots to accommodate the electrical end sections/contacts of the heating module <b>1203</b>. However, it should be understood that the receptacle <b>1228</b> may be in other forms based on the shape/configuration of the heating module <b>1203</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0062" num="0061">As noted supra, the device body <b>1200</b> includes a door <b>1210</b> configured to open to permit an insertion of the capsule <b>100</b> and the mouthpiece <b>1104</b> and configured to close to retain the capsule <b>100</b>. The mouthpiece <b>1104</b> includes a mouth end (e.g., at the outlet <b>1102</b>) and an opposing capsule end (e.g., to interface with the capsule <b>100</b> and the heating module <b>1203</b>). In an example embodiment, the capsule end is configured to prevent a disengagement of the mouthpiece <b>1104</b> from the capsule <b>100</b> and the heating module <b>1203</b> when the door <b>1210</b> of the device body <b>1200</b> is closed. When received/secured within the device body <b>1200</b> and ready for aerosol generation, the capsule <b>100</b> may be in the heating module <b>1203</b> and hidden from view while the mouthpiece <b>1104</b> defining the aerosol outlet <b>1102</b> of the mouthpiece <b>1100</b> is visible. As illustrated in the figures, the mouthpiece <b>1104</b> may be closer to the front face of the device body <b>1200</b> than the rear face.</p>
<p id="p-0063" num="0062">In some instances, the device body <b>1200</b> of the aerosol-generating device <b>10</b> may optionally include a mouthpiece sensor and/or a door sensor. The mouthpiece sensor may be disposed on a rim of the receptacle <b>1228</b> (e.g., adjacent to the front face of the device body <b>1200</b>). The door sensor may be disposed on a portion of the front housing <b>1202</b> adjacent to the hinge <b>1212</b> and within the swing path of the door <b>1210</b>. In an example embodiment, the mouthpiece sensor and the door sensor are spring-loaded (e.g., retractable) projections configured as safety switches. For instance, the mouthpiece sensor may be retracted/depressed (e.g., activated) when the mouthpiece <b>1104</b> is fully engaged with the capsule <b>100</b> loaded within the heating module <b>1203</b>. Additionally, the door sensor may be retracted/depressed (e.g., activated) when the door <b>1210</b> is fully closed. In such instances, the control circuitry of the device body <b>1200</b> may permit an electric current to be supplied to the capsule <b>100</b> to heat the aerosol-forming substrate therein (e.g., pre-heat permitted when the first button <b>1218</b> is pressed). Conversely, the control circuitry (e.g., a controller <b>2105</b>) of the device body <b>1200</b> may prevent or cease the supply of electric current when the mouthpiece sensor and/or the door sensor is not activated or deactivated (e.g., released). Thus, the heating of the aerosol-forming substrate will not be initiated if the mouthpiece <b>1104</b> is not fully inserted and/or if the door <b>1210</b> is not fully closed. Similarly, the supply of electric current to the capsule <b>100</b> will be disrupted/halted if the door <b>1210</b> is opened during the heating of the aerosol-forming substrate.</p>
<p id="p-0064" num="0063">The capsule <b>100</b>, which will be discussed herein in more detail (e.g., shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>2</b>A-<b>2</b>C</figref>), generally includes a housing defining inlet openings, outlet openings, an inner wall, an outer wall and a chamber defined by the inlet openings, the outlet openings, the inner wall and the outer wall. An aerosol-forming substrate is disposed within the chamber of the housing. Additionally, a heater may extend into a space defined by the inner wall and exterior from the housing.</p>
<p id="p-0065" num="0064">The control circuitry may instruct a power supply to supply an electric current to the heater. The supply of current from the power supply may be in response to a manual operation (e.g., button-activation) or an automatic operation (e.g., draw/puff-activation). As a result of the current, the capsule <b>100</b> may be heated to generate an aerosol. In addition, the change in resistance of the heater may be used to monitor and control the aerosolization temperature. The aerosol generated may be drawn from the aerosol-generating device <b>10</b> via the mouthpiece <b>1104</b>. In addition, the control circuitry (e.g., a controller <b>2105</b>) may supply an electric current from the power supply to the heater to maintain a temperature of the capsule <b>100</b> between draws.</p>
<p id="p-0066" num="0065"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b>F</figref> is a cross-sectional view of the aerosol-generating device <b>10</b> along the line <b>1</b>F-<b>1</b>F&#x2032; in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b>D</figref>. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b>G</figref> is a cross-sectional view of the aerosol-generating device <b>10</b> along the line <b>1</b>G-<b>1</b>G&#x2032; in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b>D</figref>. Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>1</b>F-<b>1</b>G</figref>, the frame <b>1208</b> (e.g., metal chassis) serves as a foundation for the internal components of the aerosol-generating device <b>10</b>, which may be attached either directly or indirectly thereto. With regard to structures/components shown in the figures and already discussed above, it should be understood that such relevant teachings are also applicable to this section and may not have been repeated in the interest of brevity. In an example embodiment, the bottom housing <b>1206</b> is secured to the upstream end of the frame <b>1208</b>. Between the receptacle <b>1228</b> and the bottom housing <b>1206</b> is an inlet channel <b>1230</b> configured to direct an incoming flow of ambient air to the capsule <b>100</b> in the receptacle <b>1228</b> along a path A. The inlet insert <b>1222</b>, through which the incoming air may flow into the aerosol-generating device <b>10</b>, may be disposed in the distal end of the inlet channel <b>1230</b>. Furthermore, the receptacle <b>1228</b> and/or the inlet channel <b>1230</b> and may include a flow sensor <b>1231</b> (e.g., integrated flow sensor to detect at least one of magnitude of air flow, a direction of air flow, a pressure change, or a magnitude of pressure).</p>
<p id="p-0067" num="0066">A power supply <b>1234</b> therein (e.g., <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b>E</figref>) may be mounted onto the rear side of the frame <b>1208</b>. To establish an electrical connection with a heater <b>1300</b> in the heating module <b>1203</b> (e.g., which is in the receptacle <b>1228</b>), an electric connection may be provided to facilitate the supply of an electric current. For instance, the electric connection <b>1236</b><i>a </i>may establish the requisite electrical connection between the power supply <b>1234</b> and the heater <b>1300</b> via two electrodes of the heater <b>1300</b> and control circuitry (e.g., the controller <b>2105</b>) on a first printed circuit board (PCB) <b>1238</b>. The electric connection <b>1236</b><i>a </i>may be a pair of wires connected to the two electrodes. However, example embodiments are not limited thereto.</p>
<p id="p-0068" num="0067">The aerosol-generating device <b>10</b> may also include a plurality of printed circuit boards (PCBs) configured to facilitate its operation. In an example embodiment, the first printed circuit board <b>1238</b> (e.g., bridge PCB for power and I2C) and a second printed circuit board <b>1240</b> (e.g., human machine interface (HMI) PCB) are connected to the frame <b>1208</b>. In another instance, a third printed circuit board <b>1242</b> (e.g., serial port PCB) is secured to the front of the frame <b>1208</b> and situated behind the inlet channel <b>1230</b>. However, it should be understood that the example embodiments herein regarding the printed circuit boards should not be interpreted as limiting since the size, shapes, and locations thereof may vary depending on the desired features of the aerosol-generating device <b>10</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0069" num="0068">The PCB <b>1238</b> provides power from the power supply <b>1234</b> to the electric connection <b>1236</b><i>a </i>upon conditions for a draw being reached (e.g., power of the device is on and a predetermined pressure change is reached).</p>
<p id="p-0070" num="0069">The mouthpiece <b>1104</b> defines an aerosol outlet <b>1102</b> in the form of a single outlet or a plurality of smaller outlets (e.g., two to six outlets). In one instance, the plurality of outlets may be in the form of four outlets. The outlets may be radially-arranged and/or outwardly-angled so as to release diverging streams of aerosol.</p>
<p id="p-0071" num="0070">In an example embodiment, at least one of a filter or a flavor medium may be optionally disposed within the mouthpiece <b>1104</b>. In such an instance, a filter and/or a flavor medium will be downstream from a chamber <b>1305</b> of the capsule <b>100</b> such that the aerosol generated therein passes through at least one of the filter or the flavor medium before exiting through the at least one aerosol outlet <b>1102</b>. The filter may reduce or prevent particles from the aerosol-forming substrate (e.g., from being inadvertently drawn from the capsule <b>100</b>). The filter may also help reduce the temperature of the aerosol in order to provide a desired mouth feel. The flavor medium (e.g., flavor beads) may release a flavorant when the aerosol passes therethrough so as to impart the aerosol with a desired flavor. The flavorant may be the same as described above in connection with the aerosol-forming substrate. Furthermore, the filter and/or the flavor medium may have a consolidated form or a loose form as described supra in connection with the aerosol-forming substrate.</p>
<p id="p-0072" num="0071">A first annular member <b>150</b> <i>a </i>(e.g., resilient O-ring) is upstream of the capsule <b>100</b> and prevents air from flowing through a holder <b>1307</b> for the heater <b>1300</b> and establishes an air seal between the heater <b>1300</b> and the capsule when the capsule <b>100</b> is fully inserted into the heating module <b>1203</b>. The aerosol-generating device <b>10</b> may also include a second annular member <b>150</b><i>b </i>(e.g., resilient O-ring) seated within the receptacle <b>1228</b>. As a result, most if not all of the air drawn into the heating module <b>1203</b> will pass through an annular portion of the capsule <b>100</b>. In an example embodiment, the first annular member <b>150</b> <i>a </i>and the second annular member <b>150</b><i>b </i>may be formed of clear silicone.</p>
<p id="p-0073" num="0072">The power supply <b>1234</b> may be a 900 mAh battery, although example embodiments are not limited thereto. In view of the sensor <b>1231</b> as well as the first button <b>1218</b> and the second button <b>1220</b>, the operation of the aerosol-generating device <b>10</b> may be an automatic operation (e.g., puff-activated) or a manual operation (e.g., button-activated). In at least one example embodiment, the sensor <b>1231</b> may be a microelectromechanical system (MEMS) flow or pressure sensor or another type of sensor configured to measure air flow such as a hot-wire anemometer.</p>
<p id="p-0074" num="0073">Upon activating the aerosol-generating device <b>10</b>, the capsule <b>100</b> within the device body <b>1200</b> may be heated to generate an aerosol. In an example embodiment, the activation of the aerosol-generating device <b>10</b> may be triggered by the detection of an air flow by the sensor <b>1231</b> and/or the generation of a signal associated with the pressing of the first button <b>1218</b> and/or the second button <b>1220</b>. With regard to the detection of an air flow, a draw or application of negative pressure on the aerosol outlet <b>1102</b> of the mouthpiece <b>1104</b> will pull ambient air into the device body <b>1200</b> via the inlet channel <b>1230</b>, wherein the air may initially pass through the inlet insert <b>1222</b>. Once inside the device body <b>1200</b>, the air travels through the inlet channel <b>1230</b> and is detected by the sensor <b>1231</b>. After the sensor <b>1231</b>, the air continues through the receptacle <b>1228</b> and enters the capsule <b>100</b> in areas around the heater <b>1300</b>. Specifically, the air will flow through the apertures of the capsule <b>100</b>. Moreover, the control circuitry (e.g., the controller <b>2105</b>) may supply an electric current from the power supply <b>1234</b> to the heater <b>1300</b> to maintain a temperature of the capsule <b>100</b> between draws.</p>
<p id="p-0075" num="0074">The detection of the air flow by the sensor <b>1231</b> may cause the control circuitry to supply an electric current to the heater <b>1300</b> via the electric connection <b>1236</b><i>a</i>. As a result, the temperature of the heater <b>1300</b> will increase which, in turn, will cause the temperature of the capsule <b>100</b> to increase through heat transfer and causes the temperature of the aerosol-forming substrate inside the chamber of the capsule <b>100</b> to increase such that volatiles are released by the aerosol-forming substrate to produce an aerosol. The aerosol produced will be entrained by the air flowing through the chamber. In particular, the aerosol produced in the chamber will exit the aerosol-generating device <b>10</b> from the aerosol outlet <b>1102</b> of the mouthpiece <b>1104</b>.</p>

<p id="p-0084" num="0083">A first surface <b>284</b><i>a </i>of the inner wall <b>284</b> defines the inner diameter and inner circumference of the first circular portion <b>282</b>.

In the example shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b>B</figref>, the inner wall <b>284</b> is normal to the first circular portion <b>282</b> and the second circular portion <b>286</b>.

<p id="p-0090" num="0089">The apertures <b>296</b> allow air to enter the capsule <b>200</b>. More specifically, air enters through the apertures <b>296</b>, flows into the inner space <b>226</b> and out of apertures <b>296</b> in the opposing end cap.</p>
<p id="p-0091" num="0090">The apertures <b>296</b> are sized such that the aerosol-forming substrate do not fall out of the apertures and may not be pulled out of the capsule.

A length in the cavity <b>270</b> between the two end caps <b>280</b> may be 10-15 mm (e.g., 12.1 mm). It should be understood that the length between the two end caps <b>280</b> may be increased or decreased to vary a volume of a material in the cavity <b>270</b>. Moreover, increasing the length between the two end caps <b>280</b> may increase the resistance to draw (RTD). In some example embodiments, a width of the cavity <b>270</b> (distance between the wall <b>255</b> and the wall <b>217</b>) may be 2 mm. An inner diameter of the wall <b>255</b> that defines the space <b>265</b> may be 3-4 mm (e.g., 3.2 mm).

<p id="p-0105" num="0104">In an example embodiment, the heater <b>300</b> is in thermal communication with the capsule <b>200</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0106" num="0105">In an example embodiment, the heater <b>300</b> heats an aerosol-forming substrate <b>320</b> in the capsule <b>200</b> in order to produce an aerosol <b>322</b>. In an example embodiment, at least a portion of the heater <b>300</b> contacts the capsule <b>200</b> such that heat generated by the heater <b>300</b> is transferred to the capsule <b>200</b>. The capsule <b>200</b> is made of a heat conducting material and heats the aerosol-forming substrate <b>320</b> using the heat generated by the heater <b>300</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0107" num="0106">In some example embodiments, the heater <b>300</b> warms the inner body <b>250</b> and the inner body <b>250</b> transfers the heat from the heater <b>300</b> to the aerosol-forming substrate <b>320</b>, but the heater <b>300</b> does not burn and/or combust the aerosol-forming substrate <b>320</b>. In some example embodiments, the heater <b>300</b> includes a sleeve to act as a shim and increase contact with the capsule <b>200</b>. Additionally or alternatively, the inner body <b>250</b> is designed to increase contact and thermal transfer between the heater <b>300</b> and the capsule <b>200</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0108" num="0107">The heater <b>300</b> may heat the aerosol-forming substrate <b>320</b> to a temperature of 125 degrees Celsius to 320 degrees Celsius and, more preferable, between 250-280 degrees Celsius. However, example embodiments are not limited thereto. For example, the heater <b>300</b> may be controlled to heat at a desired temperature based on a type of aerosol-forming substrate <b>320</b> in the capsule <b>200</b>, the density of the aerosol-forming substrate in the capsule <b>200</b>, additives in the aerosol-forming substrate, a sub-combination thereof or a combination thereof. Moreover, the heater <b>300</b> may be controlled using a proportional-integral-derivative controller to use multiple temperature setpoints to normalize aerosol generation.</p>
<p id="p-0109" num="0108">Air flows along path <b>330</b> and enters the capsule <b>200</b> through apertures <b>296</b><i>a</i>. The heater <b>300</b> is capable of heating the aerosol-forming substrate <b>320</b> to an extent that the flavoring, nicotine and/or ingredients in the aerosol-forming substrate <b>320</b> is at least partially extracted (e.g., aerosolized) to create the aerosol <b>322</b> that is extracted from aerosol-forming substrate <b>320</b>. The heater <b>300</b> heats the capsule <b>200</b> and the aerosol-forming substrate <b>320</b> to an extent that the aerosol-forming substrate <b>320</b> and the flavoring, nicotine and/or other materials of the aerosol-forming substrate <b>320</b> remain below a combustion temperature.</p>
<p id="p-0110" num="0109">Consequently, the air mixes with the aerosol-forming substrate <b>320</b> to form an aerosol <b>322</b> that exists the capsule <b>200</b> through apertures <b>296</b><i>b. </i></p>
<p id="p-0111" num="0110">As discussed herein, an aerosol-forming substrate is a material or combination of materials that may yield an aerosol. An aerosol relates to the matter generated or output by the devices disclosed, claimed, and equivalents thereof. The material may include a compound (e.g., nicotine, cannabinoid, cannabimimetic agent) that is released when the material is heated. In such an instance, an aerosol including the compound is produced when the material is heated. The heating may be below the ignition temperature so as to avoid a self-sustaining burning or a self-sustaining combustion of the material (i.e., in contrast to where a material is lit, such as lit-end cigarettes). It is understood that heating of a material below its ignition temperature may, in some circumstances, produce incidental and insubstantial levels of oxidized or other thermal decomposition byproducts. However, in some embodiments, the heating in aerosol-generating devices is below the pyrolysis temperature of the material so as to produce an aerosol having no or insubstantial levels of thermal decomposition byproducts of the material. Thus, in an example embodiment, pyrolysis of the material does not occur during the heating and resulting production of aerosol. In other instances, there may be incidental pyrolysis, with production of oxidized or other thermal decomposition byproducts at levels that are insignificant relative to the primary constituents released by heating of the material.</p>
<p id="p-0112" num="0111">The material(s) of the aerosol-forming substrate may include a fibrous material. For instance, the fibrous material may be a botanical material. The fibrous material is configured to release a compound when heated. The compound may be a naturally occurring constituent of the fibrous material. For instance, the fibrous material may be plant material such as tobacco, and the compound released may be nicotine. The term &#x201c;tobacco&#x201d; includes any tobacco plant material including tobacco leaf, tobacco plug, reconstituted tobacco, compressed tobacco, shaped tobacco, or powder tobacco, and combinations thereof from one or more species of tobacco plants, such as <i>Nicotiana rustica </i>and <i>Nicotiana tabacum. </i></p>
<p id="p-0113" num="0112">In some example embodiments, the tobacco material may include material from any member of the genus <i>Nicotiana</i>. In addition, the tobacco material may include a blend of two or more different tobacco varieties. Examples of suitable types of tobacco materials that may be used include, but are not limited to, flue-cured tobacco, Burley tobacco, Dark tobacco, Maryland tobacco, Oriental tobacco, rare tobacco, specialty tobacco, blends thereof, and the like. The tobacco material may be provided in any suitable form, including, but not limited to, tobacco lamina, processed tobacco materials, such as volume expanded or puffed tobacco, processed tobacco stems, such as cut-rolled or cut-puffed stems, reconstituted tobacco materials, blends thereof, and the like. In some example embodiments, the tobacco material is in the form of a substantially dry tobacco mass. Furthermore, in some instances, the tobacco material may be mixed and/or combined with at least one of propylene glycol, glycerin, sub-combinations thereof, or combinations thereof.</p>
<p id="p-0114" num="0113">The compound in the generated aerosol may also be a naturally occurring constituent of a medicinal plant that has a medically-accepted physiological effect (e.g., therapeutic effect, prophylactic effect). For instance, the medicinal plant may be a cannabis plant or a cannabimimetic plant (i.e., a plant with similar pharmacological effects to those of cannabis). For a cannabis plant, the compound may be a cannabinoid. Cannabinoids interact with receptors in the body to produce a wide range of effects. As a result, cannabinoids have been used for a variety of medicinal purposes (e.g., treatment of pain, nausea, epilepsy, psychiatric disorders). The fibrous material may include the leaf and/or flower material from one or more species of cannabis plants such as <i>Cannabis sativa, Cannabis indica</i>, and <i>Cannabis ruderalis</i>. In some instances, the fibrous material is a mixture of 60-80% (e.g., 70%) <i>Cannabis sativa </i>and 20-40% (e.g., 30%) <i>Cannabis indica</i>. For a cannabimimetic plant, the compound may be a cannabimimetic agent. Cannabimimetic agents interact with receptors in the body to produce similar pharmacological effects as cannabinoids.</p>
<p id="p-0115" num="0114">Examples of cannabinoids include tetrahydrocannabinolic acid (THCA), tetrahydrocannabinol (THC), cannabidiolic acid (CBDA), cannabidiol (CBD), cannabinol (CBN), cannabicyclol (CBL), cannabichromene (CBC), and cannabigerol (CBG). Tetrahydrocannabinolic acid (THCA) is a precursor of tetrahydrocannabinol (THC), while cannabidiolic acid (CBDA) is precursor of cannabidiol (CBD). Tetrahydrocannabinolic acid (THCA) and cannabidiolic acid (CBDA) may be converted to tetrahydrocannabinol (THC) and cannabidiol (CBD), respectively, via heating. In an example embodiment, heat from a heater (e.g., of the heating assembly <b>340</b> shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>8</b></figref>) may cause decarboxylation so as to convert the tetrahydrocannabinolic acid (THCA) to tetrahydrocannabinol (THC), and/or to convert the cannabidiolic acid (CBDA) to cannabidiol (CBD).</p>
<p id="p-0116" num="0115">In instances where both tetrahydrocannabinolic acid (THCA) and tetrahydrocannabinol (THC) are present, the decarboxylation and resulting conversion will cause a decrease in tetrahydrocannabinolic acid (THCA) and an increase in tetrahydrocannabinol (THC). At least 50% (e.g., at least 87%) of the tetrahydrocannabinolic acid (THCA) may be converted to tetrahydrocannabinol (THC) during the heating. Similarly, in instances where both cannabidiolic acid (CBDA) and cannabidiol (CBD) are present, the decarboxylation and resulting conversion will cause a decrease in cannabidiolic acid (CBDA) and an increase in cannabidiol (CBD). At least 50% (e.g., at least 87%) of the cannabidiolic acid (CBDA) may be converted to cannabidiol (CBD) during the heating.</p>
<p id="p-0117" num="0116">Furthermore, the compound which is released may be or may additionally include a non-naturally occurring additive that is subsequently introduced into the fibrous material. In one instance, the fibrous material may include at least one of cotton, polyethylene, polyester, rayon, combinations thereof, or the like (e.g., in a form of a gauze). In another instance, the fibrous material may be a cellulose material (e.g., non-tobacco and/or non-cannabis material). In either instance, the compound introduced may include nicotine, cannabinoids, cannabimimetic agents, and/or flavorants. The flavorants may be from natural sources, such as plant extracts (e.g., tobacco extract, cannabis extract, cannabimimetic extract), and/or artificial sources. In yet another instance, when the fibrous material includes tobacco and/or cannabis, the compound may be or may additionally include one or more flavorants (e.g., menthol, mint, vanilla). Thus, the compound within the aerosol-forming substrate may include naturally occurring constituents and/or non-naturally occurring additives. In this regard, it should be understood that existing levels of the naturally occurring constituents of the aerosol-forming substrate may be increased through supplementation. For example, the existing levels of nicotine in a quantity of tobacco may be increased through supplementation with an extract containing nicotine. Similarly, the existing levels of one or more cannabinoids in a quantity of cannabis may be increased through supplementation with an extract containing such cannabinoids. Likewise, the existing levels of one or more cannabimimetic agents in a quantity of cannabimimetic material may be increased through supplementation with an extract containing such cannabimimetic agents.</p>

<p id="p-0143" num="0142">The inner body <b>250</b><i>b </i>is the same as the inner body <b>250</b> except the inner body <b>250</b><i>b </i>includes a plurality of ribs <b>515</b> that are curved, instead of rectangular. More specifically, each rib <b>515</b> includes a first straight side <b>520</b> and a second straight side <b>522</b>. A rounded side <b>524</b> connects the first straight side <b>520</b> and the second straight side <b>522</b> at a first end and a rounded side <b>526</b> connects the first straight side <b>520</b> and the second straight side <b>522</b> at a second end. The first straight side <b>520</b>, the second straight side <b>522</b>, the rounded side <b>524</b> and the rounded side <b>526</b> define edges of a concave surface <b>530</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0144" num="0143">In the example embodiments shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>4</b>A-<b>4</b>B and <b>5</b>A-<b>5</b>B</figref>, the ribs <b>415</b> and <b>515</b> are formed after the cylindrical body of the inner body is formed. For example, a sheet of aluminum is rolled into a cylindrical shape and the ribs are then formed by pressing the tube. In embodiments where the sheet is longer than the inner body, the sheet is cut after the ribs are formed, thereby generating a plurality of inner bodies.</p>
<p id="p-0145" num="0144">The thickness of the ribs and the number of ribs may be determined based on empirical data or using Finite Element Analysis (FEA). The thickness of the ribs is also based on a tolerance of the width of the heater and the ability to maintain a flexibility while maintaining the ability to provide desired thermal contact with the heater.</p>
<p id="p-0146" num="0145"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>6</b>A-<b>6</b>B</figref> illustrate an inner body according to at least one example embodiment.</p>
<p id="p-0147" num="0146"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>6</b>A</figref> illustrates a top view of an inner body <b>600</b>. The dimensions and material of the inner body <b>600</b> may be the same as the inner body <b>250</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0148" num="0147">The inner body <b>600</b> is the same as the inner body <b>250</b> except the inner body <b>600</b> includes a rolled sheet that forms a plurality of layers <b>610</b> <i>a</i>, <b>610</b><i>b </i>and <b>610</b><i>c </i>in a coiled fashion to create a spring biased in the position shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>6</b>A</figref>. More specifically, the sheet is rolled from a first tongue <b>620</b> (inner most part of the inner body <b>600</b>) to a second tongue <b>625</b> (outer most part of the inner body <b>600</b>). The layers <b>610</b> <i>a</i>, <b>610</b><i>b </i>and <b>610</b><i>c </i>are overlapping.</p>
<p id="p-0149" num="0148">The coiling creates overlaps, and so wall thickness is not constant. The inner diameter of the coiled body is set to be less than the outer diameter of the heater, ensuring that the coiled body flexes outwards in order to be placed over the heater. In an example embodiment, the inner diameter of the coiled body may therefore be set to be 2.9 mm for use with a heater that has an outer diameter of 3.2 mm (i.e. ensuring contact under all manufacturing tolerances).</p>
<p id="p-0150" num="0149">The outer diameter inner body <b>600</b> is based on the thickness of the sheet (e.g., 50 &#x3bc;m, 100 &#x3bc;m or 150 &#x3bc;m and the number of wraps, e.g., 2 or 3). The number of wraps is a way of controlling the spring force and strength. In an example embodiment, for a 100 &#x3bc;m sheet and 2 full wraps (i.e., 2 or 3 layers of thickness) the outer diameter of the coiled body may be 3.1 to 3.2 mm (i.e., 2.9+2*0.1 to 2.9+3*0.1).</p>
<p id="p-0151" num="0150">The internal diameter of the inner body <b>600</b> is smaller than the diameter of the heater <b>300</b>. Thus, when the heater <b>300</b> is inserted though the inner body <b>600</b> or the inner body <b>600</b> is placed over the heater <b>300</b>, the rolled sheet expands/partially unwraps causing the inner diameter of the inner body <b>600</b> to expand to a diameter larger than the diameter of the heater <b>300</b>. Due to the coiling and spring bias of the inner body, the thermal conductivity between the inner body <b>600</b> on the heater <b>300</b> is increased.</p>
<p id="p-0152" num="0151">Due to the coiling and spring bias of the inner body <b>600</b>, the proportion of the inner body in direct thermal contact with the heater <b>300</b> is increased when the inner body <b>600</b> is inserted on the heater <b>300</b>, and therefore thermal conductivity between the inner body <b>600</b> and the heater is improved.</p>
<p id="p-0153" num="0152">While the number of layers is three, it should be understood that the number of layers may be higher or lower and the thickness of the layers maybe higher or lower.</p>
<p id="p-0154" num="0153">To make the inner body <b>600</b>, a central mandrel may be used in a rolling operation to provide the desired curvature of the first tongue <b>620</b> of the sheet.</p>
