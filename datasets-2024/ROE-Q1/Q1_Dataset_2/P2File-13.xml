<heading id="h-0001" level="1">CROSS-REFERENCE TO RELATED APPLICATIONS</heading>
<p id="p-0002" num="0001">This application claims benefit to U.S. Non-Provisional application Ser. No. 17/019,199, filed on Sep. 12, 2020 and titled, Shaving-Mirror Apparatus; the contents of which are incorporated herein by this reference as though set forth in their entirety, and to which priority and benefit are claimed.</p>
<heading id="h-0002" level="1">FIELD OF USE</heading>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">The present disclosure relates generally to shaving mirrors. More specifically, the disclosure relates to a shaving-mirror apparatus that is attachable to and readily removable from both the bottom of a shaving cream/gel-can container and the top of a shaving-gel squeeze-bottle container.</p>
<heading id="h-0003" level="1">BACKGROUND</heading>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">The practice of shaving facial hair with shaving cream/gel and a razor is an almost daily occurrence for many individuals. Effective shaving requires a mirror. Generally, most individuals shave in front of a mirror above the bathroom sink&#x2014;a time-consuming and somewhat cumbersome task because it requires individuals to rinse their face with water prior to shaving, continually rinse the razor in the sink throughout the shaving process, rinse/clean their face and razor after finishing, and then clean the area free of facial hair, water, and used shaving cream afterwards. Alternatively, shower mirrors currently in the market enable one to shave while in the shower, eliminating certain inefficiencies and the cumbersome nature of traditional shaving.</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">However, shower mirrors are awkward to use, unappealing, take up precious real estate in small showers, and are inconvenient to use. For example, existing support apparatuses of shower mirrors, such as suction cups or wire frames, are often in the way, poor quality at best, and ineffective at worst. They fail to attach to walls and rarely have universal application due to the wall material varying from bathroom to bathroom. Some are not very effective when the anti-fog treatment wears off and may pose safety risks if dropped. Many are made from plastic and are not durable or reliable. And none are conducive to being portable such that they're used both in and out of one's home. As a result, any benefits gained from the use of existing shower mirrors are outweighed by overall inconvenience.</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">Thus, what is needed is a new and improved shaving mirror that provides the benefits of a shower mirror without any of the existing common drawbacks or disadvantages. Ideally, such a shaving mirror is durable, portable for use in and out of one's residence, convenient to use in the shower, compatible with both cans and squeeze bottles, reusable, requires no additional space for placement, and comprises a fogless, safe, high-resolution mirror.</p>
<heading id="h-0004" level="1">SUMMARY</heading>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">The following presents a simplified overview of the example embodiments in order to provide a basic understanding of some embodiments of the example embodiments. This overview is not an extensive overview of the example embodiments. It is intended to neither identify key or critical elements of the example embodiments nor delineate the scope of the appended claims. Its sole purpose is to present some concepts of the example embodiments in a simplified form as a prelude to the more detailed description that is presented herein below. It is to be understood that both the following general description and the following detailed description are exemplary and explanatory only and are not restrictive.</p>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">In accordance with the embodiments disclosed herein, the present disclosure is directed to a shaving-mirror apparatus that is attachable to and readily removable from both (i) the bottom of a shaving cream/gel container via a slip-fit function and (ii) the top of a shaving-gel squeeze bottle via a slide-fit function, and a method of manufacturing the shaving-mirror apparatus. The shaving-mirror apparatus comprises a receptacle, wherein the receptacle comprises a bottom and an open top, wherein the bottom of the receptacle comprises a mirror. The shaving-mirror apparatus may further comprise a horizontal slit between the bottom and the open top of the receptacle.</p>
<p id="p-0009" num="0008">In some embodiments, the mirror may comprise one of the following: a flat mirror, a concave mirror, or a convex mirror. And the mirror may comprise one or both of the following attributes: anti-fog and water repellant. Shapes of the mirror may be one of the following: circle, square, or rectangle. Still, in some embodiments, the shaving-mirror apparatus may further comprise a 90-degree ridge that extends along the bottom inside circumference of the open top of the receptacle, directly above the mirror. Or it may comprise a pocket extending along the bottom inside circumference of the open top of the receptacle for the purpose of inserting the bottom ridge of a shaving-can container. The receptacle of the shaving-mirror apparatus may be made from a variety of materials, such as polyurethane, silicone, or any type of polyethylene.</p>
<p id="p-0010" num="0009">The manufacturing method comprises attaching a mirror to a receptacle, wherein the receptacle comprises an open top. The method may further comprise incorporating a horizontal slit into the receptable in between the bottom and the open top.</p>
<p id="p-0011" num="0010">Still other advantages, embodiments, and features of the subject disclosure will become readily apparent to those of ordinary skill in the art from the following description wherein there is shown and described a preferred embodiment of the present disclosure, simply by way of illustration of one of the best modes best suited to carry out the subject disclosure. As it will be realized, the present disclosure is capable of other different embodiments and its several details are capable of modifications in various obvious embodiments all without departing from, or limiting, the scope herein. Accordingly, the drawings and descriptions will be regarded as illustrative in nature and not as restrictive.</p>

<p id="p-0036" num="0035">In one embodiment, the apparatus comprises a wall <b>120</b>, wherein the wall <b>120</b> comprises the slit <b>115</b>. The wall <b>120</b> of the apparatus may further comprise a tapered edge at the top or it may comprise a square edge at the top. The shape of the apparatus is such that when it is placed onto the bottom of the container <b>105</b>, the inside of the wall <b>120</b> completely encompasses the sides of the container <b>105</b> and the bottom of the container <b>105</b> rests upon the bottom inside of the apparatus <b>100</b>. The apparatus <b>100</b> fits snuggly onto the container <b>105</b>, wherein the apparatus <b>100</b> can be removed by an individual physically removing it from off the bottom of the container <b>105</b> in a slip-fit manner. And when placed on the bottom of the container <b>105</b>, the apparatus <b>100</b> may provide additional support to the container <b>105</b>, such that it can stand upright. Embodiments of the apparatus comprise various dimensions so they fit onto common container such as travel-size containers, wide-diameter containers, and slim-diameter containers.</p>
<p id="p-0037" num="0036">The apparatus may be comprised of any material that enables the apparatus to retain its shape while being sufficiently flexible to fit onto the bottom of a container <b>105</b> or the top of a squeeze-bottle container. Examples of material include but are not limited to polyurethane, silicone, and types of polyethylene. The material of the apparatus can provide the additional benefit of preventing rust rings that form from an exposed wet container, and also reducing sliding of the container across a flat surface.</p>
<p id="p-0038" num="0037"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref> generally illustrates an embodiment of a shaving-mirror apparatus on the bottom of a shaving-can container.
