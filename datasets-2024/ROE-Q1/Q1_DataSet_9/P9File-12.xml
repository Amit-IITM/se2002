<heading id="h-0003" level="1">BACKGROUND</heading>
<heading id="h-0004" level="1">Field</heading>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">This disclosure relates to billfold wallets, and more particularly to low-profile wallets for credit cards.</p>
<heading id="h-0005" level="1">Description of the Related Art</heading>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">Who among us would not prefer a wallet minimally-sized to just the stack of credit cards carried in the typical bi- or tri-fold leather wallet? Such a minimalist wallet could be easily slipped into a shirt pocket, or present a slim profile in a pants pocket or purse.</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">Even with money clipped to it, the bulk of such a wallet would be less than that of the fold-over-envelope-type-wallet traditionally used to carry cards, money and identification. Such a traditional wallet, with its internal sleeves, compartments, and windows, not to mention contents, can bulge uncomfortably or telltale-like from clothing, or inconveniently in a handbag, while giving little protection from moisture, bending or electronic snooping.</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">In the lifestyle of today, purchases are made more and more with credit or debit cards or through electronic wallets, such as Apple Pay&#x2122; or Google Wallet&#x2122;. Carrying cash, except for an emergency bill or two, has increasingly become both unnecessary and inconvenient in consideration of the nuisance in making change and risk of loss through theft or carelessness. The traditional wallet, initially designed to carry cash in bills, and sometimes coins and checks also, is correspondingly evolving into obsolescence in view of the convenience and record-keeping benefit of credit/debit cards. The bare essentials today are a charge card of some type and an item of identification, both, serendipitously, of generally the same size.</p>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">Money clips are common in the art and some money clips also made accommodation for credit cards. The clip, typically of hairpin-like configuration, has protrusion which can snag in a pocket of clothing or purse. Other known devices sandwich cards and/or money between bookend plates bound with elastic strapping. The strapping allows for an expandable interior volume while providing compression to grip the contents. The profile of the plates is generally larger than that of the contents, the out-sizing necessary to provide structure for either, guiding the strapping or for fixtures to terminate the strapping. In most cases, the running length of the strapping is limited by the distance between fixture locations on the plates, which limits the expansion capability and, therefore, the capacity for contents. In other cases, it becomes difficult to view the stored contents without moving them all. In other cases, selectively withdrawing of just one of the contents, particularly with a presentation of the shorter edge, is frustrated by the compaction applied. In other cases, replacement of the straps when worn or stretched out is discouraged by assembly design. In other cases, the plates are of insufficient rigidity to protect the contents from bending.</p>
<p id="p-0009" num="0008">The unfulfilled need is for a compact wallet which would be minimally dimensioned to the prototypical credit card profile. Such a compact wallet would be void of any potentially snagging structural appendages while optimizing volume expansion and view-ability of contents.</p>
<heading id="h-0006" level="1">SUMMARY</heading>
<p id="p-0010" num="0009">The present invention utilizes bookend plates resiliently bound with an encircling elastic band to contain one or more credit card-sized objects in a wallet configuration. A novel feature maximizes the expansion of interior volume by allowing the strap to expand along a maximum length afforded by a longitudinal dimension of the wallet while avoiding anchor points which would effectively shorten the length. Another novel feature achieves minimal sizing of the plates by channeling the strap with interior means rather than by means of profile extensions. Yet another novel feature achieves easy access to, and viewing of, the contents through a cut-away feature which allows the contents to be partially pushed up where a fulcrum is provided for pinching the plates together and fanning out the contents.</p>
<p id="p-0011" num="0010">It is, therefore, an object of the invention to provide a compact wallet substantially no larger than a credit card. It is a further object to maximize expandability of the wallet to accommodate multiple objects of substantially the same size. It is a further object to protect the contents of the wallet from damage or loss by open-ended drop through. It is a further object to facilitate selection of any one object from the bound group. It is a further object to accommodate folded currency handily on the outside of the wallet. It is a further object to present essentially smooth contours for snag-free passage into and out of pockets of clothing or bags. It is a further object to provide means and method for changing out elastic bounding bands. It is a further object to provide a method for making a compact wallet with different features attached thereto which can be modularly exchanged.</p>
<p id="p-0012" num="0011">These objects, and others to become hereinafter apparent, are embodied in a compact wallet comprising, in a first element, at least two rigid plates interposed to sandwich card-like contents there between, each rigid plate having a longitudinal extent. A second element is at least one encircling elastic band interposed with the at least two rigid plates, over the longitudinal extents thereof, to bias, them inwardly and securely hold the card-like contents, while providing elastic volume between the plates for adding additional contents. A third element is a channeling means configured to minimize the profile of the wallet and hold position of the at least one encircling elastic band with respect to each rigid plate. The channeling means additionally, allows freedom for the dynamic extension and contraction of the band over the entire running length of the band. With such means and in such manner, card-like contents may be carried with minimal silhouette on or with a person while allowing expandable capacity and ready access to individual contents from between the at least two rigid plates.</p>
<p id="p-0013" num="0012">In a preferred embodiment, the channeling means is a longitudinal groove in a first lamina of a laminate construction of each rigid plate. The groove slidingly receives one part of the at least one encircling elastic band. In one instance of the preferred embodiment, a second lamina of the laminate construction of each rigid plate is removably attached to the first lamina to hold the at least one elastic band in capture and provide a smooth surface for glide purposes. In another instance, the second lamina is attached to the first lamina by screws.</p>
<p id="p-0014" num="0013">In an alternate embodiment, a method of making a modular compact wallet comprises the steps of providing a compact wallet having at least two rigid plates each having a groove, at least one groove additionally having a recess, and at least one encircling elastic band interposed in the grooves to bias the plates inwardly; providing a first auxiliary feature having a tang; removably inserting the tang of the first auxiliary feature into the recess to attach the first auxiliary feature to an outside surface of at least one of the rigid plates; selectively removing the first auxiliary feature; selectively providing at least a second auxiliary feature, having a tang; and removably inserting the tang of the second auxiliary feature into the recess to attach the second auxiliary feature to the outside surface.</p>
<p id="p-0015" num="0014">As this is not intended to be an exhaustive recitation, other embodiments may be learned from practicing the invention or may otherwise become apparent to those skilled in the art.</p>

<heading id="h-0008" level="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION</heading>
<p id="p-0030" num="0029">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS <b>1</b> and <b>2</b></figref>, a compact wallet <b>1</b> is comprised of at least two rigid plates <b>10</b>, serving as &#x201c;bookends&#x201d; as it were, with one or more card-like contents <b>2</b> sandwiched between them. The sandwiched composite inbound by at least one encircling elastic band <b>4</b>. The encircling elastic band <b>4</b> holds the card-like contents <b>2</b> securely by means of compression, while also expanding elastically to open space between the rigid plates <b>10</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0031" num="0030">The added volume of the space provides capacity for additional contents. The rigid plates <b>10</b> are sized to the dimensions of a standard credit card and the resulting perimeter defines a profile <b>14</b>. A channeling means <b>20</b> prevents the encircling elastic band <b>4</b> from adding more than negligible breadth to profile <b>14</b>. This profile minimization is accomplished by locating the channeling means <b>20</b> internally to the rigid plates <b>10</b>. In other words, no structures projecting from the profile <b>14</b> are needed to fixture the encircling band <b>4</b>, as in the case of prior art.</p>
<p id="p-0032" num="0031">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS <b>2</b> to <b>9</b></figref>, the channeling means <b>20</b> of the preferred embodiment, is a longitudinal groove <b>21</b> spanning a longitudinal extent <b>3</b> of each rigid plate <b>10</b>. The longitudinal groove <b>21</b> is of such ample dimension as to receive a corresponding part of the encircling elastic band <b>4</b> and allow it to slidingly expand and contract freely while holding position there within. In this way, the full running length of the band can be exercised for expansion while contraction is rendered responsive. The result is a maximally achievable opening between the plates whereby filling volume is optimized.</p>
<p id="p-0033" num="0032">In one preferred embodiment, the longitudinal groove <b>21</b> traverses a first lamina <b>22</b> of a laminate construction of each rigid plate <b>10</b>. The first lamina <b>22</b> is capped with a second lamina <b>23</b> to capture one portion of the encircling elastic band <b>4</b> and complete the channeling means <b>20</b>. The second lamina <b>23</b> is preferably attached removably to the first lamina <b>22</b> to enable the encircling elastic band <b>4</b> to be changed out at the end of its service life. In a particular preferred embodiment, the attachment is made by flat-headed screws <b>24</b> threaded into threaded holes <b>26</b> in the first lamina <b>22</b> through countersunk holes <b>25</b> in the second lamina. The flat-heading and counter-sinking of the screws provide a smooth outer surface to the compact wallet <b>1</b>, thereby permitting snag-free glide into pockets or other containment vessels. In an alternate embodiment, the attachment mechanism may include appropriately placed pressure sensitive adhesive strips (not shown). Other attachment means, known in the art, are also contemplated as within scope.</p>
<p id="p-0034" num="0033">In one preferred embodiment shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS <b>1</b> and <b>10</b></figref>, a finger notch <b>13</b> is provided in the periphery at a proximal end <b>11</b> of each rigid plate <b>10</b> such that the notches of facing plates are aligned. To accomplish the alignment, each plate must be configured in a mirror image of the other. The finger notches <b>13</b> expose an edge of the card like contents <b>2</b>. Using a finger in the finger notch, the card-like contents <b>2</b> can be urged upwardly in a lifting maneuver <b>16</b> by pressing against the exposed edge to elevate the card-like contents above distal ends <b>12</b> of the rigid plates <b>10</b>. The lifting maneuver <b>16</b> makes the card-line contents <b>2</b> available for inspection and selection, which would otherwise be difficult tasks when masked by the plates. The display of contents can be further enhanced by a pinching maneuver <b>17</b>, which is accomplished by pinching the proximal ends <b>11</b> together about the fulcrum of the exposed edge of the contents rendered offset from the proximal ends <b>11</b> by the preceding maneuver. The pinching maneuver <b>17</b> fans open the distal ends <b>12</b> and facilitates separation of the card-like contents for further inspection and ease of selection.</p>
<p id="p-0035" num="0034">In one preferred embodiment, as shown, in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS <b>3</b>-<b>6</b> and <b>9</b></figref>, a first elastic strap <b>5</b> is positioned over the proximal ends <b>11</b> of the rigid plates <b>10</b>. The first elastic strap <b>5</b> registers the card like contents to the proximal ends <b>11</b> and prevents them from slipping beyond the ends when expansion takes place. Preferably, the first elastic strap <b>5</b> is attached to the encircling elastic band <b>4</b> by sewing, or bonding, by access through the transverse groove <b>27</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS <b>2</b> and <b>8</b></figref>). Alternatively, the first elastic strap <b>5</b> is attached to each rigid plate <b>10</b> by any known means. In one preferred embodiment, a second elastic strap <b>6</b> is positioned over the outside surface of one of the rigid plates <b>10</b> to strap thereon currency <b>8</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>), or additional card-like contents <b>2</b>. Preferably, the second elastic strap <b>6</b> is attached to the encircling elastic band <b>4</b> by sewing, or bonding, by access through the longitudinal groove <b>21</b>. Alternatively, the second elastic strap <b>6</b> is attached to the rigid plate <b>10</b> of its intimacy by any known means.</p>
<p id="p-0036" num="0035">In one alternative embodiment, shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS <b>11</b>-<b>13</b></figref>, an auxiliary feature <b>30</b> is added to at least one of the rigid plates <b>10</b> to occupy a position on an outside surface <b>37</b> thereof. Preferably, the auxiliary feature <b>30</b> is a money clip <b>31</b>. Alternatively, the auxiliary feature <b>30</b> may be a windowed envelope <b>32</b> (not shown). The windowed envelope <b>32</b> may be configured to receive a driver's license, a passport card, a military ID, a Global Entry card, or any other card-like content <b>2</b> to be displayed exteriorly to the compact wallet <b>1</b> by means of a transparent window. The money clip <b>31</b> and the windowed envelope <b>32</b>, while exemplifying the concept, are not otherwise considered to be scope-limiting for the auxiliary feature <b>30</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0037" num="0036">The auxiliary feature <b>30</b> is removably attached to at least one of the rigid plates <b>10</b> by means of a tang <b>33</b> inserted into a recess <b>34</b> in the groove <b>21</b> outboard of the elastic band <b>4</b>. The outboard positioning prevents interference with the free operation of the elastic band. In a particularity, the recess <b>34</b> has an undercut <b>35</b> and the tang <b>33</b> has a hook <b>36</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>12</b></figref>). The hook <b>36</b> engages the undercut <b>35</b> to prevent inadvertent dislodgement of the auxiliary feature <b>30</b> when attached to the compact wallet <b>1</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0038" num="0037">In the preferred embodiment, the card-like contents include, but are not limited to, credit cards, a driver's license, ID cards, business cards, affiliation/membership cards, currency bills, loyalty cards, coupons, a calendar, receipts or any paper or card-stock item of a personal or business nature. The rigid plates <b>10</b> are either comprised of metal, or otherwise integrate a metalized surface, for radio-frequency identification (RFID) theft protection purposes, as credit cards are increasingly using RFID chips. A substrate can be metalized by electric deposition, by casting, or otherwise by bonding on or taping on a foil. In the preferred embodiment, the first lamina <b>22</b> is fabricated from aluminum plate of 2 mm gauge by machining. Alternatively, the first lamina <b>22</b> may be 316 stainless steel (SS), or may otherwise be injection molded with high-impact polystyrene (HIPS), acrylonitrile butadiene styrene (ABS) or any resin with stiffness property. The second lamina <b>23</b> may be fabricated from similar materials and methods as the first lamina <b>22</b>, although not necessarily matched thereto. For example, the second lamina <b>23</b> may be die-cut from polystyrene sheet stock of 0.7 mm gauge and mated with machined SS from plate stock used for the first lamina <b>22</b> The rigid plates <b>10</b>, and the profile <b>14</b> by definition, preferably measure approximately 8.5 cm by 5.4 cm. In the preferred embodiment, the flat-headed screws <b>24</b> are comprised of 316 SS; but may also in the alternative, be made of aluminum or any other metal alloy. The encircling elastic band <b>4</b>, the first elastic strap <b>5</b> and second elastic strap <b>6</b> may be any rubber, or rubberized, material configured in a web. In the preferred embodiment, the band and straps are of 3 cm woven elastic fabric, such as that found at the John Howard Company. Alternatively, the bands and straps, may differ from each other in materials and sizes.</p>
<p id="p-0039" num="0038">The compact wallet <b>1</b> may be provided at retail in a system configuration with a tool, such as a driver (not shown), to assist with assembly or disassembly. The system may also include an instruction card (not shown), or pamphlet, a spare encircling elastic band <b>4</b> or one or more spare flat-headed screws <b>24</b>. The compact wallet <b>1</b> may supplied either assembled or disassembled in the system configuration.</p>
