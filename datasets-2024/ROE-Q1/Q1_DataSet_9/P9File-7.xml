<p id="p-0006" num="0005">The invention is in the field of insect control.</p>
<heading id="h-0003" level="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">Modern agriculture relies on high density production facilities. In many cases the production cycle is long and waste from livestock housed in the facility accumulates in the facility for long periods. The accumulated waste becomes a breeding ground for flies and other insects.</p>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">For example, laying hens are often housed for many months in a closed facility. In many cases waste is not removed from the facility during this entire period. Flies lay eggs in the waste. The eggs hatch into larva and the larva turn to pupa which mature into flies which then mate and lay more eggs. If the fly population is not controlled, conditions in the facility quickly become intolerable for animals and/or humans.</p>
<p id="p-0009" num="0008">Current fly population control measures rely on chemical insecticides and/or traps.</p>
<p id="p-0010" num="0009">Use of chemical insecticides in commercial agriculture is controversial due to concerns about the possibility of toxic residues in food products.</p>
<p id="p-0011" num="0010">Cyromazine is a triazine insect growth regulator (IGR) used as an insecticide. It is a cyclopropyl derivative of melamine. Cyromazine interferes with the molting process of larvae and pupation.</p>
<p id="p-0012" num="0011">IGR classes include chitin synthesis inhibitors, juvenile hormone mimics, juvenile hormone analogs, molting hormone agonists, molting hormone analogs and molting inhibitors.</p>
<p id="p-0013" num="0012">Common chitin synthesis inhibitors include but are not limited to bistfluron, buprofezin, chlorfluazorun, Cyromazine, diflubenzuron, flucycloxuron, flufenoxuron, hexaflumuron, lufenuron, noyaluron, noyiflumuron, penfluron, teflubenzuron, and triflumuron.</p>
<p id="p-0014" num="0013">Common juvenile hormone mimics include but are not limited to epofenonane, fenoxycarb, hydroprene, kinoprene, methoprene, pyriproxyfen, and triprene.</p>
<p id="p-0015" num="0014">Common juvenile hormone analogs include but are not limited to juvenile hormone i, juvenile hormone ii, and juvenile hormone iii.</p>
<p id="p-0016" num="0015">Common molting hormone agonists include but are not limited to chromafenozide, halofenozide, methoxyfenozide, and tebufenozide.</p>
<p id="p-0017" num="0016">Common molting hormone analogs include but are not limited to &#x3b1;-ecdysone and ecdysterone.</p>
<p id="p-0018" num="0017">Diofenolan is a common molting inhibitor.</p>
<p id="p-0019" num="0018">In veterinary medicine, Cyromazine is used as an ectoparasiticide. In commercial agriculture, Cyromazine is sometimes included in livestock feed so that Cyromazine in fecal matter will contribute to insect control.</p>
<p id="p-0020" num="0019">Cyromazine is digestible by many animals. Cyromazine is metabolized to melamine and melamine and/or Cyromazine can be detected in meat and/or eggs and/or milk of animals fed Cyromazine.</p>
<p id="p-0021" num="0020">One commercially available Cyromazine product is LARVADEX. LARVADEX is supplied as a Cyromazine premix for inclusion in poultry feed. The LARVADEX label instruction call for inclusion of 5 grams of Cyromazine in 1000 Kg of feed. When used as directed, the concentration of Cyromazine in the feed is 5 PPM.</p>
<heading id="h-0004" level="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0022" num="0021">One aspect of some embodiments of the invention relates to insect life cycle interruption agents. For purposes of this specification and the accompanying claims, the term &#x201c;life cycle interruption agent (LCIA)&#x201d; indicates a material that reduces a rate of growth of a population of insects when present at or above a minimum effective concentration (MEC) in accumulated waste where insect eggs are normally deposited. According to various exemplary embodiments of the invention, LCIA interfere with reproduction and/or egg-hatch and/or molting from one stage to the next. Some, but not all, LCIA have larvicidal activity.</p>
<p id="p-0023" num="0022">One aspect of some embodiments of the invention relates to a feed additive including enteric coated particles containing saponin. In some embodiments <i>Yucca </i>powder serves as a source of saponin. The enteric coating is formulated to allow the particles to pass through the digestive tract of livestock and be deposited in the waste without the saponin being inactivated and/or absorbed. In some embodiments the particles have a diameter range of 500 microns to 1400 microns with 1000 microns average diameter as determined by sieving through a series of sieves with decreasing mesh sizes. In some embodiments the saponin in the waste exert a larvastatic and/or larvicidal effect. Because waste is accumulating every day, the larvicide is applied automatically throughout the production cycle so long as the enteric coated particles containing saponin are present in the feed.</p>
<p id="p-0024" num="0023">Another aspect of some embodiments of the invention relates to methods of manufacturing the enteric coated particles containing saponin. In some embodiments <i>Yucca </i>powder serves as a source of saponin. In some embodiments the manufacturing method includes wet granulation. According to various exemplary embodiments of the invention wet granulation formulations include <i>Yucca </i>powder and/or Cornstarch and/or maltodextrin and/or</p>
<p id="p-0025" num="0024">Carboxymethylcellulose (CMC) and/or sodium alginate. In other exemplary embodiments of the invention, a dry granulation is employed in a formulation which includes microcrystalline cellulose (MCC). Alternatively or additionally, in various embodiments the manufacturing process includes enteric coating by hydroxypropyl methylcellulose phthalate (HP-55) in an organic solution (e.g. acetone and/or methanol) or enteric coating by stearic acid.</p>
<p id="p-0026" num="0025">Another aspect of some embodiments of the invention relates to using the animal as a vehicle to distribute the pest controlling material to the target area. The formulation of the saponin source in a way that prevent its inactivation is required as unprotected saponin is inactivated in the acidic portion of the digestive tract.</p>
<p id="p-0027" num="0026">Another aspect of some embodiments of the invention relates to an additional coating that protects saponin from inactivation in the rumen.</p>
<p id="p-0028" num="0027">For purposes of this specification and the accompanying claims, the term &#x201c;saponin&#x201d; is to be interpreted in its broadest possible scope so that it includes also derivatives and related compounds including but not limited to Triterpenoid Saponin, Triterpene saponin, Steroidal saponin, Steroid saponin, Oleanane-type triterpenoid saponin, Oleane-type saponin, Dioscin (a steroidal triterpene saponin), Lycyrrhizin, Oleanolic saponin, pentacyclic triterpenoid saponin, Monodesmosidic glucuronide saponin, Furostanol saponin, Spirostane-type saponin, Spirostanol Saponin, Cytotoxic Saponin, Molluscicidal saponin, Glucuronide Desacyl-jegosaponin, Desacylboninsaponin A, and Chikusetsusaponin V methyl ester.</p>
<p id="p-0029" num="0028">Another aspect of some embodiments of the invention relates maintaining an effective level of an IGR to control flies in manure while reducing IGR residues in food products. In some embodiments the manure is poultry litter and the food product is eggs.</p>
<p id="p-0030" num="0029">Another aspect of some embodiments of the invention relates to adsorption of an IGR on granulated particles of inert material (e.g. silicate). According to various exemplary embodiments of the invention the granulation is a wet process or a dry process.</p>
<p id="p-0031" num="0030">Another aspect of some embodiments of the invention relates to encapsulation of an IGR with one or more coatings. In some embodiments the IGR to be coated is provided as granules. According to various exemplary embodiments of the invention the coatings include ethyl cellulose and/or an enteric coating (e.g. hydroxypropyl methylcellulose phthalate (HP-55)) and/or a saturated fat (e.g. hydrogenated palm oil) and/or another layer of ethyl cellulose. According to various exemplary embodiments of the invention 1, 2, 3 or 4 or more coatings are applied. In some embodiments the one or more coatings are applied to a core of IGR adsorbed on granulated silica or another inert material. In some embodiments the IGR is Cyromazine.</p>
<p id="p-0032" num="0031">Still another aspect of some embodiments of the invention relates to use of less than 5 PPM of Cyromazine in poultry feed to effectively inhibit propagation of fly's larvae in poultry manure. According to various exemplary embodiments of the invention the feed contains 4 PPM of Cyromazine, 3 PPM of Cyromazine, 2 PPM of Cyromazine, 1 PPM of Cyromazine or intermediate or lower concentrations of Cyromazine.</p>
<p id="p-0033" num="0032">Still another aspect of some embodiments of the invention relates to use of Naturally Occurring Insecticidal Toxins (NOIT) that are widely described in the literature (see for example: Opender Koul (2016) The Handbook of Naturally Occurring Insecticidal Toxins Insect Biopesticide Research Centre, Jalandhar, India and Zoubiri and Baaliouamer (2014), &#x201c;Potentiality of plants as source of insecticide principles&#x201d; Journal of Saudi Chemical Society 18: 925-938 and Suke Dev and Opender Koul (2019) Insecticides of Natural Origin; each of which is fully incorporated herein by reference).</p>
<p id="p-0034" num="0033">Briefly, various NOIT are derived from plants and/or Microorganisms and/or Marine Organisms and/or Proteases. The following plant families are believed to be promising sources of NOIT: Annonaceae, Apocynaceae, Bignoneaceae, Cryptogams, Euphorbiaceae, Labiateae, Limiaceae, Moraceae, Pinaceae, Ranunculaceae, Rubiaceae, Solanaceae, Apiaceae, Asteraceae, Piperaceae, Cupressaceae, Fabaceae, Leguminosae, Meliaceae, Myrtaceae, Poaceae, Rosaceae, Rutaceae and Verbenaceae.</p>

<heading id="h-0015" level="2">Assaying Saponin Concentration</heading>
<p id="p-0107" num="0106">Percentages of saponin are assayed by a spectrophotometric assay as set forth here. The spectrophotometric assay gives a total saponin content. This method is robust and easy for quantification of saponin in plant extracts and feeds. It requires only common solvents to extract the saponins plant material such as <i>yucca </i>powder or from premixes or feeds. The method is set forth briefly and additional details are available in <i>Journal of AOAC International</i>, (2000) Vol 83(6), 1451-1454 and in <i>Journal of Nanomedicine Research </i>(2019) Vol 8 (1), 6-12 each of which is widely known and each of which is fully incorporated herein by reference.</p>
<p id="p-0108" num="0107">Initially saponin is extracted into a water/ethanol mixture. The ethanol is removed by evaporation and saponins are back extracted from the water phase into 3 aliquots of n-butanol. The combined n-butanol fraction is evaporated to dryness at 90&#xb0; C. The extract is the purified with HP-20 resin and saponin fraction is eluted by 95% methanol solution.</p>
<p id="p-0109" num="0108">The methanol eluate containing saponin is then concentrated by evaporation of methanol and hydrolyzed with a mixture of HCl 2M/ethanol (1:1) to produce two fractions: a sapogenin (steroid) and a sugar moiety.</p>
<p id="p-0110" num="0109">The sapogenin is extracted with diethyl ether and dehydrated with sodium sulfate. The ether is evaporated and the remaining residue is dissolved in ethyl acetate for spectrophotometric assay.</p>
<p id="p-0111" num="0110">P-anisaldehyde and sulfuric acid are used as reagent for color development. Sapogenin extract, standard (Sarasapogenin from Sigma-Aldrich) and blank (Ethyl acetate) are simultaneously incubated at 60&#xb0; C. in a shaking water bath with the color development reagents. After cooling, absorbance is measured at 430 nm and the total saponin content is then expressed in mg of standard equivalents per gram of sample.</p>
<p id="p-0112" num="0111">It is believed that the lowest detectable level of saponin with this assay is 1 PPM.</p>
<p id="p-0113" num="0112">Direct assays of saponin in dried ground manure are believed to be possible but have not yet been performed.</p>
<p id="p-0114" num="0113">Exemplary Theoretical Calculation of Degree of Saponin Protection</p>
<p id="p-0115" num="0114">Using the % of feed digestibility in layers (which is a known quantity) it is possible to estimate the amount of excrement per unit feed consumed. If the amount of Saponin in the feed is known, the amount of saponin in manure can be calculated.</p>
<p id="p-0116" num="0115">The calculation for a 100 ppm dose of saponin in feed is as follows: A laying hen consumes approximately 120 gr of feed per day containing 0.012 gr saponin (100 ppm). The feed contains about 10% moisture. Roughly 40% of the dry matter in feed is excreted meaning about 43 gram of dry matter excreted. The manure contains roughly 65% moisture. This means 43 gram of dry matter from feed is about 35% of the wet manure. The amount of manure that 1 bird excreted per day is about 123 gr of wet material (dry matter+moisture). Assuming that the excreta contains all the saponin originally present in the feed that the hen consumed, 0.012 gr, it means the excreta contains 0.01% saponin or 100 mg/kg of wet manure. This corresponds to 100 PPM on a wet basis or about 285 ppm on a dry matter basis.</p>
<p id="p-0117" num="0116">This calculation was based on conjecture as it is unknown how much of the encapsulated saponin granules stay intact after the passage through the digestive system. Results presented in examples 6 through 10 show that this conjecture was correct.</p>

<p id="p-0138" num="0137">Exemplary Use of Naturally Occurring Insecticidal Toxins (NOIT)</p>
<p id="p-0139" num="0138">Naturally Occurring Insecticidal Toxins (NOIT) are widely described in the literature (see for example Opender Koul (2016) The Handbook of Naturally Occurring Insecticidal Toxins Insect Biopesticide Research Centre, Jalandhar, India; &#x201c;Potentiality of plants as source of insecticide principles&#x201d; Zoubiri and Baaliouamer (2014) Journal of Saudi Chemical Society 18: 925-938 and Opender Koul (2019) Insecticides of Natural Origin; each of which is fully incorporated herein by reference). Many NOIT are flavonoids, phenols or terpenes.</p>
<p id="p-0140" num="0139">In the context of various exemplary embodiments of the invention, NOIT with demonstrable activity against flies are of the most interest. Saponin is one example of an NOIT with demonstrable activity against flies. Other Examples of NOIT with demonstrable activity against flies include, but are not limited to Steroidal aglycone, Steroidal glycosides, Bidentatoside, Gamboukokoensides A and B, Ginsenosides, glycosides of triterpenoid aglycones, hederagenincellobioside, oleanolic acid cellobioside, epihederagenincellobioside, gypsogenincellobioside, Triterpenoids, Cytotoxic pentacyclic triterpenes, Triterpene glycoside, Astersedifolioside A, B and C, Gypenosides, Sapogenol A and B, Polyhydroxyoleanene, Aesculiosides, Barringtosides A, B and C, ceposide A, ceposide B, and ceposide C, Furostanol glycosides, steroids of spirostan and furostan series, Seco-glycopyranosyl moiety, Triterpenicaglycone, and Triterpene glucosides.</p>
<p id="p-0141" num="0140">Although these materials have not yet been tested in vivo, as was done with Saponin, their insecticidal activity is known and is independent of the properties of the various coating materials and coating methodologies described above.</p>
<p id="p-0142" num="0141">Experimental examples provided hereinbelow offer guidance for implementation of additional exemplary embodiments of the invention by a skilled practitioner using other NOITs.</p>
<p id="p-0143" num="0142">Exemplary Advantages</p>
<p id="p-0144" num="0143">The application describes use of coating materials that are known in the pharmaceutical industry. However, the way in which they are employed differs from common pharmaceutical practice. The pharmaceutical industry is typically attempting to achieve a delayed release or sustained release profile of the active pharmaceutical ingredient (API). However, the pharmaceutical industry is typically interested in high levels of absorption of the API into the body.</p>
<p id="p-0145" num="0144">In sharp contrast, the described embodiments of the invention use the known coating materials to ensure that the API (an in-feed life cycle interruption agent (LCIA)) passes through the animal with little or no digestion and/or absorption. In this way, activity of the LCIA is preserved/moreover, the coating not only protect the LCIA from released in the body but allow it to be released in the waste of the animal that consumed the food containing it.</p>
<p id="p-0146" num="0145">This approach to coating represents a significant departure from known practice and provides a new category of agricultural products.</p>
<p id="p-0147" num="0146">It is expected that during the life of this patent many additional coating materials and/or LCIA and/or IGRs and/or NOIT will be developed and the scope of the invention is intended to include all such new technologies a priori.</p>
<p id="p-0148" num="0147">Although the invention has been described in conjunction with specific embodiments thereof, it is evident that many alternatives, modifications and variations will be apparent to those skilled in the art. Accordingly, it is intended to embrace all such alternatives, modifications and variations that fall within the spirit and broad scope of the appended claims.</p>
<p id="p-0149" num="0148">Specifically, a variety of numerical indicators have been utilized. It should be understood that these numerical indicators could vary even further based upon a variety of engineering principles, materials, intended use and designs incorporated into the various embodiments of the invention. Additionally, components and/or actions ascribed to exemplary embodiments of the invention and depicted as a single unit may be divided into subunits. Conversely, components and/or actions ascribed to exemplary embodiments of the invention and depicted as sub-units/individual actions may be combined into a single unit/action with the described/depicted function.</p>
<p id="p-0150" num="0149">Alternatively, or additionally, features used to describe a method can be used to characterize an apparatus and features used to describe an apparatus can be used to characterize a method.</p>
<p id="p-0151" num="0150">It should be further understood that the individual features described hereinabove can be combined in all possible combinations and sub-combinations to produce additional embodiments of the invention. The examples given above are exemplary in nature and do not limit the scope of the invention which is defined solely by the following claims.</p>
<p id="p-0152" num="0151">Each recitation of an embodiment of the invention that includes a specific feature, part, component, ingredient module or process is an explicit statement that additional embodiments of the invention not including the recited feature, part, component, module, ingredient or process exist.</p>
<p id="p-0153" num="0152">Alternatively or additionally, various exemplary embodiments of the invention exclude any specific feature, part, component, module, ingredient, process or element which is not specifically disclosed herein.</p>
<p id="p-0154" num="0153">Specifically, the invention has been described in the context of poultry (such as layer hens) but might also be used in the context of other monogastric animals such as swine, rabbits, dogs and horses. Alternatively or additionally, by adding an additional coating that protects the LCIA (e.g saponin and/or an IGR such as Cyromazine) from inactivation in a rumen, it is believed the invention can be implemented in ruminants such as cattle, sheep and goats.</p>

Results summarized in table 5 indicate treatment group B, <i>yucca </i>powder with 500 ppm saponin dose had almost no living larvae and pupae and was the group with highest number of dead larvae and pupae. This was statistically significant from the rest of the treatment group but not from the positive control with LARVADEX.
</p>
<p id="p-0185" num="0193">It is not clear why in the larvae seeds cups the survival rate was higher than that of the eggs seeds cup. It is possible that the difference is due to maybe due to a naturally low hatching rate.</p>
<p id="p-0186" num="0194">These results indicate that the average larvae survival rate was 95% at the negative control larvae seeded cups, while in the seeded eggs cups, at that group, the survival rate was only 52%.</p>
<p id="p-0187" num="0195">Out of all the examined groups, group B, the <i>Yucca </i>powder with a 500-ppm dose, had the best pesticide effect with survival rate of 2%-7% meaning 93-98% mortality. This result was statistically significant.</p>
<p id="p-0188" num="0196">The Butanol extract and water extract prepared from biopowder had no significant larvicide effect. Among the extracts treatment, treatment F-Butanol Saponin extraction of <i>yucca </i>plant powder at a Saponin dose of 350 ppm, showed the most larvicide effect with a mortality rate of 55%.</p>
<p id="p-0189" num="0197">Results of this example demonstrate that <i>Yucca </i>extracts were not effective in killing larvae.</p>
<p id="p-0190" num="0198">In sharp contrast, <i>Yucca </i>plant powder with a nominal concentration in manure of 500 ppm saponin has significant larvicidal activity in the manure. The actual concentration in manure is presumed to be lower than this. This suggests that if Saponin could be incorporated into feed in way that allows it to pass though the digestive tract without inactivation, it could function as a larvacide in manure.</p>

<p id="p-0191" num="0199">Example 6 demonstrated that 500 ppm of Saponin from <i>Yucca </i>plant powder (<i>Yucca </i>Schidigera), showed a larvacidal activity of almost 100% on larvae (survival rate was 2%-7%).</p>
<p id="p-0192" num="0200">An additional study was conducted to determine the Minimal Inhibitory Concentration (MIC) of Saponin from <i>Yucca </i>plant powder for larvae. In addition, <i>yucca </i>saponin extract was tested again.</p>
<p id="p-0193" num="0201">Experiment Design:</p>
<p id="p-0194" num="0202">Excrement from commercial laying hens was collected and frozen, dried and ground as in the previous example.</p>
<p id="p-0195" num="0203">The dried ground excrement was spread in 60 disposable cups, 6 cups replicate for A-I group treatments and 3 cup replicates for treatments J-K.</p>
<p id="p-0196" num="0204">The cups were filled with 30 grams of excrement that was mixed with 70 ml of water/extract solution (according to the treatment groups below), so the humidity of the excrement will be 70% as in a typical laying house. The cups were marked with the group letters and replicate number.</p>
<p id="p-0197" num="0205">Statistical evaluation was done with Jump 07 software. Analysis of variance done with Anova test and the comparison of means done with Tukey-Kramer test, significance level-&#x3b1;=0.05.</p>
<p id="p-0198" num="0206">Treatment Groups:</p>
<p id="p-0199" num="0207">(A) Negative control (waste without any larvacid supplement)</p>

<p id="p-0208" num="0216">(J) Positive control-Larvadex (0.5% Cyromazine)-dose equivalent to 1000 gr/ton of feed: 540 mg in 1000 ml water.</p>
<p id="p-0209" num="0217">(k) Biology activity negative control&#x2014;waste without any larvicide supplement. No fly eggs/larvae seeded in the waste.</p>
<p id="p-0210" num="0218"><i>Yucca </i>powder is insoluble in water; therefore, the <i>yucca </i>powder of groups B-E was mixed with the dried waste. For homogeneity, the mixing made with mechanic mixer for 5 minutes.</p>
<p id="p-0211" num="0219">All disposable cups were seeded with 30 house fly's 1St stage larvae.</p>
<p id="p-0212" num="0220">After a week the waste was washed and filtered through a sieve. The larvae and pupae were collected from the sieve and counted.</p>
<p id="p-0213" num="0221">Results are summarized in Table 6.</p>
<p id="p-0214" num="0222">As shown in Table 6, the <i>yucca </i>powder was effective in all tested doses (150 ppm &#x2212;500 ppm saponin), with 0%-4.8% survival rate. These results are significantly different from the negative control group, commercial extract group and the Butanol extract group.</p>
<p id="p-0215" num="0223">Table 6 also shows that the commercial extract was ineffective with an average survival rate of 88%, not significantly different from the negative control and the Butanol extract.</p>
<p id="p-0216" num="0224">Table 6 also shows that Butanol extract was ineffective with, a survival rate of 78.3%, not significantly different from the negative control and the commercial extract.</p>

<p id="p-0218" num="0225">Table 6 also shows that the extract with water and the extract with water+ethanol (each 500 PPM saponin) were both effective with a survival rate of 2.2% and 8.3% respectively, significantly different from the negative control, commercial extract group and the Butanol extract group.</p>
<p id="p-0219" num="0226">This dose dependence study shows that saponin from <i>Yucca </i>plant powder had a distinct larvicidal activity even at the lowest dose of 150 ppm saponin in manure.</p>
<p id="p-0220" num="0227">This trial, like Example 6, showed that <i>Yucca </i>extract, whether a commercial one or made by the investigator's had no larvicidal effect except for the water Saponin extractions of <i>yucca </i>plant powder at a dose of 500 ppm.</p>
<p id="p-0221" num="0228">Results of Examples 6 and 7 suggest that if the formulations of examples 1 to 6 can deliver &#x2265;150 ppm of Saponin in manure when fed to birds, there will be a larvicidal effect.</p>

<p id="p-0222" num="0229">In order to protect the saponin molecules and keep its activity throughout the digestive system of the laying hens it needs to be granulated and encapsulated. Moreover, the saponin need to stay stable in the digestive tract and to be released and act in the manure of the birds, where flies lay their eggs.</p>
<p id="p-0223" num="0230">For this reason a granulated and encapsulated <i>Yucca </i>powder product, preparation <i>Yucca </i>134 (prepared as in Example 4 above) was evaluated to determine its biological efficacy in a relevant agricultural context. <i>Yucca </i>134 is a granulated and encapsulated <i>Yucca </i>powder, particle size 500-1400 micron containing 3.6% Saponin.</p>
<p id="p-0224" num="0231">For this experiment 12 Lohman laying hens, housed in conventional cages, were divided into 3 groups, four layer per group 2 hens in a cage.</p>

<p id="p-0252" num="0258">The granulated, not encapsulated, <i>Yucca </i>powder showed 56% survival in the fresh waste. The survival rate in the frozen waste was higher than 100% which indicate a possible counting mistake when seeding the eggs. In this group there were no pupae.</p>
<p id="p-0253" num="0259">Even at the highest tested saponin concentration (300 PPM, Group C) there was no negative effect on layer's performance (average egg size and laying percentage).</p>
<p id="p-0254" num="0260">These results suggest that the lowest effective larvicidal dose of encapsulated Saponin is 100 PPM in feed which corresponds to 2.8 Kg. of <i>Yucca </i>134 per ton of feed. This amount allowed only 15% of flies to survive and appears to be the MIC of protected saponin in feed These results are consistent with the results of example 8 which demonstrated the protective effect of 200 PPM of protected saponin in feed.</p>

<p id="p-0267" num="0271">Results summarized in Table 11 indicate that 100 ppm encapsulated saponin in feed and less were not larvacidic. Results from Groups D, E and F were not statistically different from the negative control group. Compare to results from Example 9 in which 150 PPM allowed only 6% of larva to survive.</p>
<p id="p-0268" num="0272">Group C with 200 ppm encapsulated saponin was statistically different from the rest of the treatment groups with survival rate of only 5%. This result is not significantly different from the results obtained with 0.5% cyromazine in Group B.</p>
<p id="p-0269" num="0273">The encapsulated pelleted <i>Yucca </i>powder of Group I (100 ppm saponins) also showed no larvicidal effect. As expected, the non-encapsulated preparations of groups G and H did not have a larvicidal effect despite a nominal saponin concentration in the feed of 200 PPM.</p>
<p id="p-0270" num="0274">Results summarized in Table 11 confirm that 200 ppm encapsulated saponin is larvicidal for fly larvae. These results do not contradict the results of Example 9 which suggested that the MIC of encapsulated saponin is 100 PPM.</p>
<p id="p-0271" num="0275">Results summarized in Table 11 confirm the importance of encapsulation in vivo. The un-encapsulated <i>yucca </i>preparations were ineffective, even at the same nominal saponin concentration.</p>
<p id="p-0272" num="0276">The encapsulated pelleted <i>Yucca </i>powder of group (I) also showed no effect probably because the 100 ppm saponin concentration is below the MIC determined in this experiment.</p>
<p id="p-0273" num="0277">Examples 8 through 10 demonstrate that amounts &#x2265;100 PPM of protected Saponin in feed demonstrate a larvicidal effect in manure. Examples 6 and 7 demonstrate that the equivalent of &#x2265;150 PPM as if in feed placed directly in manure produced a larvicidal effect (assuming 100% passes through the digestive tract). Examples 6 through 10 together suggest that incorporation of &#x2265;100 PPM of protected Saponin in feed leads to appearance of larvicidal effect of &#x2265;150 PPM (simulated in feed) of saponin in manure. There is no direct assay to establish that feed saponin that appears in the manure is still protected in the manure.</p>
<p id="p-0274" num="0278">However, it can be assumed that the saponins in the manure are protected since there is a larvacidial effect (non encapsulated showed no effect at the same dose) and also because it has the same coating as of the Cyromazine product which is probably protected in the manure as the amount of Cyromazine in the eggs indicate that it is hardly absorbed.</p>

<p id="p-0279" num="0283">1400 g of CYR-155 were coated in a fluid bed coater with a 1400 g melted hydrogenated palm oil. The resultant lipid coated product was called CYR-162.</p>

<p id="p-0293" num="0294">Results summarized in Table 13 confirm the efficacy of Cyromazine as an insecticide. The negative control group showed 88% survival compared to 0-0.83% in the Cyromazine-treated groups. The Non-Granulated Non-Encapsulated Cyromazine (NGNEC) group had 0% survival at a dose of 5 ppm similar to the positive control (LARVADEX) group.</p>
<p id="p-0294" num="0295">As expected, LARVADEX 0.5% and CYR234 at a dose of 5 ppm each provided 0% fly survival.</p>
<p id="p-0295" num="0296">Superiority of CYR234 with respect to LARVADEX was demonstrated at 2.5 ppm Cyromazine (0% survival) and 1.5 ppm Cyromazine (0.83% survival). In other words, even at 30% of the Cyromazine concentration routinely used for a conventional formulation, the protected formulation inhibited the development of flies. This inhibition was not significantly different from LARVADEX at the accepted concentration of 5 ppm.</p>
<p id="p-0296" num="0297">These results suggest that protected formulations according to various exemplary embodiments of the invention can be used at significantly lower concentrations in animal feed without sacrificing insecticidal activity in manure.</p>

<p id="p-0297" num="0298">In order to see whether protected formulations according to various exemplary embodiments of the invention can contribute to a reduction in Cyromazine residues in eggs, eggs from the different experimental groups were harvested and assayed for Cyromazine content.</p>
<p id="p-0298" num="0299">After four weeks of feeding according to the experimental groups of example 13, eggs were collected.</p>

The contents of the 4 eggs (without the shell) of each bird were pooled in one container marked to indicate the treatment. Each container was a sample. A total of 4 tests were performed for each treatment. The containers were packed in a temperature-controlled pack that was sent for Cyromazine analysis to Eurofines laboratory in Germany.</p>
<p id="p-0300" num="0301">Cyromazine Analysis was Conducted as Follows:</p>
<p id="p-0301" num="0302">Samples are weighed and one or more samples is spiked with an internal standard.</p>

<p id="p-0306" num="0306">Results presented in Table 14 also indicate that hens fed CYR234 at a concentration of 5 PPM deposited significantly less Cyromazine in eggs than hen fed LARVADEX 5 PPM or NGNEC 5 PPM. NGNEC is powdered, LARVADEX is granulated and CYR234 is granulated and encapsulated. Thus, results summarized in Table 14 indicate that coating in combination with granulation (CYR234) significantly reduced (24%) the amount of Cyromazine in the eggs relative to granulation alone (LARVADEX).</p>
<p id="p-0307" num="0307">Results presented in Table 14 also indicate that the amount of Cyromazine found in eggs increased as the concentration of CYR234 in the feed increased. The group fed CYR234 at 1.5 ppm was the lowest (0.017) which is 80% lower than birds fed a conventional diet containing LARVADEX at a 5 PPM Cyromazine concentration. The European MRL (maximum residue level) for Cyromazine in eggs is 0.01 mg/kg.</p>
<p id="p-0308" num="0308"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b></figref> is a plot of Cyromazine concentration in eggs (mg/kg) as a function of Cyromazine concentration in feed (PPM). <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b></figref> demonstrates that there is a good correlation (R2=0.9893) between the amount of Cyromazine given in feed as CYR234 and that found in eggs. Based on this correlation coefficient, it can be assumed that a reduction in the amount of Cyromazine in the feed to approx. 1.2 ppm will lead to Cyromazine residues in eggs below the European MRL. This conclusion needs to be investigated also in terms of insecticidal activity.</p>

Both CYR 234 and CYR 162 were tested at 5 ppm Cyromazine dose and CYR234 was tested also at 1.5 ppm. CYR234 at 1.5 ppm resulted in 0.67% fly's survival, and the residual Cyromazine level in the eggs was 0.017 mg/kg, which is close to European MRL (0.001 mg/kg).</p>

<p id="p-0315" num="0314">Groups A, B, and C are control groups for the other groups to demonstrate that the coating does not adversely influence Cyromazine activity. This is apparent from the larvacidal effect data presented below.</p>
<p id="p-0316" num="0315">Trial Method:</p>
<p id="p-0317" num="0316">In order to compare the relative insecticidal activity in the different treatment groups, samples of manure were collected and incubated with controlled amounts of fly larva. After three weeks of feeding according to the experimental groups (Table 15), manure was collected from each group of birds. The manure was frozen for 4 days to destroy any insects present and then thawed.</p>
<p id="p-0318" num="0317">For each experimental group, 5 cups containing 100 g thawed manure were prepared (70-80% moisture). Each cup represents a group replicate (n=5). Thirty young fly larvae (stage 1) were placed in each cup and incubated in an insectarium for 7 days. After seven days the pupae/larvae/flies were counted. Results are summarized in Table 16. Analysis of variance was done using a One Way Anova test and the comparison of means was done with Tukey-Kramer test, significance level-&#x3b1;=0.05.</p>
<p id="p-0319" num="0318">Results summarized in Table 16 confirm that even at the lowest Cyromazine dose (1 ppm) the tested products are efficient in controlling larvae development (maximum survival rate&#x2014;2%). CYR348 and CYR 349 appear equally effective. Particles size of CYR349 did not appear to influence survival rate.</p>
<p id="p-0320" num="0319">The survival rate of the negative control (M) was 62% which was lower than the expected, nonetheless the corrected survival rates were still significantly lower than the control (the maximum corrected survival rate was 3.2% at CYR349 in 1 ppm and 1000 &#x3bc;M).</p>
<p id="p-0321" num="0320">In summary, these results indicate that a 1 ppm Cyromazine dose of CYR349 or CYR348 in feed is effective in controlling the development of fly larvae in resultant waste.</p>
<p id="p-0322" num="0321">In addition, these results indicate that the coating protects the Cyromazine in the birds body so that it passes through undigested and is released in the waste. The level of protection is high enough that even 1 ppm Cyromazine in feed provides larvicidal activity in the waste.</p>
