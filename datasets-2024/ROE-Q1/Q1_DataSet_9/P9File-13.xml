<p id="p-0002" num="0001">The present invention relates to a brush for the application of fluid products, particularly for powdery, creamy, liquid products or the like.</p>
<heading id="h-0002" level="1">BACKGROUND ART</heading>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">With particular, but not exclusive, reference to the cosmetic sector, various types of brush are known, differing in both shape and size, to be used according to the type of application and the aesthetic result to be obtained.</p>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">In general, all brushes have a gripping body that is particularly adapted to be gripped and held by a user.</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">The gripping body, which is usually elongated, comprises one end which is intended to be associated with an application body, i.e. the part of the brush which is adapted to take the cosmetic product and apply it to the areas of the skin to be made up.</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">The housing seat is obtained on an intermediate element, called a ferrule, generally made of metal material and provided with a special cavity defining the housing seat itself.</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">Furthermore, the application body comprises a plurality of spreading elements, generally natural or synthetic hairs, which are inserted at least partly into the housing seat so as to be surrounded by the intermediate element and retained therein by means of glue or other adhesive substances.</p>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">Depending on the shape of the housing seat and the insertion technique, the portion of the hairs that comes out of the housing seat gives the application body different shapes depending on the type of brush.</p>
<p id="p-0009" num="0008">In this case, each hair has a first end retained inside the housing seat and a second end free and protruding from the housing seat itself, so that it can be used to pick up and apply the cosmetic product.</p>
<p id="p-0010" num="0009">In the assembly phase, the spreading elements are glued to the housing seat which, in turn, is associated with the gripping portion by interposition of an adhesive layer.</p>
<p id="p-0011" num="0010">In summary, the brushes of known type consist of five components: the gripping portion, the intermediate element (the ferrule), the application body and two layers of adhesive material, which are intended to allow the association of the spreading elements with the ferrule and of the ferrule with the gripping portion, respectively.</p>
<p id="p-0012" num="0011">It is easy to understand that the manufacturing processes of the brushes currently on the market do have numerous drawbacks due to the presence of a plurality of materials and of numerous components that must be assembled to each other.</p>
<p id="p-0013" num="0012">In this regard, it should be noted that the gripping portion is generally made of plastic material, the ferrule is usually made of aluminum and the spreading elements are made of further different materials, such as synthetic or natural yarns.</p>
<p id="p-0014" num="0013">In view of the complex combination of materials and components required to manufacture such brushes, the recycling procedures for these brushes are also extremely complex and laborious.</p>
<p id="p-0015" num="0014">In fact, to enable the brushes to be recycled, they have to be disassembled into their individual components.</p>
<p id="p-0016" num="0015">Nevertheless, the combination of materials, which are extremely diverse, does not allow complete recycling, thus increasing the waste of materials and the associated environmental impact.</p>
<heading id="h-0003" level="1">DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0017" num="0016">The main aim of the present invention is to devise a brush for the application of fluid products, particularly for powdery, creamy, liquid products or the like, which allows greatly simplifying the related processes of manufacturing, assembling and recycling of the same.</p>
<p id="p-0018" num="0017">One object of the present invention is to devise a brush for the application of fluid products, particularly for powdery, creamy, liquid products or the like, which allows reducing the number of components required to assemble the brush together with the type of materials required to manufacture them.</p>
<p id="p-0019" num="0018">Another object of the present invention is to devise a brush for the application of fluid products, particularly for powdery, creamy, liquid products or the like, which allows overcoming the aforementioned drawbacks of the prior art within a simple, rational, easy, effective to use and affordable solution.</p>
<p id="p-0020" num="0019">The objects set out above are achieved by the present brush for the application of fluid products, particularly for powdery, creamy, liquid products or the like, having the characteristics of claim <b>1</b>.</p>

<heading id="h-0005" level="1">EMBODIMENTS OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0027" num="0026">With particular reference to these figures, reference numeral <b>1</b> globally indicates a brush for the application of fluid products, particularly for powdery, creamy, liquid products or the like.</p>
<p id="p-0028" num="0027">It is specified that preferably the brush <b>1</b> consists indistinctly of a cosmetic brush, or a fine arts brush.</p>
<p id="p-0029" num="0028">It cannot however be ruled out that the brush <b>1</b> consist of a food brush or an industrial brush.</p>
<p id="p-0030" num="0029">Furthermore, it cannot be ruled out that the brush <b>1</b> according to the present invention be used in the field of trichology, thermal treatments, body treatments, or alternatively to make a wall decoration.</p>
<p id="p-0031" num="0030">It is useful to point out that in the context of the present treatise, &#x201c;fluid product&#x201d; means any substance suitable to be taken, applied and sprinkled by means of the brush <b>1</b>, such as powders, creams and liquids in the cosmetic, artistic, food and industrial fields.</p>
<p id="p-0032" num="0031">Preferably, with reference to the preferred embodiment shown in the illustrations, the fluid product consists of a cosmetic product.</p>
<p id="p-0033" num="0032">Alternatively, the fluid product consists of a fluid product for fine arts such as tempera or watercolors.</p>
<p id="p-0034" num="0033">Again, it cannot be ruled out that the fluid product consist of a food product, paint or the like.</p>
<p id="p-0035" num="0034">The brush <b>1</b> comprises a gripping portion <b>2</b> intended to be grasped by a user's hand for the handling of the brush <b>1</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0036" num="0035">The gripping portion <b>2</b> has an elongated conformation comprising a first extremal portion <b>3</b> and a second extremal portion <b>4</b> opposite each other.</p>
<p id="p-0037" num="0036">With reference to the particular embodiment shown in the illustrations, the gripping portion <b>2</b> has a substantially conical conformation.</p>
<p id="p-0038" num="0037">However, different conformations of the gripping portion <b>2</b> cannot be ruled out such as, e.g., cylindrical, or alternatively with triangular, square or elliptical cross section.</p>
<p id="p-0039" num="0038">It should be noted that the term &#x201c;user&#x201d; relates to the person intended to use the brush <b>1</b> and, with reference to the cosmetic sector, does not necessarily coincide with the person on whom the fluid product is applied.</p>
<p id="p-0040" num="0039">By way of example, the user coincides with the person on whom the fluid product is applied.</p>
<p id="p-0041" num="0040">Furthermore, the brush <b>1</b> comprises a housing seat <b>5</b> associated with the gripping portion <b>2</b> and intended to house an application body <b>6</b> comprising, in turn, a plurality of spreading elements <b>7</b> adapted to take and apply the fluid product on a working surface.</p>
<p id="p-0042" num="0041">According to a preferred embodiment of the brush <b>1</b>, the housing seat <b>5</b> is formed on the gripping portion <b>2</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0043" num="0042">The housing seat <b>5</b> is formed at the point where one of either the first extremal portion <b>3</b> or the second extremal portion <b>4</b> is located.</p>
<p id="p-0044" num="0043">As can be seen in the figures, the housing seat <b>5</b> is formed at the point where the first extremal portion <b>3</b> is located.</p>
<p id="p-0045" num="0044">In detail, the housing seat has a substantially circular cross section.</p>
<p id="p-0046" num="0045">Preferably, the first extremal portion <b>3</b> is arranged in the proximity of the application body <b>6</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0047" num="0046">In the embodiment shown in the figures, the first extremal portion <b>3</b> is enlarged and provided with an opening defining the housing seat <b>5</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0048" num="0047">It should be noted that the housing seat <b>5</b> is made directly on the gripping portion <b>2</b> by means of machining procedures by removal of material.</p>
<p id="p-0049" num="0048">In other words, the spreading elements <b>7</b> are inserted in the housing seat <b>5</b> formed on the gripping portion <b>2</b> thus avoiding the interposition of the intermediate elements of the type of ferrules or the like.</p>
<p id="p-0050" num="0049">According to an alternative embodiment of the brush <b>1</b>, the housing seat <b>5</b> is coupled to the gripping portion <b>2</b> by interposition of a union element comprising an opening defining the housing seat <b>5</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0051" num="0050">In this case, the union element is made of a biopolymer.</p>
<p id="p-0052" num="0051">In detail, the union element has two openings opposite each other wherein one of them defines the housing seat <b>5</b> and the other is coupled to the gripping portion <b>2</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0053" num="0052">Preferably, the union element has a truncated-cone conformation with a circular cross section.</p>
<p id="p-0054" num="0053">It cannot also be ruled out that the union element have different conformations, such as e.g. a cylindrical conformation.</p>
<p id="p-0055" num="0054">At the same time, it cannot be ruled out that the union element have different cross sections, such as a quadrangular shape.</p>
<p id="p-0056" num="0055">Furthermore, it cannot be ruled out from the scope of the present disclosure that the first extremal portion <b>3</b> provided with the housing seat <b>5</b> be manufactured separately with respect to the gripping portion <b>2</b> and, in the assembly phase of the brush <b>1</b>, be associated integral with it by means of casting or welding procedures.</p>
<p id="p-0057" num="0056">According to the invention, the gripping portion <b>2</b> and the application body <b>6</b> are at least partly made of a biopolymer.</p>
<p id="p-0058" num="0057">This means that the gripping portion <b>2</b>, the application body <b>6</b> and, therefore, the spreading elements <b>7</b> are made of a biopolymer.</p>
<p id="p-0059" num="0058">It is specified that in the context of the present disclosure, the word &#x201c;biopolymer&#x201d; relates to materials directly derived from biological materials or microorganisms, or materials that can be obtained by classical chemical synthesis from renewable monomers.</p>
<p id="p-0060" num="0059">In detail, the biopolymers are selected from the list comprising:</p>
<p id="p-0061" num="0060">polymers directly extracted from natural materials, plants and animals. Examples of the type include polysaccharides such as cellulose, starch and starch mixtures, as well as proteins. Monomers in turn can be produced by fermentation of carbohydrates or sugars contained in foodstuffs;</p>
<p id="p-0062" num="0061">polymers produced by chemical synthesis, using biological and renewable monomers such as polylactic acid (e.g. PLA: bio-polyester polymerized from lactic acid monomers) or polyester;</p>
<p id="p-0063" num="0062">polymers produced by microorganisms isolated from natural or genetically modified environments such as e.g. polyhydroxyalkanoates (PHA).</p>
<p id="p-0064" num="0063">Preferably, the biopolymer is selected from the list comprising: polyolefins, polyamides, polylactic acid (PLA), polyhydroxyalkanoates (PHA), polyvinyl chloride (PVC), polyethylene terephthalate (PET), butylene adipate-coterephthalate (PBAT), polybutylene succinate (PBS), polyaprolactone (PCL), polybutylene terephthalate (PBT) or combinations thereof.</p>
<p id="p-0065" num="0064">Advantageously, the spreading elements <b>7</b> and the gripping portion <b>2</b> are made of the same material consisting of the aforementioned biopolymer.</p>
<p id="p-0066" num="0065">In other words, the brush <b>1</b> is made of one material or combination of materials. This greatly simplifies the recycling process of the brush <b>1</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0067" num="0066">In this respect, the fact of avoiding the use of ferrules and glues adapted to allow the spreading elements <b>7</b> to be fixed to the ferrule allows the brush <b>1</b> to be recycled in a single step, avoiding the disassembly thereof into single components.</p>
<p id="p-0068" num="0067">According to a first embodiment of the brush <b>1</b> according to the invention, the application body <b>6</b> is locked together with the gripping portion <b>2</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>3</b> and <b>4</b></figref>).</p>
<p id="p-0069" num="0068">It is convenient to point out that the application body <b>6</b> is associated with the gripping portion <b>2</b>, in the specific case with the housing seat <b>5</b>, thus avoiding the use of adhesive elements of the type of glue or the like.</p>
<p id="p-0070" num="0069">Preferably, the housing seat <b>5</b> has an undercut <b>8</b> configured to allow the retention of the application body <b>6</b> in the housing seat itself.</p>
<p id="p-0071" num="0070">In this regard, it is convenient to point out that the spreading elements <b>7</b> have a first end <b>9</b> associated with a supporting element <b>10</b> and a second free end <b>11</b>, opposite the first end <b>9</b> and adapted to take and apply the fluid product and wherein the supporting element <b>10</b> is configured to fit to measure into the undercut <b>8</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0072" num="0071">The supporting element <b>10</b> has a substantially circular conformation.</p>
<p id="p-0073" num="0072">In detail, the supporting element <b>10</b> has a perimeter abutment edge <b>12</b> configured to fit into the undercut <b>8</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0074" num="0073">In this regard, it should be specified that the first ends <b>9</b>, associated with the supporting element <b>10</b>, occupy a circular section of the latter which is smaller than the maximum diameter thereof. This means that the supporting element <b>10</b> has a free perimeter edge, i.e. not occupied by the spreading elements <b>7</b>, and intended to abut against the undercut <b>8</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0075" num="0074">Preferably, the spreading elements <b>7</b> are sealed to the supporting element <b>10</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0076" num="0075">Moreover, it cannot be ruled out from the present disclosure that the application body <b>6</b> and the gripping portion <b>2</b> be made in a single monolithic body.</p>
<p id="p-0077" num="0076">It cannot also be ruled out that the spreading elements <b>7</b> have the first end <b>9</b> associated with the housing seat <b>5</b> and the second free end <b>11</b>, opposite the first end <b>9</b>, protruding from the housing seat itself and adapted to take and apply the fluid product.</p>
<p id="p-0078" num="0077">This means that it cannot be ruled out that each first end <b>9</b> of the spreading elements <b>7</b> be directly associated with the bottom portion of the housing seat <b>5</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0079" num="0078">Alternatively, according to a second embodiment of the brush <b>1</b> according to the invention, the application body <b>6</b> is associated in a removable manner with the gripping portion <b>2</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0080" num="0079">In detail, the application body <b>6</b> comprises an interlocking portion <b>13</b> fittable substantially to measure by interlocking in the housing seat <b>5</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0081" num="0080">To allow the fitting to measure, the interlocking portion <b>13</b> has a conformation substantially complementary to the housing seat <b>5</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0082" num="0081">Preferably, the application body <b>6</b> is movable due to the effect of an external force applied by the user, between:</p>
<p id="p-0083" num="0082">a configuration of normal use (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>1</b> and <b>2</b></figref>) wherein the spreading elements <b>7</b> are protruding from the housing seat <b>5</b> and are intended to contact the fluid product for the application on the working surface and the interlocking portion <b>13</b> is fitted into the housing seat <b>5</b>; and</p>
<p id="p-0084" num="0083">a protection configuration (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b></figref>) wherein the spreading elements <b>7</b> are housed in the housing seat <b>5</b> and the interlocking portion <b>13</b> is protruding from the housing seat <b>5</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0085" num="0084">This way, the application body <b>6</b> can be moved between the configuration of normal use wherein the spreading elements <b>7</b>, protruding from the housing seat <b>5</b>, are available for taking and applying the fluid product and the protection configuration wherein the spreading elements <b>7</b>, being inserted in the housing seat <b>5</b>, are protected from external impacts.</p>
<p id="p-0086" num="0085">In other words, the user, by gripping the application body <b>6</b>, pulls it out of the housing seat <b>5</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0087" num="0086">Subsequently, the user, by rotating the application body <b>6</b>, by an angle substantially equal to 180&#xb0;, inserts it inside the housing seat <b>5</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0088" num="0087">More specifically, the application body <b>6</b> has a conformation substantially complementary to the housing seat <b>5</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0089" num="0088">As can be seen in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b></figref>, the interlocking portion <b>13</b> has a decorative element <b>14</b> intended, in the protection configuration, to protrude overhanging from the housing seat <b>5</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0090" num="0089">For example, the decorative element <b>14</b> is of the type of a logo.</p>
<p id="p-0091" num="0090">Alternatively, the decorative element <b>14</b> has an annular conformation adapted to allow the brush <b>1</b> to be fastened to a supporting element.</p>
<p id="p-0092" num="0091">It is useful to point out that the fact of envisaging the application body <b>6</b> associated in a removable manner with the housing seat <b>5</b> also allows the gripping portion <b>2</b> to be combined with a plurality of application bodies <b>6</b> having different shapes.</p>
<p id="p-0093" num="0092">For example, the application body <b>6</b> may be removed from the housing seat <b>5</b> and an additional application body <b>6</b> associated with it.</p>
<p id="p-0094" num="0093">Advantageously, interlocking means, not shown in detail in the illustrations, are obtained on the housing seat <b>5</b> and on the interlocking portion <b>13</b> respectively, and configured to allow the fitting of the application body <b>6</b> by interlocking to the housing seat itself.</p>
<p id="p-0095" num="0094">For example, the interlocking means comprise at least one housing recess formed on one of either the interlocking portion <b>13</b> or the housing seat <b>5</b> and at least one interlocking tooth made on the other of either the housing seat <b>5</b> or the interlocking portion <b>13</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0096" num="0095">Preferably, the interlocking tooth is made on the interlocking portion <b>13</b> and the housing recess is made on the housing seat <b>5</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0097" num="0096">It cannot be ruled out from the scope of the present disclosure that the interlocking means comprise two, three, four, etc. interlocking teeth and two, three, four, etc. interlocking recesses.</p>
<p id="p-0098" num="0097">Alternatively, the interlocking means comprise an annular-shaped abutment element made at the median portion of the application body <b>6</b> and which can be inserted to measure into the housing recess. This way, both in the configuration of normal use and in the protection configuration, the interlocking means allow the temporary association of the application body <b>6</b> with the housing seat <b>5</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0099" num="0098">The disengagement of the teeth, or of the abutment element, from the housing recess is achieved by exploiting the deformability of the walls of the housing seat <b>5</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0100" num="0099">The operation of the present invention is as follows.</p>
<p id="p-0101" num="0100">Through the gripping portion <b>2</b>, the brush <b>1</b> is maneuvered and moved closer to the fluid product, for example a cosmetic product to be taken, placing the application body <b>6</b>, i.e. the plurality of spreading elements <b>7</b>, in contact with the fluid product itself so as to be able to capture the desired amount of product.</p>
<p id="p-0102" num="0101">According to the first embodiment of the brush <b>1</b>, the user moves the second ends <b>11</b> of the spreading elements <b>7</b> closer to the working surface by placing them in contact therewith and, by moving the brush <b>1</b>, allows the fluid product to be spread.</p>
<p id="p-0103" num="0102">At the same time, according to the second embodiment of the brush <b>1</b>, the user prepares the application body <b>6</b> in the configuration of normal use (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>1</b> and <b>2</b></figref>) with the spreading elements <b>7</b> available for taking and applying the fluid product.</p>
<p id="p-0104" num="0103">After finishing using the brush <b>1</b>, the user grips the application body <b>6</b> and pulls it out of the housing seat <b>5</b>, taking advantage of the partial deformability of the latter, which allows the teeth, or the abutment element, to be disengaged from the housing recess.</p>
<p id="p-0105" num="0104">At this point, by rotating the application body <b>6</b> by an angle substantially equal to 180&#xb0;, the user inserts the spreading elements <b>7</b> inside the housing seat <b>5</b>, by placing the interlocking portion <b>13</b> outside the housing seat itself.</p>
<p id="p-0106" num="0105">In the same way as the configuration of normal use, in the protection configuration as well, by taking advantage of the partial deformability of the housing seat <b>5</b>, the teeth or the abutment element engage with and insert themselves in the housing recess.</p>
<p id="p-0107" num="0106">It has in practice been ascertained that the described invention achieves the intended objects.</p>
<p id="p-0108" num="0107">The fact is underlined that the particular solution of having the spreading elements, the gripping portion, the housing seat and the supporting element made of a single material allows considerably simplifying the process of recycling the brush.</p>
<p id="p-0109" num="0108">Furthermore, the particular solution of providing the application body directly associated with the housing seat, thus avoiding the use of intermediate elements such as ferrules or the like, allows considerably increasing the resistance of the brush to wear and external impacts.</p>
<p id="p-0110" num="0109">To this must be added the fact that by making the application body removably associated with the housing seat, the spreading elements can be kept arranged inside the housing seat after the brush has been used.</p>
