<heading id="h-0002" level="1">FIELD OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">The invention relates to an electronic cigarette for providing a vapour. The vapour can be inhaled by a person.</p>
<heading id="h-0003" level="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">The known electronic cigarette comprises a housing having a liquid section and a battery section, and a wick and heating member located in the housing. The electrical wires are attached to the heating member to provide electrical power from the battery. A disadvantage of the known electronic cigarette is that it is difficult to produce, especially to produce it mechanically.</p>
<heading id="h-0004" level="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">The invention has the objective to provide an improved, or at least alternative, e-cigarette. According to one aspect according to the invention, the object is to provide an e-cigarette which can be produced in a more efficient manner. According to a further aspect according to the invention, the object is to provide an e-cigarette which is can be produced mechanically.</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">The e-cigarette according the invention comprises a housing having a liquid section for holding a liquid and a battery section for holding a battery, which liquid section and battery section are configured to be coupled to each other, a wick to take up the liquid, and a heating member for heating the wick, wherein the liquid section comprises a liquid reservoir provided with a liquid outlet to supply liquid to the wick and an air duct to create an air flow along the wick and to an air outlet, the heating member and the wick are combined to form a combined construction having an outer surface which is at least partly electrically conductive, and the e-cigarette comprises a first electrical contact member being electrically connected to an anode of the battery and a second electrical contact member being electrically connected to a cathode of the battery, which first and second electrical contact members are in contact with conductive parts of the outer surface of the combined construction without being attached to them.</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">Since the wick and the heating member form a combined construction, they can be supplied during the production process in a single processing step. In the known e-cigarette, the wick and the heating member are each supplied in a separate processing step. This allows that the e-cigarette according to the invention can be produced in a more efficient manner. It especially allows that the production process can be performed mechanically.</p>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">The e-cigarette further allows that the battery is electrically connected to the combined construction of the wick and heating member without being attached to it (via for example welded electrical wires). The process of electrically attaching elements is difficult to perform, especially to perform it mechanically. The fact that in the e-cigarette according to the invention the combined construction is electrically connected to the first and second electrical contact members without being attached to them, allows that the e-cigarette can be produced in a more simple manner. Due to this, the e-cigarette can be produced in a cost efficient manner by machines instead of by the hands of a person.</p>
<p id="p-0009" num="0008">In an embodiment of the e-cigarette, the combined construction is free from protruding parts extending away from the outer surface.</p>
<p id="p-0010" num="0009">In an embodiment of the e-cigarette, the entire combined construction extends along a straight line or a substantially straight line. The fact that the entire combined construction extends along a straight line increases the handling possibilities of the combined construction and allows that the e-cigarette is produced mechanically.</p>
<p id="p-0011" num="0010">In an embodiment of the e-cigarette, the combined construction is free from protruding parts extending transverse to the straight line.</p>
<p id="p-0012" num="0011">In an embodiment of the e-cigarette, the combined construction has an elongate form extending along its longitudinal axis.</p>
<p id="p-0013" num="0012">In an embodiment of the e-cigarette, the combined construction has such a rigidity that it maintains its form when subjected to gravity.</p>
<p id="p-0014" num="0013">In an embodiment of the e-cigarette, the combined construction has such a rigidity that it maintains its form when handled mechanically, such as during mechanical pick and place operations.</p>
<p id="p-0015" num="0014">In an embodiment of the e-cigarette, the combined construction has a cross section perpendicular to the longitudinal axis, which cross section is constant along the longitudinal axis. The cross section can have the form of a circle, a square, a rectangle, or a polygon.</p>
<p id="p-0016" num="0015">In an embodiment of the e-cigarette, the first and second electrical contact members are located at a distance from each other along the longitudinal axis of the combined construction.</p>
<p id="p-0017" num="0016">In an embodiment of the e-cigarette, the combined construction is located between a first support member and an opposite second support member to hold the combined construction in a fixed position.</p>
<p id="p-0018" num="0017">In an embodiment of the e-cigarette, the first and second electrical contact members are provided on the first support member. The second support member may comprise a first electrically conductive member located opposite to the first electrical contact member and a second electrically conductive member located opposite to the second electrical contact member.</p>
<p id="p-0019" num="0018">In an embodiment of the e-cigarette, the first and second electrical contact members are provided on the second support member. The first support member may comprise a first electrically conductive member located opposite to the first electrical contact member and a second electrically conductive member located opposite to the second electrical contact member.</p>
<p id="p-0020" num="0019">In an embodiment of the e-cigarette, the combined construction is in contact with the first and second support member without being attached to them.</p>
<p id="p-0021" num="0020">In an embodiment of the e-cigarette, the combined construction is free from any attached contact with the e-cigarette. The combined construction may only have contact with the liquid section without being attached to it, or the battery section without being attached to it, or the liquid section and the battery section without being attached to them.</p>
<p id="p-0022" num="0021">In an embodiment of the e-cigarette, the wick of the combined construction is formed by a ceramic material. The ceramic material may have a porous structure.</p>
<p id="p-0023" num="0022">In an embodiment of the e-cigarette, the wick of the combined construction is formed by a fibrous material. The fibrous material may be a fibre rope.</p>
<p id="p-0024" num="0023">In an embodiment of the e-cigarette, the heating member of the combined construction is formed by an electrically conductive wire.</p>

<heading id="h-0006" level="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS</heading>
<p id="p-0066" num="0065">The <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>1</b>-<b>4</b></figref> show a first embodiment of the e-cigarette <b>1</b> according to the invention. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>1</b> and <b>4</b></figref> show a view in perspective of the e-cigarette <b>1</b> and the <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>2</b> and <b>3</b></figref> show a view in cross section.</p>
<p id="p-0067" num="0066">The e-cigarette <b>1</b> comprises a housing <b>2</b> having a liquid section <b>3</b> for holding a liquid and a battery section <b>4</b> for holding a battery <b>5</b>. The liquid section <b>3</b> and the battery section <b>4</b> are configured to be coupled to each other via a first section coupling member <b>26</b> provided on the liquid section <b>3</b> a second section coupling member <b>27</b> provided on the battery section <b>4</b>. The wick <b>6</b> for taking up the liquid and the heating member <b>7</b> for heating the wick are combined to form a combined construction <b>12</b> having an outer surface <b>13</b> which is at least partly electrically conductive. This is further discussed in detail with respect to the <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>11</b> and <b>12</b></figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0068" num="0067">The liquid section <b>3</b> comprises a liquid reservoir <b>8</b> provided with a liquid outlet <b>9</b>A to supply liquid to the wick <b>6</b> and an air duct <b>10</b> to create an air flow along the wick <b>6</b> and to an air outlet <b>11</b>. The e-cigarette <b>1</b> comprises a first electrical contact member <b>14</b> being electrically connected to an anode of the battery <b>5</b> and a second electrical contact member <b>15</b> being electrically connected to a cathode of the battery <b>5</b>. The first and second electrical contact members <b>14</b>, <b>15</b> are in contact with conductive parts <b>18</b>A, <b>18</b>B of the outer surface <b>13</b> of the combined construction <b>12</b> without being attached to them.</p>
<p id="p-0069" num="0068">The e-cigarette <b>1</b> comprises an airflow sensor <b>28</b> which controls a switch <b>30</b> in order to close an electrical circuit <b>29</b> which connects the first and second electrical contact members <b>14</b>, <b>15</b> to the anode and cathode of the battery <b>5</b> when an airflow is detected and to open the electrical circuit <b>29</b> when no airflow is detected. The airflow is indicated by arrows.</p>
<p id="p-0070" num="0069">Since the wick <b>6</b> and the heating member <b>7</b> form a combined construction <b>12</b>, they can be supplied during the production process in a single processing step. In the known e-cigarette, the wick and the heating member are each supplied in a separate processing step. This allows that the e-cigarette <b>1</b> according to the invention can be produced in a more efficient manner. It especially allows that the production process can be performed mechanically.</p>
<p id="p-0071" num="0070">The e-cigarette <b>1</b> further allows that the battery <b>5</b> is electrically connected to the combined construction <b>12</b> of the wick <b>6</b> and heating member <b>7</b> without being attached to it (via for example welded electrical wires). The process of electrically attaching elements is difficult to perform, especially to perform it mechanically. The fact that in the e-cigarette <b>1</b> according to the invention the combined construction <b>12</b> is electrically connected to the first and second electrical contact members <b>14</b>, <b>15</b> without being attached to them, allows that the e-cigarette <b>1</b> can be produced in a more simple manner. Due to this, the e-cigarette <b>1</b> can be produced in a cost efficient manner by machines instead of by the hands of a person.</p>
<p id="p-0072" num="0071">The <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b>-<b>7</b></figref> shows enlarged views of the liquid section <b>3</b> of the e-cigarette <b>1</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0073" num="0072">The entire combined construction <b>12</b> extends along a substantially straight line. The combined construction <b>12</b> has an elongate form extending along its longitudinal axis <b>20</b>. The combined construction <b>12</b> has such a rigidity that it maintains its form when subjected to gravity. Each of these characteristics allows that the combined construction <b>12</b> can be mechanically handled.</p>
<p id="p-0074" num="0073">In the known e-cigarette, the wick is in general very flexible and does not maintain its form when subjected to gravity or does not maintain its form when handled mechanically, such as during mechanical pick and place operations. It is therefore very difficult to mechanically handle the known wick. The known wick in general also extend in different directions. The known wicks have a first part which extend inside the liquid reservoir and a second part which extends in a different direction along the heading member. Since the known wick extends in different directions, it is difficult to handle it mechanically, such as for mechanical pick and place operations.</p>
<p id="p-0075" num="0074">The combined construction <b>12</b> is located between a first support member <b>21</b> and an opposite second support member <b>22</b> to hold the combined construction <b>12</b> in a fixed position <b>23</b>. This ensures that there is a continuous contact between the combined construction <b>12</b> and the first and second electrical contact members <b>14</b>, <b>15</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0076" num="0075">The first and second electrical contact members <b>14</b>, <b>15</b> are provided on the second support member <b>22</b>. The first support member <b>21</b> comprises a first electrically conductive member <b>47</b> located opposite to the first electrical contact member <b>14</b> and a second electrically conductive member <b>48</b> located opposite to the second electrical contact member <b>15</b>. The first and second electrically conductive members <b>47</b>, <b>48</b> enhance the performance of the e-cigarette <b>1</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0077" num="0076">The combined construction <b>12</b> is in contact with the first and second support member <b>21</b>, <b>22</b> without being attached to them. The combined construction <b>12</b> is free from any attached contact with the e-cigarette <b>1</b>. This allows that the e-cigarette <b>1</b> can be produced mechanically in an efficient manner.</p>
<p id="p-0078" num="0077">The first and second electrical contact members <b>14</b>, <b>15</b> are located at a distance D from each other along the longitudinal axis <b>20</b> of the combined construction <b>12</b> (see also <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>10</b></figref>). This ensures that an electrical current can flow through the combined construction<b>12</b>.</p>

The first and second contact members <b>14</b>, <b>15</b> are provided on the second liquid part <b>32</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0081" num="0080">The second liquid part <b>32</b> comprises a third electrical contact member <b>36</b> being electrically connected to the first electrical contact member <b>14</b> and a fourth electrical contact member <b>37</b> being electrically connected to the second electrical contact member <b>15</b>, which third and fourth electrical contact member <b>36</b>, <b>37</b> are configured to become electrically connected with the battery <b>5</b> when the battery section <b>4</b> is coupled to the liquid section <b>3</b>.</p>
