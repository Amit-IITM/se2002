<p id="p-0001" num="0000">Disclosed are plant protein compositions prepared from hemp plant material. Hemp seeds are deconstructed and separated into heavy protein-rich fractions and light oil-rich fractions. The deconstruction processes avoid the use of organic solvents and temperatures above 60&#xb0; C. The separated fractions are then selectively processed to produce selected plant protein containing compositions comprising from about 30% (w/w) to about 95% hemp protein, from about 5% (w/w) and to about 60% (w/w) plant oil. The plant protein compositions from hemp plants are suitable for use as ingredients in nutritional formulations.</p>

<heading id="h-0001" level="1">FIELD OF THE DISCLOSURE</heading>
<p id="p-0002" num="0001">The present disclosure generally relates to protein compositions. More specifically, this disclosure pertains to protein compositions recoverable from plant components.</p>
<heading id="h-0002" level="1">BACKGROUND</heading>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">Plant materials are known to be excellent sources of edible oils and proteins. For example, edible oils are commonly produced by pressing under high pressures, seeds harvested from agricultural crops such as <i>Brassica </i>spp., corn, soybeans, peanuts, sunflower, safflower, hemp, flax, legumes, and cotton, among others.</p>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">Plant materials with a high oil content (e.g. 35% or more) are typically processed with techniques that have evolved to optimize plant oil yield. In general, these processing techniques involve combinations of mechanical pressing and solvent extraction of selected plant material. After the oil is extracted, the remaining oilseed cake or meal may be used to extract plant proteins as a co-product. Protein extraction processes commonly involve heat treatment to remove extraction solvents from the oilseed cake or meal. However, due to the harsh processing conditions employed, the plant proteins recovered from oilseed cake or meal generally lose their native conformational state and form denatured or fractured structures. Preparations consisting primarily of denatured proteins are less suitable as a nutritional ingredient, since properties such as solubility, flavor, smell and color are generally all negatively impacted by the processing conditions.</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">Thus, it is clear that while plant materials represent a valuable source of proteins, the quality of protein preparations obtained from these plant materials known to the art is suboptimal.</p>
<heading id="h-0003" level="1">SUMMARY</heading>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">The embodiments of the present disclosure generally relate to protein preparations produced from selected hemp plant materials. According to one aspect, the selected hemp plant materials may be hemp seeds.</p>

<p id="p-0074" num="0130">Accordingly, another embodiment according to the present disclosure pertains to methods and processes for producing the disclosed hemp plant protein compositions, wherein the methods and processes generally comprise the steps of deconstructing whole seeds of selected plants with a selected comminuting process to produce comminuted mixtures comprising heavy high-protein fractions and light high-oil fractions, separating the heavy high-protein fractions from the light high-oil fractions, and then separately further processing the heavy high-protein fractions and/or the light high-oil fractions to produce the plant protein compositions.

<p id="p-0075" num="0131">Various suitable techniques and methods for processing seed materials from hemp plant material to produce therefrom the present plant protein concentrates are disclosed in the following sections. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>2</b>A-<b>2</b>B</figref>, and <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>3</b>A-<b>3</b>C</figref> illustrate schematic diagrams of example processes <b>100</b>, <b>200</b>, and <b>300</b> wherein hemp seeds are selected and used as the starting plant materials for preparing hemp protein compositions in accordance with some embodiments of the present disclosure. Notably, process <b>100</b> illustrates a schematic diagram of a process for preparing protein-lipid complex containing mixtures, process <b>200</b> illustrates schematic diagrams for preparing protein concentrates and protein-lipid complex containing mixtures, and process <b>300</b> illustrates schematic diagrams for preparing protein concentrates and protein isolates</p>
<p id="p-0076" num="0132">Thus, referring now to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>, example process <b>100</b> starts with providing a quantity of hemp seeds. Hemp seeds <b>111</b> may be obtained for example, by agriculturally producing and harvesting seed, and/or by purchasing seed from a commercial seed supplier. Prior to proceeding with the comminuting step <b>120</b>, the hemp seeds <b>111</b> may optionally be screened and cleaned if necessary or so desired, to remove extraneous materials such as debris or non-intact seed material. Hemp seeds <b>111</b> may also optionally be washed or surface sterilized using, for example, a chemical agent such as bleach, to reduce contaminating biological agents such as bacteria or fungi that may be present on the seed coats. In some embodiments, undesirable seed parts may be removed for example, the seed coating, the hull, or the husk may be removed using for example, dehulling equipment with which those of skill in this art will generally be familiar. Furthermore, hemp seeds <b>111</b> may be soaked for a selected period of time for example, from about 30 minutes to about 24 hours, for example, for at least 6 hours in water.</p>
<p id="p-0077" num="0133">Continuing in reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>, example process <b>100</b> further comprises comminuting step <b>120</b> wherein dehulled hemp seeds <b>111</b> are comminuted whereby is produced a comminuted mixture of seed particles <b>121</b>, preferably having particle sizes in a range of between about 5 &#x3bc;m and about 200 &#x3bc;m. Comminuting step <b>120</b> generally reduces the seed volume as well as the particle size of the comminuted seed. Step <b>120</b> may be carried out by conveying of dehulled hemp seeds <b>111</b> into comminuting equipment such as a seed mill, a colloid mill, a hammer mill, a blade mill, a roller mill, and the like. In other embodiments, a homogenizer such as a high-pressure homogenizer, may be used to comminute of dehulled hemp seed <b>111</b>. In yet other embodiments, a sequential combination of a mill and a homogenizer or other such equipment may be used to comminute the seed <b>111</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0078" num="0134">It should be further noted that the selection of the specific comminuting equipment and the operating conditions of the equipment may depend on the size of the selected hemp seed <b>111</b>. However, regardless of the comminuting equipment that is selected, upon completion of step <b>120</b>, the comminuted seed particle mixture <b>121</b> will have mean particle sizes in a range of from about 5 &#x3bc;m to about 200 &#x3bc;m or from about 5 &#x3bc;m to about 100 &#x3bc;m, or mean particle sizes in a range of about 10 &#x3bc;m, about 25 &#x3bc;m, about 50 &#x3bc;m, about 100 &#x3bc;m, about 125 &#x3bc;m, about 150 &#x3bc;m, about 175 &#x3bc;m, about 200 &#x3bc;m, and therebetween. Preferably, the comminution equipment and conditions are selected so that the comminuted hemp seed particles are homogenously sized, i.e. the particles can have tightly-centered mean-particle size, e.g. at least 90% of the particles can have a size not exceeding &#xb1;20% of the particle size, or not exceeding &#xb1;10% of the particle size, or not exceeding &#xb1;5% of the mean particle size. Furthermore, it should be noted that high temperatures i.e. temperatures in excess of 60&#xb0; C. are avoided in the performance of comminuting step <b>121</b>. Thus, comminuting step <b>121</b> may be conducted at ambient temperatures although it is understood that during operation of mechanical comminution equipment, the temperature of the seed mixture may increase above the ambient temperatures.</p>
<p id="p-0079" num="0135">Comminuting step <b>121</b> may be carried out with the hemp seed <b>111</b> suspended in an aqueous solution. Examples of suitable aqueous solutions include water and dilute solutions comprising a sodium salt solution such as NaCl or Na<sub>2</sub>SO<sub>4</sub>. Examples of suitable dilute solutions may comprise about 50 mM of a sodium salt and/or about 50 mM of a strong acid. The aqueous solution may be added to the hemp seed <b>111</b> prior to conveyance into the comminuting equipment, or alternatively, while the hemp seed <b>111</b> is being discharged from a seed bin or other seed storage containers into the comminuting equipment. As hereinbefore noted, the use of organic solvents during performance of the comminuting step <b>121</b> is avoided.</p>
<p id="p-0080" num="0136">Continuing in reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>, example process <b>100</b> may further comprise a separation step <b>130</b> during which the comminuted seed particle mixture is separated into a solid phase <b>131</b> and a liquid phase <b>132</b>. Thus, separation step <b>130</b> yields two seed fractions. The separation step <b>130</b> may be carried out by conveying the comminuted seed particle mixture <b>121</b> into equipment suitable for separating the comminuted seed particle mixture <b>121</b> based on density differentials. Suitable separation equipment includes, for example, a centrifuge such as a two-phase decanter operated at modest gravitational forces to separate a light liquid phase <b>132</b> and a heavy solid phase <b>131</b> containing seed particle solids. The liquid phase <b>132</b> recovered after separation therefrom of the heavy solid phase <b>131</b>, contains the majority of the seed oil, and the separated solid phase <b>131</b> contains solid seed particulate material including for example, seed hull particles.</p>
<p id="p-0081" num="0137">The recovered solid phase <b>131</b> may have a dry-basis composition of about 8.3% (w/w) oil and 26.2% (w/w) protein (N&#xd7;6.25).</p>
<p id="p-0082" num="0138">Continuing in reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>, example process <b>100</b> may further comprise step <b>140</b> during which liquid phase <b>132</b> is separated into an oleosome containing light liquid phase <b>141</b> and a protein containing heavy liquid phase <b>142</b>. Step <b>140</b> may be achieved by conveying the liquid phase <b>132</b> into separation equipment capable of further separating the liquid phase <b>132</b> based on density differential.</p>
<p id="p-0083" num="0139">It should be noted that steps <b>130</b> and <b>140</b> may be performed concurrently by using a single-density differential-based separation equipment such as a 3-phase decanter capable of separating the comminuted seed particle mixture into a solid phase, a heavy liquid phase, and a light liquid phase.</p>

<p id="p-0085" num="0141">Continuing in reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>, example process <b>100</b> may further comprise step <b>160</b> comprising subjecting permeate <b>151</b> to ultrafiltration treatment to obtain retentate <b>161</b>.

<p id="p-0086" num="0142">Continuing in reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>, example process <b>100</b> may further comprise step <b>170</b> comprising drying retentate <b>161</b>, to obtain first protein-lipid complex containing mixture concentrate <b>171</b>. In general, the moisture content of the retentate <b>161</b> may be modulated by controlling the drying process, for example, by extending or decreasing the drying time and/or by increasing or decreasing the drying temperature. In this manner, a substantially dry first protein-lipid complex containing mixture <b>171</b> may be obtained. First protein-lipid complex containing mixture <b>171</b> may have from about 47% (w/w) to about 51% hemp protein (N&#xd7;6.25), from about 32% (w/w) to about 36% (w/w) plant oil, and from about 3.4 (w/w) and to about 3.8% (w/w) carbohydrates.

First solid extract <b>321</b> may be separated (step <b>325</b>) into second solid phase <b>326</b> and second liquid phase <b>327</b>, by subjecting first solid phase extract <b>325</b> to centrifugation. Second solid phase <b>326</b> may, for example, have a moisture content of 60.9% and a dry-basis composition: 1.6% (w/w) oil, 15.7% (w/w) protein (N&#xd7;6.25), 6.9% (w/w) ash and 75.8% (w/w) carbohydrate. Second liquid phase <b>327</b> may, for example, have a moisture content of 95.7% and a dry-basis composition: 8.5% (w/w) oil, 90.7% (w/w) protein (N&#xd7;6.25), 5.4% (w/w) ash and no detected carbohydrate.</p>
<p id="p-0092" num="0148">Next, the second liquid phase may be processed according to a first example sub-process <b>300</b><i>a </i>of example process <b>300</b> shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b>B</figref> or according to a second example sub-process <b>300</b><i>b </i>of example process <b>300</b> shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b>C</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0093" num="0149">Referring, now to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b>B</figref>, Next, step <b>330</b> of first example sub-process <b>300</b><i>a </i>of example process <b>300</b> may comprise settling second liquid phase <b>327</b> and obtaining a light oil-rich phase <b>332</b> and a heavy second liquid phase <b>331</b>. This may be accomplished by gravitational settling, for example in a settling tank, wherein oil-rich phase <b>332</b> and heavy second liquid phase <b>331</b> may be formed. By gradual draining of the fluid from the bottom of the settling tank heavy second liquid phase <b>331</b> may be obtained. Next, heavy second liquid phase <b>331</b> may be precipitated (step <b>335</b>) to obtain protein precipitate <b>336</b>. This may be accomplished by acidifying the protein-containing heavy second liquid phase <b>331</b> and adjusting the pH to pH in the acidic pH range. The acid-precipitated protein may be recovered in the form of a protein precipitate <b>336</b> using density-differential based separation equipment. In order to obtain protein concentrate <b>341</b>, protein precipitate <b>336</b> may be dried (step <b>340</b>). Protein concentrate <b>341</b> may have a protein content (N&#xd7;6.25) of, for example, 95% (on a dry matter basis) (from about 84% to about 87% protein on an as-is basis), from about 11% to about 18% plant oil (on a dry matter basis), from about 2% to about 3% ash (on a dry matter basis), and from about 3% to about 9% moisture. The total oil and protein (N&#xd7;6.25) in protein concentrate <b>341</b> may comprise a total from about 97.9% to about 103% of the material, and may comprise a protein (N&#xd7;6.25) to oil ratio of about 4.5:1 to about 7.9:1. Furthermore, protein concentrate <b>341</b> may have an essential amino acid content of about 26.5% to about 28% (on an as-is percentage basis), and about 31 to about 33% (as a percentage of crude protein). Furthermore, the percentage solubility of protein concentrate <b>341</b> may be between about 57% and about 62% at pH 2, between about 53% and about 64% at pH 3, between 49% and about 51% at pH 4, between about 39% and about 46% at pH 5, between about 1% and about 2% at pH 6, and between about 30% and 35% at pH 7. Furthermore, the oil-holding capacity of protein concentrate <b>341</b> may be from about 0.8 to about 1.2 g oil/g of protein, and the water-hydration capacity may be from about 1.5 to about 1.8 g water/g of protein. Furthermore, the emulsion stability of protein concentrate <b>341</b> may be between 53% and 56%. Furthermore, the foaming capacity of protein concentrate <b>341</b> may be about 15% and the foaming stability may range from about 92% to about 100%. Furthermore, protein concentrate <b>341</b> may have the following colorimetric characteristics: a lightness value L* of between about 60% and about 63%, a red/green tone value a* of between about 0.7 and about 0.8, and a yellow/blue tone value b* of between about 9 and about 13.</p>
<p id="p-0094" num="0150">Thus, starting with liquid phase <b>327</b>, the performance of example sub-process <b>300</b><i>a </i>of example process <b>300</b> may yield second protein concentrate <b>341</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0095" num="0151">Referring next to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b>C</figref>, shown therein is a second example sub-process <b>300</b><i>b </i>of example process <b>300</b>.

Example sub-process <b>300</b><i>b </i>may further comprise step <b>345</b> comprising precipitating second liquid phase <b>327</b> to obtain protein precipitate <b>346</b>. This may be achieved by acidifying second liquid phase <b>327</b> and adjusting the pH to a pH in the acidic pH range. The acid-precipitated protein may be recovered therefrom in the form of a protein precipitate <b>346</b> using density differential-based separation equipment. In order to obtain protein isolate <b>351</b>, protein precipitate <b>346</b> may be dried (step <b>350</b>). Protein isolate <b>351</b> may, for example, have a protein content (N&#xd7;6.25) of, for example, from about 94% (w/w) to about 98% (w/w), and from about 5% to about 8% of plant oil. Protein isolate <b>351</b> may, for example, have a protein content (N&#xd7;6.25) of, for example, 95.5% (on a dry matter basis) (93.1% protein on an as-is basis), 6.6% plant oil (on an as-is basis), 4.3% ash (on an as-is basis), and 2.6% moisture. The total oil and protein (N&#xd7;6.25) in protein isolate <b>351</b> may comprise a total 99.62% of the material, in a protein (N&#xd7;6.25) to oil ratio of 14.2:1 Thus, starting with liquid phase <b>327</b>, the performance of example sub-process <b>300</b><i>b </i>of example process <b>300</b> may yield protein isolate <b>351</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0096" num="0152">To briefly recap, the example processes <b>100</b>, <b>200</b>, and <b>300</b> may each provide selectable protein precipitates which may be selectively dried to form prepared protein concentrates.

The homogenized slurry (i.e. comminuted seed mixture <b>121</b>) was immediately fed into a centrifuge decanter with sufficient force on the slurry to enable separation of solid phase <b>131</b> and liquid phase <b>132</b>.

<p id="p-0136" num="0192">This example refers to process <b>200</b> depicted in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref>. Clean (&#x3c;1% dockage) <i>Cannabis Sativa </i>L. seeds <b>206</b> (29.3% oil content, 24.9% protein content) were washed. The clean seeds were fed by an auger hammer mill and combined with reverse osmosis water to produce a wet-milled aqueous slurry of seed. The slurry underwent immediate particle size reduction by processing through a mill. The pH of the final homogenized slurry (i.e. comminuted seed mixture <b>211</b>) was adjusted to 10, which was then fed into a centrifuge decanter with sufficient force on the slurry to enable separation of solid phase <b>216</b> and liquid phase <b>217</b>. Solid phase <b>216</b> is the first co-product of process <b>200</b> and the corresponding decanter liquid phase <b>217</b> (671.9 kg), comprising a mixture of liquefied seed components, was separated in a separator. The resulting oleosome-containing light liquid phase <b>221</b> serves to direct the majority of the seed oil (&#x3e;65%) away from the production pathway for protein in order to facilitate low-fat protein concentrates. To that end, the pH of corresponding heavy liquid phase <b>222</b> (515.5 kg) was adjusted to 5.5 and the resulting mixture was separated in a clarifier centrifuge. A sample of resulting pellet precipitate <b>226</b> (84.7 kg) was dried to produce a first protein concentrate <b>231</b> from example process <b>200</b> with the composition shown in Table 4 and an amino acid composition shown in Table 5.</p>

The corresponding decanter liquid phase <b>317</b> served to direct the majority of the seed oil (&#x3e;80%) away from the protein production pathway. The solid phase <b>316</b> was combined with RO-water in a holding tank while maintaining constant mixing of the contents. The pH of the solid phase slurry was adjusted to 10. Following extraction, the solid phase extract <b>321</b> was fed into a centrifuge decanter with sufficient force on the solid phase extract <b>321</b> to separate a second solid phase <b>326</b> and a second liquid phase <b>327</b>. The second solid phase <b>326</b> had a moisture content of 60.9% and a dry-basis composition: 1.6% (w/w) oil, 15.7% (w/w) protein, 6.9% (w/w) ash and 75.8% (w/w) carbohydrate. The second liquid phase <b>327</b> (217.0 kg) had a moisture content of 95.7% and a dry-basis composition: 8.5% (w/w) oil, 90.7% (w/w) protein, 5.4% (w/w) ash and no detected carbohydrate.</p>
<p id="p-0146" num="0198">The second liquid phase <b>327</b> was then allowed to stand and settle under gravity in a tank for 82 mins, to allow for any oil-rich phase to separate out to the top. The bottom 75% of the tank contents were drained and collected to produce the heavy second liquid phase <b>331</b>. The pH of the heavy second liquid phase <b>331</b> was adjusted to 5.0 and the resulting mixture was separated in a clarifier centrifuge. A sample of the resulting pellet or protein precipitate <b>336</b> was dried to produce a second protein concentrate <b>341</b> from example process <b>300</b> and subprocess <b>300</b><i>a </i>with the composition shown in Table 8 and an amino acid composition shown in Table 9. The total oil and protein in second protein concentrate <b>341</b> comprised a total 97.9% of the material, in a protein to oil ratio of 7.9:1.</p>

<heading id="h-0013" level="1">Example 7&#x2014;Preparation of a Hemp Protein Isolate</heading>
<p id="p-0158" num="0204">This example refers to process <b>300</b> and subprocess <b>300</b><i>b </i>depicted in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b>A</figref> and <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b>C</figref>. <i>Cannabis sativa </i>seeds <b>306</b> (29.3% oil content, 24.9% protein) were washed. The washed seeds were fed by an auger to a mill and combined with reverse osmosis water to produce a wet-milled aqueous slurry of seed. The resulting slurry underwent immediate and continuous particle size reduction by processing with homogenizers. The homogenized slurry (i.e. comminuted seed mixture <b>311</b>) was immediately fed into a centrifuge decanter with sufficient force to enable separation of solid phase <b>316</b> and liquid phase <b>317</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0159" num="0205">Solid phase <b>316</b> had a moisture content of 50.8% and a dry-basis composition: 4.5% (w/w) oil, 36.6% (w/w) protein, 6.4% (w/w) ash and 52.6% (w/w) carbohydrate. The corresponding decanter liquid phase <b>317</b> comprising a mixture of liquefied seed components, served to direct the majority of the seed oil (&#x3e;85%) away from the protein production pathway. The solid phase <b>320</b> was combined in a holding tank while maintaining constant mixing of the contents. The pH of the solid phase slurry was adjusted. Following extraction, the solid phase extract <b>321</b> was fed into a centrifuge decanter with sufficient force on the solid phase extract <b>321</b> to separate a second solid phase <b>326</b> and a second liquid phase <b>327</b>. Separation of the slurry in the decanter occurred in 28 minutes. The second solid phase <b>326</b> (69.8 kg) had a moisture content of 60.4% and a dry-basis composition: 2.6% (w/w) oil, 15.0% (w/w) protein, 8.1% (w/w) ash and 74.4% (w/w) carbohydrate. The second liquid phase <b>327</b> (337.1 kg) had a moisture content of 96.5% and a dry-basis composition: 9.7% (w/w) oil, 90.6% (w/w) protein, 6.9% (w/w) ash and no detected carbohydrate.</p>
<p id="p-0160" num="0206">The pH of the second liquid phase <b>327</b> was reduced to 5.0 and the resulting mixture was separated in a clarifier centrifuge. A sample of the resulting pellet or protein precipitate <b>346</b> was dried to produce a first protein isolate <b>351</b> from example process <b>300</b> and subprocess <b>300</b><i>b </i>with the composition shown in Table 14.</p>

<p id="p-0163" num="0208">This example illustrates the protein solubility of the hemp protein products prepared according to the present invention as described in Examples 2, 4 and 5. Protein solubility was tested by a modified version of the procedure of Morr et al., 1985, J. Food Sci., 50: 1715-1718. 2.0 g of protein powder were dispersed in 200 mL of reverse osmosis (RO) water after which, the mixture was stirred until a smooth paste formed. Then, the solution pH was adjusted to a selected level 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, or 7 using 10N HCl, 85% H3PO4 or 50% NaOH. Solutions were then stirred at 500 rpm using an overhead mixer for 60 minutes at 4&#xb0; C. to facilitate protein solubility. Samples were left static for 10 min to allow aggregates to precipitate, then transferred to 50 mL falcon tubes and centrifuged for 15 min at room temperature (25&#xb0; C.) at 3,000&#xd7;g. After centrifugation, the protein content of the supernatant was measured by combustion using a Flashsmart protein analyzer (% Nitrogen&#xd7;6.25). The percent protein solubility value was determined based on division of the protein content value in the supernatant by the protein content value in the initial sample (&#xd7;100).</p>

<p id="p-0180" num="0213">This example illustrates the colorimetric characterization of the hemp protein products prepared according to the present invention as described in Examples 2, 4 and 6. L* is normalized to the values 0 to 100 corresponding to a percentage scale which describes the lightness of a sample. L*=100% means 100% light and L*=0 means no light (black). Positive a* values represent reddish tones and negative values greenish tones. A more positive a* value indicates that the tone is more reddish. A more negative a* value indicates that the tone is more greenish. Positive b* values represent yellowish tones and negative b* values represent blueish tones. A more positive b* value indicates that the tone is more yellowish. A more negative b* value indicates that the tone is more blueish. The color measurements of each sample were captured by a Spectro 1&#x2122; colorimeter device (available from Variable Inc., 10 Chattanooga, Tenn., USA) by pointing the device at a container containing a sample and then recording the color of the target sample.</p>

<p id="p-0185" num="0216">The protein-lipid composition protein-lipid complex containing mixture <b>236</b> can be described as a free-flowing powder with a low bulk density (0.26 kg/m<sup>3</sup>). Scanning electron microscopy images of the spray dried material corroborated the low bulk density measurement as the material was observed to exhibit porosity (see: <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>4</b>A,<b>18</b></figref> <b>4</b>B). The inventors consider the porous microstructure of protein-lipid complex containing mixture <b>236</b> surprising since in protein-lipid complex containing mixtures comprising high concentration of lipids, such as 59.3% in the current example mixture, it is expected that protein containing aggregates are formed, and not porous microstructures, as was observed.</p>
<p id="p-0186" num="0217">The microstructure exhibited by protein-lipid complex-containing mixture <b>236</b> may make the material suitable for use in the preparation of a variety formulations, for example, formulations in which a high-water-hydration capacity is desirable, in formulations in which a high oil-holding capacity is desirable, in formulations in which foaming capacity is desirable, or in formulations in which an emulsifying agent is desirable. As shown in Table 21, protein-lipid complex containing mixture <b>236</b> had high oil-holding water-hydration and foam-forming capacities, and may act as an emulsifier.</p>
