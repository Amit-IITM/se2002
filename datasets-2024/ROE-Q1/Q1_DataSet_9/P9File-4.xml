<p id="p-0003" num="0002">The present disclosure relates to fishing lures, and more specifically, to fishing lures with a control system.</p>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">Lures have been used for fishing and spearing activities in many shapes and sizes. The purpose of a lure is generally to attract a desired prey to attack the bait or move to a certain location. Often, a bait is configured with hooks that may attach to the desired prey, in this case a fish, when the fish bites or attacks the bait. Alternatively, spearfishing lures may be configured without hooks and may be used to attract a fish to a particular location.</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">Spearfishing is an activity in which a person throws an object such as a spear, gig, or harpoon at a fish. The spear may strike the fish and the fisherman may retrieve the fish with the spear. Often, when spearfishing, it is preferred that the fish swims to a certain location before the spear is thrown. Spearfishing is a sport that is commonly performed on a frozen body of water. A frozen body of water may have a layer of ice on it such that a spearfishing house may be placed on the surface. A hole may be cut in the ice to allow for a person to throw the spear into the water below the ice. To strike the fish, the fish must be in a location that accommodates for the spear to move through the hole cut in the ice.</p>

<heading id="h-0004" level="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION</heading>
<p id="p-0032" num="0031"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref> schematically illustrates a light up lure <b>20</b> that includes a body <b>30</b> within which is embedded an electronic circuit <b>40</b>. The circuit <b>40</b> may be operated, i.e., powered on and off by a remote magnet M (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref>) as the circuit <b>40</b> is completely embedded in the body <b>30</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0033" num="0032">The body <b>30</b> may be shaped as a fish or other bait to attract prey. Alternatively, the body <b>30</b> may be formed in any shape. The size of the body <b>30</b> may vary in size depending on the specific desired prey. For example, a body <b>30</b> might be sized in a larger embodiment when attempting to attract a larger prey and smaller when attempting to attract a smaller prey.</p>
<p id="p-0034" num="0033">The body <b>30</b> may include a top <b>32</b>, a front <b>34</b>, a bottom <b>36</b> and a rear <b>38</b> (FIG.</p>
<p id="p-0035" num="0034"><b>2</b>). The body <b>30</b> may be manufactured with additional features or elements such as fins <b>50</b> and/or a tail <b>52</b>. The fins <b>50</b> and/or tail <b>52</b> may be useful to simulate a particular prey, or the fins <b>50</b> and/or tail <b>52</b> may cause the body <b>30</b> to move in a certain fashion while in water. The fins <b>50</b> and/or tail <b>52</b> are examples of fixed features that may be manufactured as an element of the body <b>30</b>. Alternatively, the fins <b>50</b> and/or tail <b>52</b> may be articulatable to move as the lure <b>20</b> moves though the water to provide a simulation of live movement.</p>
<p id="p-0036" num="0035">The color of the body <b>30</b> may also vary depending on the desired prey, the environmental conditions, and the fisherman's particular fishing strategy. Fishermen have many different and widely varying fishing strategies. The body <b>30</b> may, for example, be manufactured in any color or color combination. Fishing lures are commonly manufactured in many different colors and color combinations.</p>
<p id="p-0037" num="0036">The body <b>30</b> may be at least partially manufactured from plastic, rubber, metal, or other material. The body <b>30</b> may be at least partially translucent to permit illumination. The body <b>30</b> may be manufactured in one solid piece or may be comprised of multiple separately manufactured pieces. For example, the body <b>30</b> may be injection molded from one mold. Alternatively, the body <b>30</b> may be comprised of multiple separately molded pieces.</p>
<p id="p-0038" num="0037">The circuit <b>40</b> may include a switch <b>60</b> in electrical communication with a light <b>70</b> and a battery <b>80</b> embedded within the body <b>30</b>. The circuit <b>40</b> may also include a near field communication (NFC) tag <b>90</b> that permits communication with a remote NFC chip <b>200</b> such as that within a mobile device <b>210</b>, laptop, etc. The NFC chip <b>200</b> is capable of transmitting and receiving data with the lure <b>20</b> via the NFC tag <b>90</b> as NFC offers a two-way communication channel. The NFC tag <b>90</b> operates through magnetic induction without power from the battery <b>80</b> and draws power from the mobile device <b>210</b>. Although near field communication is disclosed in the illustrated embodiment, other short-range communication protocols such as Bluetooth, Wi-Fi, etc., may alternatively be utilized.</p>
<p id="p-0039" num="0038">The switch <b>60</b>, in one embodiment, may be a latching reed switch. The circuit <b>40</b> is thereby activated using the magnet M. Activating the latching reed switch operates to change the state of the switch <b>60</b> between on and off. The latching reed switch may be in the closed state or open state. The closed state is when electricity is allowed to travel from the battery <b>80</b> through the circuit to cause the light <b>70</b> to light. The open state is when the switch <b>60</b> does not complete the circuit and electricity is not allowed to travel from the battery <b>80</b> to the light <b>70</b>. In one embodiment, the light <b>70</b> may be a light emitting diode of various colors and intensities.</p>
<p id="p-0040" num="0039">In an embodiment, the battery <b>80</b> is a rechargeable battery that is charged through a wireless charger <b>82</b>. The wireless charger <b>82</b> provides for remote inductive charging and permits the complete embedding of the circuit <b>40</b> within the body <b>30</b>. That is, no ports are provided in the body <b>30</b> as the entire circuit <b>40</b> is embedded therein.</p>
<p id="p-0041" num="0040">In another embodiment, the light-up lure <b>20</b> may include a motive source <b>120</b> such as an electric motor as a component of the circuit <b>40</b>. In this embodiment, the motive source <b>120</b> powers a propuslor P to provide rotation of a propeller or flapping of the fins <b>50</b> and/or tail <b>52</b> to provide self-powered swimming movement to the lure <b>20</b>. The movement may be part of a strategy to attract a desired prey.</p>
<p id="p-0042" num="0041">To activate the latching reed switch that is embedded in the body <b>30</b>, the magnet M is located adjacent to the body <b>30</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>2</b> and <b>3</b></figref>). The magnet M is a separate component not attached to the body <b>30</b>. The magnet M may be any type of magnet capable of exerting enough magnetic force upon the switch <b>60</b> such that the switch <b>60</b> is caused to activate. Movement of the magnet M with respect to the switch <b>60</b> permits remote non-contact operation. During passage of the magnet M by the body <b>30</b>, the magnet M and the body <b>30</b> need not touch. During this activation process, there may be an air gap between the magnet M and the body <b>30</b>. Once activated, the latching reed switch shall hold its state until the lure again passes the magnet.</p>
<p id="p-0043" num="0042">In another embodiment, the switch <b>60</b> may be a hall effect sensor. A hall effect sensor may detect the presence and magnitude of a magnetic field. A hall effect sensor may be a solid-state switch that operates by using a combination of different types of semiconductors inside of an integrated circuit (IC) like package. A hall effect sensor may provide a similar function as described with the latching reed switch. The switch <b>60</b> may also be any other type of switching device that may be activated with a magnet M.</p>
<p id="p-0044" num="0043">The body <b>30</b> may be manufactured with or without one or more hooks <b>100</b>. When spearfishing, the body <b>30</b> generally may be manufactured without a hook. Spearfishing generally requires that the desired prey simply move to a certain location such that a fisherman may strike the desired prey with a spear. When used for spearfishing, the body <b>30</b> may be attached to a string, line, pole, or other object which holds the body <b>30</b> in a certain location. Alternatively, the lure <b>20</b> may be used for fishing using a rod. Typically rod fishing is such that a fisherman uses a rod to throw a lure with a hook into water after which the lure with a hook is retrieved using the rod. When the lure <b>20</b> is manufactured for rod fishing, the body <b>30</b> will typically be manufactured with one or more hooks <b>100</b>. When the body <b>30</b> is manufactured with a hook, the hook or hooks may be configured in any manner. For example, hooks may be configured as a barbless hook or may have a barb at various positions on the body <b>30</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0045" num="0044">With reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref>, the light-up lure <b>20</b> may also include an eyelet <b>110</b> to connect the body <b>30</b> to a string, line, pole, or other object for the purpose of holding the light-up lure <b>20</b>. For example, the eyelet <b>100</b> may be attached to the top of the body <b>30</b> such that the light-up lure <b>20</b> may be hung at a particular depth in the water on a string. Alternatively, the eyelet <b>110</b> may be attached such that the light-up lure <b>20</b> may be pulled through the water.</p>
<p id="p-0046" num="0045">In another embodiment, the NFC chip <b>200</b> transmits and receives data through communication with the NFC tag <b>90</b>. The NFC chip <b>200</b> may be &#x201c;swiped&#x201d; or passed adjacent to the NFC tag <b>90</b>, to receive and store data from the NFC tag <b>90</b>, such as, for example, the type of lure, the fish caught, the fish spotted, the physical location, ambient conditions, e.g., temperature, pressure, light levels, speed, etc., and or other conditions and variables that may relate to catching fish. That is, the mobile device <b>210</b> may collect the information and associate that information with the particular lure <b>20</b> from the associated NFC tag <b>90</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0047" num="0046">The mobile device <b>210</b> may perform data processing based on the data obtained from the NFC tag <b>90</b>. This data processing may provide for logging and charting to identify the conditions and locations when a fish was caught. That is, when a fish is caught, the mobile device <b>210</b> is used to swipe the near field communication (NFC) tag <b>90</b> and the information is recorded within a mobile application or other software package on the mobile device <b>210</b>. The recorded information may include information obtained from the sensors of the mobile device, e.g., GPs data, temperature, time, etc. This permits a user to log information over a period of time, e.g., days, months, years, and develop a database of their personal experiences associated with catching fish.</p>
<p id="p-0048" num="0047">The user may also use the logged information to change a feature of the light up lure <b>20</b>, e.g., propulsion speed, light color, intensity, noise, etc. The feature of the light up lure <b>20</b> may be changed through the NFC tag <b>90</b> and/or though other short range communication protocols. For example, the desired feature may be selected in the mobile device <b>210</b> and the mobile device <b>210</b> communicates with the NFC tag <b>90</b> which, in turn may communicate with a control <b>42</b>. The control <b>42</b> may include at least one processor, e.g., microprocessor, microcontroller, digital signal processor, etc., a memory, and an input/output (I/O) interface. The processor and the I/O interface are communicatively coupled to the memory. The memory may be embodied as various forms of ROM, RAM, which stores data and control algorithms such as the logic described herein to control, for example the light <b>70</b> and the motive source <b>120</b>. The I/O interface is communicatively coupled to a number of hardware, firmware, and/or software components, including, for example, the NFC tag <b>90</b>, the light, the motive source <b>120</b>, etc. That is, the control <b>42</b> may provide programmable modifications to operational functions of the lure <b>20</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0049" num="0048">With reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b></figref> a method <b>300</b> for operating the lure <b>20</b> is schematically illustrated. The functions may be programmed software routines capable of execution in various microprocessor-based electronics control embodiments and are represented herein as block diagrams.</p>
<p id="p-0050" num="0049">Initially, the lure <b>20</b> may be activated with the magnet (<b>310</b>). The lure <b>20</b> is then used to fish (<b>320</b>). Once a fish is caught, the lure <b>20</b> may be swiped by the mobile device <b>210</b> (<b>330</b>) to receive data from the NFC tag <b>90</b> which is recorded within a mobile application or other software package on the mobile device <b>210</b>. The data is then logged (<b>340</b>) in the mobile application to develop a database of the user's personal experiences.</p>
<p id="p-0051" num="0050">In some instances, the mobile application may be used to communicate with the NFC tag <b>90</b> which, in turn communicate with the control <b>42</b> to modify operation of the lure <b>20</b> (<b>400</b>). Alternatively, the mobile application may communicate via other short range communication protocols to change a feature of the lure <b>20</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0052" num="0051">NFC communication is a relatively straightforward procedure compared to making changes or pushing buttons on the lure. By permitting remote non-contact activation, the NFC communication provides a configuration that reduces potential failure points. In addition, embedding within the body <b>30</b> ensures that water may not contact the elements embedded therein.</p>
<p id="p-0053" num="0052">Although the different non-limiting embodiments have specific illustrated components, the embodiments of this invention are not limited to those particular combinations. It is possible to use some of the components or features from any of the non-limiting embodiments in combination with features or components from any of the other non-limiting embodiments.</p>
<p id="p-0054" num="0053">The foregoing description is exemplary rather than defined by the limitations within. Various non-limiting embodiments are disclosed herein, however, one of ordinary skill in the art would recognize that various modifications and variations in light of the above teachings will fall within the scope of the appended claims. It is therefore to be appreciated that within the scope of the appended claims, the disclosure may be practiced other than as specifically described. For that reason the appended claims should be studied to determine true scope and content.</p>
