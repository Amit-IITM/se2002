<heading id="h-0001" level="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<heading id="h-0002" level="1">Field of the Invention</heading>
<p id="p-0003" num="0001">The present invention relates to the indoor farming of various crops, specifically cannabis. As various states legalize cannabis, the market for the crop is rapidly growing. Not only do consumers demand more and more supply, they also demand higher quality product comprising various unique strains each having different characteristics. Cannabis growers maintain tight control over the growing process to manage the quality and characteristics of their products.</p>
<p id="p-0004" num="0002">While some cannabis is grown outdoors, like other traditional crops, much is grown indoors where the environment, including lighting, temperature, humidity and other environmental factors can be tightly controlled. Close control over these environmental factors allow the grower to more predictably produce cannabis of specific quality with the various characteristics desired such as THC level. While indoor growing provides many benefits, it also comes with costs such as indoor space and electricity. Cannabis growers are constantly striving to optimize the growth output per square foot while reducing electrical consumption and maintaining high quality product.</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0003">The present invention relates to an apparatus and method for growing cannabis that allows for optimal output and quality using reduced square footage and electricity. The novel apparatus and method described herein provides a substantial improvement in yield, defined as cannabis output per square foot. The computer controlled lighting and environment provide optimal grow characteristics while using only the minimum electricity necessary. The vertical training and vertically disposed lighting provide optimal light coverage to the plant canopy resulting in fast, efficient and high yeild grows.</p>
<heading id="h-0003" level="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0006" num="0004">A novel apparatus and method for growing cannabis indoors is disclosed. The novel apparatus and method allow for more plants to be grown in a given square footage and to produce more output from the same number of plants.</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0005">The improved apparatus includes an improved vertical lighting system, a computerized lighting control system, a powered vertical lighting hanging system, raised horizontally disposed planters and vertical plant training wires. The improved lighting system comprises vertically disposed lighting located between rows of plants. The light system radiates the optimum bandwidth light for plant growth in an even 180 or 360 degree pattern that efficiently covers the maximum amount of the plant canopy. The lighting system is compact, low heat and draws lower levels of electricity than traditional incandescent or fluorescent lighting systems. The timing, bandwidth and intensity of the light are automatically controlled with a computerized control system, as are other environmental factors such as temperature, humidity and soil moisture levels.</p>
<p id="p-0008" num="0006">The cannabis plants are grown in horizontally disposed planters that are installed at a set raised height for easy access. The planters are arranged in rows such that the grower can easily walk between the rows and tend the plants. A series of horizontally strung plant training wires are installed vertically above each row of plants. These wires allow the plants to be trained to grow vertically to allow the plant canopy to be grown so that the maximum surface area possible is exposed to the lighting.</p>
<p id="p-0009" num="0007">The lighting system is mounted to a powered vertical hanging system such that it can easily be raised and lowered into the space between the rows of plants. This allows the lights to be moved out of the way for easy access to the rows of the plants.</p>
<p id="p-0010" num="0008">In an alternative embodiment of the invention, the planter rows are mounted on bearings such that they can be adjusted along the horizontal (x) axis. This allows for denser plant arrangement while still allowing for easy access between rows for plant training and maintenance.</p>
<p id="p-0011" num="0009">In another alternative embodiment of the invention, the planter rows are mounted on hydraulic lifting devices between a storage and maintenance location. The storage location includes rows of lighting that cover both sides of the plant. The plant rows are lowered for plant maintenance, trimming and harvesting.</p>
<p id="p-0012" num="0010">The disclosed method includes planting cannabis plants in raised planters arranged in rows above the ground for easy access, locating vertically disposed lights arrayed such that the emit light in a <b>360</b> radiation pattern. The method also includes raising and lowering the vertical lights to provide access to the plants and training the plants to grow vertically on horizontally disposed wires. Lastly, the lighting is computer controlled to provide optimal conditions for plant growth.</p>

The preferred embodiment further comprises movable vertical lighting units that can be raised and lowered in the rows between the planters, these lighting units comprising, vertically lighting stands, each with lights vertically arranged along the length of the stand and such that the lights provide an even <b>360</b> degree pattern of lighting around the lighting stand, lighting stands arranged in rows located between the rows of planters. Wires, electric motors and pulleys allow the lighting stands to be positioned in a raised position so that the grower can easily walk between the rows of plants or lowered position to provide lighting for the plants. Finally, the disclosed invention provides computer control for the wavelength, intensity and timing of the LED lighting disposed along the lighting stands as well as other environmental factors such as temperature, humidity and soil moisture.</p>
<p id="p-0036" num="0034"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref> shows a plan view of the improved cannabis growing system <b>1</b> of the claimed invention. Cannabis plants <b>6</b> are planted in a number of potting containers <b>2</b> which arranged in a row <b>30</b> and held by plant support <b>7</b> in a series of plant holes <b>18</b>. Any number of cannabis plants <b>6</b> can be included in each row <b>30</b>, but <b>15</b> cannabis plants per row <b>30</b>, supported in plant support <b>7</b>, is the number used in this disclosed preferred embodiment.</p>
<p id="p-0037" num="0035">Each of these rows <b>30</b> is framed by Unistrut, which is the trademark name for a metal slotted channel material with various attachment means such as brackets, channel nuts, threaded rods and clamps, shown by upper support <b>5</b> and lower support <b>3</b> in this diagram. Additional elements of the Unistrut supports will be shown in other figures. Horizontal training wires <b>9</b> are extended horizontally along each row <b>30</b> of cannabis plants <b>6</b>. A number of horizontal training wires <b>9</b> are disposed vertically above each row of cannabis plants. These horizontal training wires <b>9</b> are used to train the growth of the cannabis plants <b>6</b> vertically so that the plant canopy will be exposed to the maximum amount of light.

In this embodiment, the cannabis plants <b>211</b> are stored toward the ceiling of the grow space, in a densely packed configuration and lowered to be trimmed, pruned, and harvested. This embodiment has two positions for the plants, raised and lowered. In this view, cannabis plants <b>211</b> are in their lowered position. In the lowered position, they can be trimmed, pruned, and harvested easily by humans. In the raised position, cannabis plants <b>211</b> are stored, and are located at the ceiling of the grow space. One of the key advantages of this embodiment is the greater density of the plant rows while in the stored position. While only one plant row <b>213</b> is shown in this view, this configuration can be built with a variable number of rows based on the available grow space. In this embodiment, cannabis plants <b>211</b> are located in potting containers <b>208</b>, which are located in plant holes <b>207</b> and held by plant support <b>209</b>. Plants are supported by training wires <b>212</b>. Plant row <b>213</b> is raised and lowered on hydraulic lift <b>205</b>. Hydraulic lift <b>205</b> could be any hydraulic lift well known in the art, particularly one with two vertical supports similar to those used in auto repair shops. In this embodiment, hydraulic lift <b>205</b> is approximately <b>2080</b> mm in height to comply with anticipated regulation requiring at least 80&#x2033; of height. The width of the lift will be modified such that each side of the lift will be approximately 20 feet apart or more. This increased width requires only a cable and hydraulic hose extension. Each row will require its own hydraulic lift <b>205</b>, which for a <b>500</b> square foot room, would be 12-14 rows if the rows are 20 feet long. Example hydraulic lifts suitable for this purpose are those manufactured by Peak Lifts, but any suitable hydraulic lift known in the art could be utilized. Hydraulic lift controls <b>210</b> cause plant row <b>213</b> to be raised and lowered. Base <b>206</b> attaches hydraulic lift <b>205</b> to the floor of the grow space.</p>
