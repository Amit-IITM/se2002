<p id="p-0004" num="0003">The present invention relates to sterile filtration of a liquid lactase preparation.</p>
<heading id="h-0004" level="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">Lactase enzymes, which are also sometimes referred to as beta-galactosidase enzymes, are used commercially to break down lactose in milk to produce dairy products which are suitable for people with lactose intolerance and/or have a sweeter taste. Lactases have been isolated from a large variety of organisms, including microorganisms, such as yeast and bacteria.</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">WO 2009/071539 discloses use of a C-terminally truncated fragment of the extracellular lactase from <i>Bifidobacterium bifidum </i>in the production of low-lactose dairy products.</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">Lactase may be added to milk either before or after pasteurisation or sterilization. In general lac-tase will be inactivated during pasteurisation or sterilization treatment. When lactase is added before sterilization, a large amount of lactase may be required in order to reduce the storage time between addition and pasteurisation/sterilization. Alternatively, lactase may be added after pasteurisation/sterilization of the milk. In this case, lactase may be added in a lower amount, as the enzyme can digest lactose during transport and storage in the factory, shop and/or in the refrigerator of the consumer. Lactase to be added after pasteurisation/sterilization of the milk has to be sterile. One preferred way of sterilizing lactase is by sterile filtration. Sterile filtration of the lactase may be performed in-line within the production process of the lactose-free milk, for example using the Aldose&#xae; system (Tetrapak International S.A., Pully, Switzerland), or it may be performed at the production site of the lactase manufacturer. The sterile lactase solution is then dosed aseptically into the milk, for instance by means of the Flexdos&#xae; system (Tetrapak International S.A., Pully, Switzerland). Sterile filtration of the lactase solution is achieved by pumping the enzyme concentrate through a at least one filter with an absolute pore size of 0.22 &#x3bc;m, and that will retain particles such as fungi, bacteria, spores still present in the solution. Prior to passing through the sterile filters, the solution may be pumped through one or several pre-filters with a larger pore size than 0.22 &#x3bc;m and that will retain large particle but will not contribute to sterility of the lactase solution.</p>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">Commercial lactase preparations used by the dairy processing industry are often aqueous solution to which one or more stabilizing agents have been added, such as glycerol. Glycerol promotes microbial as well as enzymatic stabilization. Lactase preparations comprising, e.g., 50% glycerol are somewhat viscous and may not be treated easily through sterile filters.</p>
<p id="p-0009" num="0008">Improved formulations of sterile lactase are still needed, e.g., liquid formulations which can be more easily processed through sterile filters.</p>
<p id="p-0010" num="0009">WO2015/132349 discloses use of e.g. sodium chloride in an aqueous liquid lactase formulation. WO 2016/071500 discloses use of e.g. sodium chloride in a spray-dried composition of a beta-galactosidase enzyme. Possible ultrafiltration of the enzyme-containing fermentation broth is suggested as a possible means for concentrating the enzyme prior to its formulation. Sterile filtration is not mentioned in any of these disclosures.</p>
<heading id="h-0005" level="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0011" num="0010">The present inventors have surprisingly found that addition of salt to a liquid lactase preparation improves its ability to be passed through a sterile filter. In particular, it is surprising that addition of monovalent cation to a liquid lactase preparation improves its ability to be passed through a sterile filter.</p>
<p id="p-0012" num="0011">The invention therefore provides a sterile-filtered liquid lactase preparation comprising at least one salt having a monovalent or divalent cation, wherein the total concentration of said at least one salt is at least 0.01% w/w.</p>

<p id="p-0038" num="0047">In the context of the present invention, the activity in LAU-B/g of a specific lactase may be determined by direct measurement of o-nitrophenyl (ONP) released from o-nitrophenyl &#x3b2;-D-galactopyranoside (ONPG) in a buffer containing 1.46 mg/ml substrate in 0.05 M MES, 1 mM MgSO<sub>4 </sub>7H<sub>2</sub>O, 450 mg/L Brij 35 at pH6.5 and 30&#xb0; C. After 600 seconds incubation, the reaction is stopped by adding 0.2 M Na<sub>2</sub>CO<sub>3 </sub>and the released ONP is measured at 405 nm after 126 seconds incubation. The skilled person will know how to execute this assay and determine such activity. Here, the activity is obtained by comparing to a standard curve run with a lactase of known activity, and the activity of the unknown sample calculated from this. The lactase of known activity may, e.g., be Saphera&#xae; obtained from Novozymes A/S, Denmark.</p>
<p id="p-0039" num="0048">A lactase in the context of the present invention is any glycoside hydrolase having the ability to hydrolyse the disaccharide lactose into constituent galactose and glucose monomers. The group of lactases comprises but is not limited to enzymes assigned to subclass EC 3.2.1.108. Enzymes assigned to other subclasses, such as, e.g., EC 3.2.1.23, may also be lactases in the context of the present invention. A lactase in the context of the invention may have other activities than the lactose hydrolysing activity, such as for example a transgalactosylating activity. In the context of the invention, the lactose hydrolysing activity of the lactase may be referred to as its lactase activity or its beta-galactosidase activity.</p>
<p id="p-0040" num="0049">The lactase may be of animal, of plant or of microbial origin. Preferred enzymes are obtained from microbial sources, in particular from a filamentous fungus or yeast, or from a bacterium.</p>

<p id="p-0048" num="0056">The lactase may be extracellular. It may have a signal sequence at its N-terminus, which is cleaved off during secretion.</p>
<p id="p-0049" num="0057">The lactase may be obtained from any organism. The term &#x201c;obtained from&#x201d; means in this context that the enzyme may have been isolated from an organism where it is present natively, i.e. the identity of the amino acid sequence of the enzyme are identical to a native enzyme. The term &#x201c;obtained&#x201d; also means that the enzymes may have been produced recombinantly in a host organism, the recombinantly produced enzyme having either an identity identical to a native enzyme or having a modified amino acid sequence, e.g. having one or more amino acids which are deleted, inserted and/or substituted, i.e. a recombinantly produced enzyme which is a mutant and/or a fragment of a native amino acid sequence. Within the meaning of a native enzyme are included natural variants. Furthermore, the term &#x201c;obtained from&#x201d; includes enzymes produced synthetically by, e.g., peptide synthesis. The term &#x201c;obtained from&#x201d; also encompasses enzymes which have been modified e.g. by glycosylation, phosphorylation etc., whether in vivo or in vitro. With respect to recombinantly produced enzyme the term &#x201c;obtained from&#x201d; refers to the identity of the enzyme and not the identity of the host organism in which it is produced recombinantly.</p>
<p id="p-0050" num="0058">The lactase may be produced from a microorganism by use of any suitable technique. For instance, a lactase enzyme preparation may be produced by fermentation of a suitable microorganism and subsequent isolation of a lactase preparation from the resulting fermented broth or microorganism by methods known in the art. The lactase may also be produced by use of recombinant DNA techniques. Such method normally comprises cultivation of a host cell transformed with a recombinant DNA vector comprising a DNA sequence encoding the lactase in question and the DNA sequence being operationally linked with an appropriate expression signal such that it is capable of expressing the lactase in a culture medium under conditions permitting the expression of the enzyme and recovering the enzyme from the culture. The DNA sequence may also be incorporated into the genome of the host cell. The DNA sequence may be of genomic, cDNA or synthetic origin or any combinations of these, and may be isolated or synthesized in accordance with methods known in the art.</p>
<p id="p-0051" num="0059">The lactase may be purified. The term &#x201c;purified&#x201d; as used herein covers lactase enzyme protein essentially free from insoluble components from the production organism. The term &#x201c;purified&#x201d; also covers lactase enzyme protein essentially free from insoluble components from the native organism from which it is obtained. Preferably, it is also separated from some of the soluble components of the organism and culture medium from which it is derived. More preferably, it is separated by one or more of the unit operations: filtration, precipitation, or chromatography.</p>
<p id="p-0052" num="0060">Accordingly, the lactase may be purified, viz. only minor amounts of other proteins being present. The expression &#x201c;other proteins&#x201d; relate in particular to other enzymes. The term &#x201c;purified&#x201d; as used herein also refers to removal of other components, particularly other proteins and most particularly other enzymes present in the cell of origin of the lactase. The lactase may be &#x201c;substantially pure&#x201d;, i.e. substantially free from other components from the organism in which it is produced, i.e., e.g., a host organism for recombinantly produced lactase.</p>
<p id="p-0053" num="0061">The lactase in the preparation is preferably a neutral lactase. The neutral lactase preferably is active, or has its optimal activity, at a pH between pH 4 and pH 8, preferably between pH 5 and pH 7.</p>

<p id="p-0055" num="0063">The lactase in the preparation of the invention may be obtained as an optionally concentrated extract e.g. from a fungal, a yeast or a bacterial production strain. Preferably such extract has undergone a solid-liquid separation step, by e.g. centrifugation or filtration, to remove the solids. Such extract may contain natural components from the production cells as well as remainders of the fermentation media. Examples of such components are nucleic acid, protein, residual sugars, oligosaccharides, intrinsic enzymes, salts, minerals, intracellular components, ions, and nucleotides or other components. These components may end up, to some extent, in the lactase preparation of the invention.</p>
<p id="p-0056" num="0064">The lactase in the preparation of the invention may be a concentrated non-purified lactase or it may have been purified. A concentrated non-purified lactase may have been obtained by releasing the enzyme from the host cells, removing the solids for instance by means of filtration or centrifugation and by concentrating the liquid phase comprising the lactase by means of for instance ultrafiltration. Alternatively, the lactase may have been purified, for example by using chromatography.</p>

<p id="p-0159" num="0181">All 900 LAU-B/g lactase solutions containing salt tested here showed a measurable improvement in filterability through a sterile filter compared to the control sample: the volume V<sub>max </sub>of lactase solution needed to reach the maximum pressure set point was higher in all accounts.</p>
<heading id="h-0010" level="1">EXAMPLE 2</heading>
<p id="p-0160" num="0182">Improved Filterability of <i>Bifidobacterium bifidum </i>Lactase Through Sterile Filter Under Very Low Salt Conditions.</p>
<p id="p-0161" num="0183">An unstandardized enzyme concentrate of B. bifidum lactase (SEQ ID NO: 1) expressed in <i>Bacillus licheniformis </i>and that had been produced in large scale was chosen as start material. The unstandardized concentrate had been originally formulated in large scale with 66% w/w glycerol at pH 5.7.</p>
<p id="p-0162" num="0184">The concentrate was then diluted with glycerol and water in absence or presence of sodium chloride down to an enzyme concentration equivalent to 900 LAU-B/g lactase units per gram: the unstandardized lactase concentrate was first pre-diluted with pure glycerol prior to adding salt as powder; a control sample did not contain added salt. Water was eventually added to a final volume of 1 L, as described in the table here below. The final glycerol concentration was 50% w/w in all samples. Upon dilution of the unstandardized lactase concentrate the cations and anions present were diluted so extensively that the total amount of ions leftover in the samples were very low to negligible compared to the different salt added voluntarily during this experiment.</p>

<p id="p-0164" num="0185">The unstandardized lactase concentrate and the pure glycerol solution were both kept at temperatures around 10 &#xb0; C. to 15 &#xb0; C. prior to start. All salts tested here were food grade quality and supplied by Sigma Aldrich Corp. (St. Louis, Mo., USA). Thorough mixing was achieved with a magnetic stir bar under midly cold conditions (15&#xb0; C.) in a water bath.</p>
<p id="p-0165" num="0186">All diluted enzyme solutions were then sterile filtered on 47 mm Fluorodyne&#xae; II DFL membrane filter discs (Pall, Port Washington, N.Y., USA) with a cutoff of 0.2 pm. The filter discs were maintained in a 47 mm inline stainless steel filter holder (Sartorius, Gottingen, Germany) and the diluted enzyme solutions were pumped through the filters by means of a FilterTec normal flow filtration system (Parker Hannifin Corp., Oxnard, Calif., USA) under constant flow regime of 10 ml/min and until the system pressure reached a maximum of 1.8 bar. The filtrations were carried out at room temperature, within 30-60 min after diluting the unstandardized enzyme concentrate.</p>
<p id="p-0166" num="0187">The table here below lists the volume Vmax of the different solutions that was needed to reach an arbitrary, maximum pressure set point of 1.8 bar in the filtration system. The volume V<sub>max </sub>of the &#x201c;control&#x201d; sample was set to 100%; the volumes for the other solutions are therefore proportional to the base 100.</p>
