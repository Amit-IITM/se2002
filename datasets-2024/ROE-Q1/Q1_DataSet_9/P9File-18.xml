<heading id="h-0001" level="1">CROSS REFERENCE TO RELATED APPLICATION</heading>
<p id="p-0002" num="0001">The present application claims priority to Korean Patent Application No. 10-2022-0006189, filed Jan. 14, 2022, the entire contents of which is incorporated herein for all purposes by this reference.</p>
<heading id="h-0002" level="1">BACKGROUND OF THE DISCLOSURE</heading>
<heading id="h-0003" level="1">Field of the Disclosure</heading>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">The present disclosure relates to a device, and more particularly to an insertion unit and a detachable endoscope including the same.</p>
<heading id="h-0004" level="1">Background Art</heading>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">In general, a surgery using an endoscope is to insert an endoscope equipped with a camera and a surgery tool through a small hole without making a large incision in the body of a patient, and then proceed with the surgery while observing the affected part of the patient through the image taken by the endoscope in the body. In particular, the endoscopic surgery starting from laparoscopic surgery has advantages in that the incision region is smaller than that of laparotomy, so the scar region is also small, and there is little bleeding, which leads to the quick patient recovery after the surgery.</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">The conventional endoscopes are integrally constituted with an insertion part intended to be inserted into the human body and an operation part that operates the insertion part, and a plurality of channels and guides are embedded through the inside of each part. In particular, an image sensing device such as an expensive CCD is provided at the front end of the insertion part inserted into the body. Therefore, it is difficult to separate only the insertion part from the operation part and replace it with a new one. To overcome this problem, in line with the trend of strengthening the sanitary function of medical endoscopes, various types of detachable endoscopes are being used in which an insertion part intended to be inserted into the body and an operation part for operating the insertion part are connected to each other when being used, or separated from each other when being stored.</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">However, the conventional detachable endoscope has a problem in that contaminants introduced through the insertion part during the endoscopic procedure enter the inside of the coupled operation part by the medium of the intermediate connection part. In this case, due to the nature of the operation part having a complex internal structure, it is difficult to clean the inside thereof, and accordingly, since the inside of the operation part is contaminated, even though the insertion unit is replaced later, contaminants are re-introduced into the replaced insertion part during the procedure, resulting in the cause of infection in a patient undergoing the endoscopic procedure.</p>
<heading id="h-0005" level="1">SUMMARY OF THE DISCLOSURE</heading>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">A technical problem to be addressed by the present disclosure is to provide a detachable endoscope capable of preventing contamination of the inside of an operation part by structurally separating an insertion part and the operation part.</p>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">Technical drawbacks, which the present disclosure is to address, are limited to the aforementioned ones, and unmentioned or other technical drawbacks may be clearly appreciated from the following detailed description by a person having ordinary skill in the art to which the present disclosure belongs.</p>
<p id="p-0009" num="0008">To accomplish the above-described technical objects, an insertion unit for a detachable endoscope according to an example of this disclosure may include a housing having a hollow formed penetrating both ends of the housing but being isolated from an outside of the housing; a first intermediate connection part inserted into an inside of the housing to penetrate the both ends of the housing; and a second intermediate connection part spaced apart from the first intermediate connection part and inserted penetrating the hollow.</p>
<p id="p-0010" num="0009">According to an example of this disclosure, a plurality of the first intermediate connection parts may be provided, and the plurality ofthe first intermediate connection parts may be arranged to be spaced apart along an inner circumference direction of the housing and to surround the hollow.</p>
<p id="p-0011" num="0010">According to an example of this disclosure, the insertion unit for a detachable endoscope may further include an elastic member disposed inside the hollow and between a stepped part included in the hollow and one end of the second intermediate connection part to provide elastic force to the second intermediate connection part.</p>
<p id="p-0012" num="0011">According to an example of this disclosure, the insertion unit for a detachable endoscope may further include a curved connection part connected to one end of the second intermediate connection part and at least partially curved with respect to a longitudinal direction of the second intermediate connection part.</p>
<p id="p-0013" num="0012">According to an example of this disclosure, at each of both ends of the second intermediate connection part, a sealing member for sealing a space between the second intermediate connection part and the hollow may be provided.</p>
<p id="p-0014" num="0013">To accomplish the above-described technical objects, a detachable endoscope according to an example of this disclosure may include an insertion unit according to any one of claims <b>1</b> to <b>5</b>, whose one end is intended to be inserted into a body; an operation unit coupled to another end of the insertion unit, and operating the one end of the insertion unit to perform a bending motion; and a detachment unit for detachably coupling the operation unit and the insertion unit.</p>
<p id="p-0015" num="0014">According to an example of this disclosure, when the insertion unit and the operation unit are coupled, a discharge passage part may be formed between a first coupling end of the operation unit and a second coupling end of the insertion unit, which are disposed to face each other.</p>
<p id="p-0016" num="0015">According to the examples of the present disclosure, the insertion unit and the detachable endoscope including the insertion unit have a sealed hollow formed inside the insertion unit, so that they can induce contaminants such as blood flowing thereinto during an endoscopic procedure to flow only into the aforementioned hollow. Additionally, the contaminants passing through the hollow of the insertion unit are discharged through the discharge passage part formed between the insertion unit and the operation unit when the two units are coupled, so that the inside of the operation unit can be prevented from being contaminated, thereby addressing the cleaning problem of the operation unit, and enabling its reuse.</p>
<p id="p-0017" num="0016">The effects of the present disclosure are not limited to the aforementioned effects, but should be understood as including all effects that can be inferred from the configuration provided by the description or claims of the present application.</p>

<p id="p-0043" num="0042">Accordingly, the intermediate connection member <b>105</b> and a second intermediate connection body <b>315</b>, and a second insertion end connection body <b>345</b> coupled thereto and the fifth operation wire <b>205</b> move in the direction of being pulled toward the operation unit <b>100</b> (hereinafter, referred to as the force applying direction) (e.g., &#x2212;Y axis direction), so that force can be applied to the force applying module <b>400</b> connected to the fifth operation wire <b>205</b> in the force applying direction (&#x2212;Y axis direction). Accordingly, the force applying module <b>400</b> can pivot in the first rotation direction R<b>1</b> toward the operation unit <b>100</b> around the pivot axis C (see <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>8</b></figref>).</p>

<p id="p-0045" num="0044">The third operation part H<b>30</b> may be provided with an elastic part (not shown). This elastic part may be compressed and deformed as the third operation part H<b>30</b> is rotated in the operation direction by the user. Thereafter, by generating an elastic restoring force in the opposite direction to the operation direction and returning the third operation part H<b>30</b> to its original position when the force applied to the third operation part H<b>30</b> is removed, the hydraulic pressure applied to the linear movement shaft is removed, so that the intermediate connection member <b>105</b>, the second insertion end connection part <b>340</b>&#x2032;, and the fifth operation wire <b>205</b> can move back in an opposite direction (Y axis direction) to the force applying direction. Accordingly, the force applying module <b>400</b> can rotate in the second rotation direction R<b>2</b> opposite to the first rotation direction R<b>1</b>, and can return to the original position.</p>
<p id="p-0046" num="0045">A part (i.e., the insertion end) of the insertion unit <b>200</b> may be inserted into the body during an endoscopic procedure.

<p id="p-0049" num="0048">In this case, the force applying module <b>400</b> may apply force to the procedure equipment, which has been moved to the outside of the insertion end through the opening, to bend the procedure equipment toward a position where the medical procedure is required. For example, during an endoscopic procedure, by rotating the force applying module <b>400</b> in the first rotation direction R<b>1</b> using the third operation part H<b>30</b>, the procedure equipment can be bent in a direction corresponding to the first rotation direction Rl. In the case where the endoscopic procedure is completed or the procedure equipment needs to be replaced, by removing the force applied to the third operation part H<b>30</b> and returning the force applying module <b>400</b> to its original position, it is possible to remove the force applied to the procedure equipment and return it to the state before the bending.</p>

In addition, the contaminants discharged to the outside of the second insertion end hollow HL can flow or fall downward along the second movement direction A&#x2033; by the action of gravity, and can be discharged to the outside of the detachable endoscope <b>10</b> through the discharge passage part.</p>
<p id="p-0129" num="0128">As such, since contaminants are discharged to the outside through the discharge passage part, contaminants introduced into the endoscope <b>10</b> during endoscopic procedures can be prevented from being introduced into the operation unit <b>100</b>. Accordingly, even though the insertion unit <b>200</b> is contaminated when an endoscopic procedure is performed, the inside of the operation unit <b>100</b> can be prevented from being contaminated. As a result, when the next endoscopic procedure is performed after the previous endoscopic procedure is completed, the procedure can be performed only by replacing the insertion unit <b>200</b> with a new unit, while preventing the occurrence of infectious diseases among patients. In addition, it is possible to reuse the operation unit <b>100</b>, which has a relatively complex structure, such as including the operation module H, and is expensive to manufacture, so the need for washing is reduced, and there may be a great advantage in terms of economy.</p>
<p id="p-0130" num="0129">As described above, according to the embodiments of the present disclosure, the insertion unit <b>200</b> and the detachable endoscope <b>10</b> including the insertion unit <b>200</b> have a sealed hollow formed inside the insertion unit <b>200</b>, so that they can induce contaminants such as blood flowing thereinto during an endoscopic procedure to flow only into the aforementioned hollow. Additionally, the contaminants passing through the hollow of the insertion unit <b>200</b> are discharged through the discharge passage part formed between the insertion unit <b>200</b> and the operation unit <b>100</b> when the two units are coupled, so that the inside of the operation unit <b>100</b> can be prevented from being contaminated, thereby addressing the cleaning problem of the operation unit <b>100</b>, and enabling its reuse.</p>
<p id="p-0131" num="0130">The afore-mentioned description of the disclosure is just an example, and a person having ordinary skill in the art may understand that it can be easily modified into other specific configuration without changing the technical spirit or essential features of the disclosure. Accordingly, it should be understood that the embodiments described above are illustrative in every respect and not restrictive. For example, the respective components described as a singular form may be implemented in a distributed form, and likewise the respective components described as a distributed form may be implemented in a combined form.</p>
<p id="p-0132" num="0131">The scope of the present disclosure is represented by the following claims, and all modifications and changes derived from the meaning and scope of the claims and equivalent concepts thereof should be interpreted as being included in the scope of the present disclosure.</p>
