<heading id="h-0002" level="1">FIELD OF INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">The present invention relates generally to apparatus and method of use for a plant growing container. More particularly, the present invention is related to an improved design for water-retaining grow bags/pots.</p>
<heading id="h-0003" level="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">Water consumption by the growing plants tax the environment in regions with scarce water supply. Each potted plant could consume from 3-6 liters of water/day depending on the foliage size. While watering potted plants, the majority of water is lost in the runoff. Additionally, this runoff causes loss of nutrients. This is especially true with the grow bags, since this water loss is accentuated by the rapid evaporation facilitated by the porous nature of the grow bag. Although porous fabric improves root pruning by drying out the root tips, over time, this feature could limit the absorption of water and nutrients.</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">In the past, various attempts have been made to solve the issue of dehydration of root tips such as placing the grow bag in a water bath, installing drip irrigation directly to the root, frequent low volume watering by setting timer, etc. Although the above methods fixed some of the challenges, there was no one method that solved it all, and were not economical, and or user-friendly. In addition, they resulted in problems such as over watering, root rotting, and the constant high level of moisture resulted in unsightly moss and/or mold growth in the growing medium and/or on the outer surface of the grow bags, which reduced their appeal for indoor usage. Conventional grow bag systems have likewise required constant watering due to water runoff and evaporation through the permeable fabric. In addition, conventional grow bag systems fail to maintain optimum temperature of the growing medium.</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">Household gardening has been improved due to the introduction of the permeable grow bags, but this does not solve the problem of runoff water and nutrients from the growing medium. In fact, the biggest challenge in home gardening continues to be the demand for frequent watering of the plants due to the lack of a system which will reduce or eliminate the water &#x26; nutrient run off and reduce hypoxia of the roots by ensuring adequate oxygen supply to the roots.</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">It may, therefore, be advantageous to provide an improved design for water-retaining grow bags/pots.</p>

<heading id="h-0006" level="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0019" num="0018">Some embodiments of the present invention are described with specificity herein to meet statutory requirements. However, the scope of the invention is not intended to be defined by the description itself. The claimed subject matter may be embodied as to include different features, elements, components, steps, or combinations of steps, similar to those described herein, and in combination with other existing or future technologies. Moreover, although the term &#x201c;step&#x201d; might be used to connote different elements of the methods employed, this term should not be interpreted as implying any particular order among or between various steps herein disclosed unless and except the order of individual steps is explicitly described or required.</p>
<p id="p-0020" num="0019">Embodiments of the present invention may recycle the runoff water and nutrients into the plant's growing medium through a self-wicking mechanism. In this way, embodiments of the present invention may enable the growing medium to retain moisture longer, thus resulting in better nutrient absorption and luscious plant growth. The growing medium may include, but is not limited to, soil, compose, mulch, vermiculite, zeolite, pumice, peat moss, coconut coir, clay balls or pebbles, sand, silt, or the like, or combinations thereof. Some embodiments of the present invention may collect the runoff water into a reservoir attached to the underside of the grow bag, which is then recycled back to the growing medium through a central self-wicking column through capillary action. The rate of water absorption may be controlled by the plant's hydration needs, thus preventing dehydration, water logging and rotting of roots and eliminates the moss growth on the outer surface of the bag.</p>
<p id="p-0021" num="0020">Embodiments of the present invention may enable the recycling of the runoff water and nutrients by a self-wicking mechanism back into the growing media in a controlled and sustained manner. This process of recycling of the runoff may provide the plant with optimum hydration, nutrient supply and aeration of the growth media thus eliminating hypoxia and resulting in increased biomass and fruit/ flower production. The increased soil aeration and moisture retention features may bolster root pruning and root nutrition, optimizing the yield while conserving resources such as water and soil nutrients.</p>
<p id="p-0022" num="0021">Embodiments of the present invention may incorporate a self-watering apparatus to the traditional grow bag. Embodiments of the present invention may be designed as a cloth grow bag with a central opening at the bottom, through which a central wicking column may be inserted.</p>
<p id="p-0023" num="0022">The centrally located water wicking column enables consistent hydration and minimizes water loss. This central wicking column may be attached to the lid of a runoff collecting basin. In some embodiments, the runoff collecting basin may be designed to store water.</p>
