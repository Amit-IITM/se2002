<?summary-of-invention description="Summary of Invention" end="lead"?>
<heading id="h-0002" level="1">FIELD OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">The invention is directed to the field of pet grooming and, in particular, to a storage tray for pet grooming clipper and trimmer blades.</p>
<heading id="h-0003" level="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">Pet grooming appliances, commonly referred to as clippers and/or trimmers, include interchangeable cutting blades for clipping and trimming pet hair. The interchangeable cutting blades permit the use of different types of cutting blades to treat the hair types found with various breeds of animals.</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">Skip tooth blades are a standard option to start a grooming procedure while fine-teeth blades have closely spaced teeth ideal for thin and soft haired pets. Blades can be further sized for coat length. The type of blade and blade size allow the pet groomer to carefully groom the pet to beyond the pet owner's expectations.</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">Blade construction may be chrome plated stainless steel, carbon, silver or titanium. Cutter blade sizes can be expressed in numbers from 3 to 50. For instance: number 3 blades may provide a 13 mm coat length; number blades 5 may provide a 6 mm coat length; number 7 blade may provide a 3.2 mm coat length; number 9 blade may provide a 2 mm coat length; number 30 blade may provide a 0.5 mm coat length to name a few. Commonly it takes 2-4 blades to groom one dog. For instance, Poodle groomers would likely use a number 7 blade for the body, number 10 or 15 for the head, number 3 or 5 for the legs, and number 10 or 15 for the tail. During the grooming process, the cutting blade will heat up and, if left unchecked, can burn the skin of the animal being groomed. For this reason blade changes are frequently made allowing a cutting blade to cool off during use. Preferably the various interchangeable blades are kept near the grooming table so that the pet being groomed is not left unattended.</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">Thus, a need exists for a storage tray securable to a grooming table for use in dissipating the heat from cutting blades using a platform elevated above the grooming table.</p>
<heading id="h-0004" level="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">Disclosed is a storage tray having a plurality of slanted surfaces, each configured to support a trimmer blade. Upon resting a hot blade against the surface, a cooling fan passes air through the storage tray to dissipate heat quickly and permit the interchangeable use of blades during grooming sessions. Securing the storage tray to a grooming table pole vertical pole allows the lower surface of the tray to be exposed to air circulation allowing faster heat dissipation and keeps the grooming table free of obstructions. The cooling fan is powered through a USB cable coupling to an external power source.</p>
<p id="p-0009" num="0008">In the instant invention, the storage tray has a generally rectangular main body constructed of plastic, the bottom of the storage tray having a plurality of through holes. The tray has a plurality of separate sections, each section having a slanted surface upon constructed and arranged to hold an individual cutting blade. In another embodiment, marble or ceramic material can placed over the slanted surface to provide enhanced heat dissipation. The storage tray is attached to the vertical arm of a grooming table by fasteners. When in use, the storage tray is easily accessible by the groomer for insertion and retrieval of specific cutting blades during a pet grooming session, which the cooling fans quickly dissipates heat from cutting blades placed on the storage tray. An extension tray can be attached to the storage tray to hold clippers, scissors and the like items commonly used during the grooming process. A cell phone holder is electrical coupled to the USB fan cord to keep the cordage off the grooming table.</p>
<p id="p-0010" num="0009">An objective of the invention is to provide a support tray for clipper and trimmer blades that is securable to the vertical arm of a conventional grooming table.</p>
<p id="p-0011" num="0010">Another objective of the invention is to provide a support tray containing cooling fans or a marble material for use in cooling clipper and trimmer blades.</p>
<p id="p-0012" num="0011">Still another objective of the invention is take advantage of mounting the support tray on a vertical arm to allowing air circulation beneath the support tray, as well as keep the grooming table open for the grooming process.</p>
<p id="p-0013" num="0012">Yet still another objective of the invention is to provide an economical support tray that can be sized to fit four or more cutting blades allowing ease of access to the pet groomer and assuring cutting blades are cooled quickly allowing reuse.</p>
<p id="p-0014" num="0013">Other objectives and advantages of this invention will become apparent from the following description taken in conjunction with any accompanying drawings wherein are set forth, by way of illustration and example, certain embodiments of this invention.
