A toothbrush with a dentifrice is commonly used for cleaning the teeth. Dental picks and flosses are used to dislodge food particles and plaque from between teeth. Mouthwash is used in oral hygiene for rinsing the teeth, gums, and mouth. Mouthwash helps to check the microbial growth in the mouth and prevents bad breath. Thus, proper oral hygiene is not only important for well-being and preventing diseases, but also affects the persona of a person.</p>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">Normally, different accessories for maintaining oral hygiene are available at a residence, for example, in a washroom. The problem occurs when a person is away from his residence, such as traveling. A traveler must carry different accessories including the toothbrush, dentifrice, dental floss or dental pick, and the mouthwash. Carrying such multiple accessories is often troublesome for the traveler. Often the travelers miss carrying one or more of such accessories that negatively affect certain aspects of oral hygiene.</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">While staying at hotels or similar places, guests are provided with amenity kits that include different accessories for oral hygiene. However, such amenity kits are costly and unmanageable.</p>
