<heading id="h-0002" level="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">Many different makeup bags, containers, satchels, and purses exist with differing sizes and shapes to hold cosmetic items for a user. Some of these products include compartments to facilitate organization of the cosmetic items. In most cases, existing makeup containers or bags are either stationary and designed for organizing and storing makeup at home or are designed for portability to take makeup on a trip. However, the portable makeup containers or bags fail to provide enhanced organization such that when the user is on the go, cosmetic items become disorganized, resulting in the user having to reorganize the cosmetic products once the user arrives at a desired location. Thus, what is needed is an improved makeup bag that provides enhanced organization for cosmetic products such that the cosmetic products remain organized during transportation from one location to another.</p>

<p id="p-0014" num="0013">One embodiment of the present invention describes an improved makeup bag. The improved makeup bag includes an outer portion and an interior portion. The outer portion includes a first outer side disposed opposite a second outer side and a fixation means configured to affix the first outer side to the second outer side. The interior portion includes a first interior side disposed opposite a second interior side. Each of the first interior side and the second interior side comprise one or more compartments. Further, each of the one or more compartments are configured to receive one or more cosmetic, personal care, or beauty products therein.</p>
<p id="p-0015" num="0014">In examples, the fixation means include: a zipper component, hook and loop, snaps, fasteners, buttons, magnets, hook and loop fasteners, or teeth and groove fasteners. In some examples, each of the first interior side and the second interior side are about 7 inches in width and about 12 inches in length. Moreover, the cosmetic product may specifically be a skincare product, a haircare product, or a nailcare product. The skincare product may be: a lipstick, tweezers, a lip balm, a pressed powder compact, a mascara, an eyeliner, a face primer, a liquid foundation, a moisturizer, a sunscreen, an eyeshadow palette, a concealer, a bronzer, a blush, or a lip gloss.</p>
<p id="p-0016" num="0015">Further, dimensions of the improved makeup bag comprise a length of about 8 inches, a width of about 8-8&#xbd; inches, and a height of about 7 inches. Additionally, a material of each of the one or more compartments may include fabric such as cloth, cotton, canvas, mesh, satin, heavy satin, polyester, nylon, and/or plastic, or blends thereof. In additional examples, the interior portion of the improved makeup bag includes a hook and loop portion. A pouch is affixable to the hook and loop portion for storage. One or more lipstick products are received by one or more compartments of the pouch for storage. The compartments may be lined with plastic or some other material that can be easily cleaned.</p>
<p id="p-0017" num="0016">Another embodiment of the present invention describes a lipstick stand. The lipstick stand includes a first end disposed opposite a second end. The first end comprises a base component and the second end comprises at least one holder component. A pillar component is disposed between the first end and the second end. In examples, the base component is disposed perpendicular to the pillar component. Additionally, the lipstick stand also includes a fixation means to affix the base component to the pillar component.</p>
<p id="p-0018" num="0017">In examples, a quantity of holder components of the at least one holder component is four. A pouch is detached from an interior of the improved makeup bag and may be received by a holder component of the at least one holder component.</p>

Such embodiments are provided by way of explanation of the present invention, which is not intended to be limited thereto. In fact, those of ordinary skill in the art may appreciate upon reading the present specification and viewing the present drawings that various modifications and variations can be made thereto.</p>
<p id="p-0035" num="0034">An improved makeup bag <b>100</b> is described and depicted herein (e.g., in at least <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref>, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref>, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b></figref>, and <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b></figref>). More specifically, the improved makeup bag <b>100</b> is a multi-functional and portable makeup bag that assists in the organization of cosmetic products. In general, the improved makeup bag <b>100</b> includes a body and an interior portion. Though the improved makeup bag <b>100</b> is depicted with a square shape, it should be appreciated that other shapes are contemplated by this disclosure, such as a triangular shape, a cylindrical shape, a rectangular shape, etc.</p>
<p id="p-0036" num="0035">In some implementations, the improved makeup bag <b>100</b> may have a length of about 8 inches, a width of about 8-8&#xbd; inches, and a height of about 7 inches. It should be appreciated that these dimensions are being provided for illustrative purposes only and other dimensions are contemplated by the instant disclosure. The improved makeup bag <b>100</b> may comprise one or more materials, such as: satin, heavy satin, fabric, cloth, cotton, canvas, mesh, plastic, etc. Moreover, one or more parts or components of the improved makeup bag <b>100</b> may comprise color, patterns, text/writing, or graphics. Furthermore, in some examples, one or more parts or components of the improved makeup bag <b>100</b> may comprise clear or transparent portions to allow a user to easily view a desired cosmetic product or shade of lipstick.</p>
<p id="p-0037" num="0036">As shown in at least <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref>, a fixation means is used to open the improved makeup bag <b>100</b> to expose products housed within the improved makeup bag <b>100</b> or close the improved makeup bag <b>100</b> to maintain the products within the improved makeup bag <b>100</b>. In examples, and as shown in at least <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref>, and <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref>, the fixation means may be a zipper component that is used to open or close the improved makeup bag <b>100</b>. In other examples, the fixation means may include hook and loop, snaps, fasteners, buttons, magnets, hook and loop fasteners, hooks, teeth and groove fasteners, etc., or any other means known to those having ordinary skill in the art. An interior portion of the improved makeup bag <b>100</b> may comprise Velcro (i.e., hook and loop) <b>102</b>, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref>. A pouch <b>110</b> (of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b></figref>, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>6</b></figref>, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>7</b></figref>, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>8</b></figref>, and <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>12</b></figref>) may be affixed by the hook and loop <b>102</b> in the interior portion of the improved makeup bag <b>100</b>. Specifically, the pouch <b>110</b> may comprise numerous compartments <b>106</b> to house makeup or beauty products. Moreover, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>6</b> and <b>12</b></figref>, the pouch <b>110</b> may also comprise an opening <b>302</b> disposed therethrough. The opening may comprise a grommet as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>12</b></figref> that reinforces the opening so that the opening is not easily ripped/torn or mangled/mutilated/disfigured. The grommet may be made of metal or a hard plastic or rubber that has a structural strength able to withstand tearing. The opening and grommet in an embodiment are of a size that allow the grommet and/or opening to fit over the holder component of lipstick stand and allow the pouch to be held by the lipstick stand.</p>
<p id="p-0038" num="0037">The makeup bag may also have a hook on it that allows it to be hung on the lipstick stand of the present invention. The hook can be made of metal, plastic, or rubber. Alternatively, the makeup bag may have a cloth loop that allows it to be attached to the lipstick stand.</p>
<p id="p-0039" num="0038">A size and/or configuration of these compartments <b>106</b> may be identical or may differ. In examples, a first compartment of the compartments <b>106</b> may be about 1 inch in diameter (e.g., configured to hold a mascara product). Further, a second compartment of the compartments <b>106</b> may be about 3 to 4 inches in diameter (e.g., configured to hold a pressed powder product). Additionally, a third compartment of the compartments <b>106</b> may be about 1 inch in diameter (e.g., configured to hold or house an eyeliner product). Other products, such as a tweezer product and a lip balm product, or others, may be housed in one or more of these compartments <b>106</b>. It should be appreciated that a quantity, size, and location of these compartments is being provided for illustrative purposes only and other quantities, sizes, and locations are contemplated by Applicant herein. In a variation, the size may be configured so that one can view the cosmetic that is placed therein (e.g., the size may be of a size that allows the cosmetic placed therein to partially overlap the edge of the compartment so that it can be easily viewed by the user). This will allow the user to quickly procure the cosmetic by a quick look at the one or more compartments. Moreover, in some examples, these compartments may comprise one or more materials, such as: fabric, satin, heavy satin, cloth, cotton, canvas, mesh, plastic, etc., among others not explicitly listed herein. Other parts of the makeup bag may be made by any of these materials including the pouch or the makeup bag. In an embodiment, satin may be used to give the material that is made of satin a glossy look. A heavy satin may be used to give the material not only a glossy look, but also provide the material with tear-resistant strength.</p>
<p id="p-0040" num="0039">Dimensions of the interior of the improved makeup bag <b>100</b> may be about 7 inches in width and about 12 inches in length. It should be appreciated that these dimensions are being provided for illustrative purposes only and other dimensions are contemplated by the instant disclosure. In a variation, the makeup bag <b>100</b> may be larger if one is trying to accommodate items other than or in addition to makeup/cosmetics. In a variation, the makeup bag <b>100</b> may be of a size that allows one to accommodate additional items such as an umbrella, a wallet, or other items that a person may put in a purse or small bag.</p>
<p id="p-0041" num="0040">Further, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b></figref>, an interior portion of the improved makeup bag <b>100</b> may comprise an elastic material <b>108</b> defining a pouch <b>104</b>. The pouch <b>104</b> may be configured to house/hold one or more beauty or cosmetic products.</p>
<p id="p-0042" num="0041">Moreover, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>9</b></figref>-<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>12</b></figref>, the improved makeup bag <b>100</b> may house a lipstick stand <b>200</b> when the lipstick stand <b>200</b> is in a non-use state. In some examples, the lipstick stand <b>200</b> may be affixed to an interior portion of the improved makeup bag <b>100</b> when in the non-use position. The lipstick stand <b>200</b> assists in the organization of various lipsticks and reduces the time it takes for a user to find a desired shade.</p>
<p id="p-0043" num="0042">Specifically, the lipstick stand <b>200</b> comprises a first end disposed opposite a second end and a pillar component <b>204</b> disposed between the first end (e.g., the base component <b>202</b>) and the second end (e.g., the head component <b>206</b>). The pillar component <b>204</b> is substantially cylindrical in shape. The lipstick stand <b>200</b>, at the first end, comprises a base component <b>202</b>, which is disposed perpendicular to the pillar component <b>204</b>. The base component <b>202</b> is substantially planar and circular in shape. A fixation means <b>208</b> (e.g., a screw, a bolt and nut, or similar component) may be used to affix the base component <b>202</b> to the pillar component <b>204</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0044" num="0043">The lipstick stand <b>200</b>, at the second end, comprises at least one holder component <b>210</b>. As depicted in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>9</b></figref> and <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>10</b></figref>, a quantity of the at least one holder component <b>210</b> is four. However, the quantity is not limited to such.</p>
<p id="p-0045" num="0044">Moreover, as shown in at least <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>9</b></figref>, a first holder component of the at least one holder component <b>210</b> is disposed opposite a second holder component of the at least one holder component <b>210</b> and a third holder component of the at least one holder component <b>210</b> is disposed opposite a fourth holder component of the at least one holder component <b>210</b>. As such, as shown in at least <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>9</b></figref>, the holder components form an X-shape. Moreover, each holder component of the at least one holder component <b>210</b> is curved upwards in a direction opposing the base component <b>202</b> so as to hold/maintain an object housed thereon. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>12</b></figref>, the pouch <b>110</b> may be detached and held by a holder component of the at least one holder component <b>210</b>. In an alternate embodiment, the lipstick stand may comprise one or more hooks that allow the makeup bag to be hung wherein the center of gravity is closer to the pillar component. The one or more hooks may be operationally attached to the pillar component. In specific embodiments, the dimensions of the lipstick stand <b>200</b> are about 13&#xd7;23&#xd7;14 cm. However, these dimensions are provided for illustrative purposes only.</p>
<p id="p-0046" num="0045"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>13</b></figref> shows a plurality of embodiments of the present invention wherein the makeup bag <b>100</b> has writing on it. It should be understood that the makeup bag <b>100</b> may have as much writing or as little writing on it as desired. For example, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>14</b></figref> shows the makeup bag <b>100</b> with only a little writing. It should be understood also that designs/drawings may optionally also be present on the exterior of the makeup bag <b>100</b> (as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>), or alternatively, designs/drawings may be present without writing. In a variation, the makeup bag may have writing on the inside of the bag. For example, the user of the makeup bag may have his/her initials on the bag. The writing may be printed or embroidered and/or the writing may use any of a plurality of techniques wherein writing appears on fabrics/plastics.</p>
<p id="p-0047" num="0046"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>15</b></figref> shows the interior of the makeup bag <b>100</b> with a panel <b>1501</b> that comprises a pouch <b>1510</b>, that optionally contains compartments <b>1506</b>, that may be of different sizes. The compartments in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>15</b></figref> as shown in <b>15</b>A are of a size so that the compartments <b>1506</b> are able to accommodate lipstick/mascara or other makeup that is approximately the size of lipstick. But it should be understood that the compartments <b>1506</b> may be of a size or shape to accommodate other makeup. For example, the shape may be of a size and shape that is able to accommodate makeup that is in a round container (for example, blush or rouge). The pouch <b>1510</b> may be attached to the panel <b>1501</b> by means of hook and loop material that is present at location <b>1502</b><i>a</i>. The hook and loop material at location <b>1502</b><i>a </i>will attach to hook and loop material which is present at location <b>1502</b><i>b. </i><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>15</b>B</figref> shows the panel <b>1501</b> in the absence of pouch <b>1510</b> but it shows hook and loop material present at location <b>1502</b><i>b, </i>which allows the attachment of the pouch <b>1510</b> (as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>15</b>A</figref>). It should be understood that panel <b>1501</b> may be a separate panel that can be affixed to the interior of the makeup bag. Alternatively, the panel <b>1501</b> may be the inside of the makeup bag. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>15</b>C</figref> shows the reverse side of panel <b>1501</b> as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>15</b>A</figref>, which may be attached at location <b>1502</b><i>c </i>to the interior of the makeup bag. The means of attachment may be by hook and loop, by sewing, by buttons, by zippers or by other attachment methods. Although <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>15</b>A-<b>15</b>C</figref> show attachment by a single strip of hook and loop, it should be understood that a plurality of hook and loop strips may be used to secure the panel. One advantage to having a panel <b>1501</b> that can be added to the interior of the makeup bag is that a user can change out different panels that may be configured differently based upon the needs of the user. The panels may be different in size so that they can accommodate different amounts of the desired makeup that the user wants to transport.</p>
<p id="p-0048" num="0047">The panel may also have hooks on the panel that allow for one to attach things that are not easily inserted into the compartments but that are configured to be put onto hooks. If hooks are present, they should be of a size that they can fit on the interior of the makeup bag (and that the makeup bag can be closed). The presence of hooks allow items that are attached to the hooks to be seen easily by the user.</p>
