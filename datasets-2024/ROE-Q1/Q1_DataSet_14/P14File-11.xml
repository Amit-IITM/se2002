<heading id="h-0002" level="1">FIELD</heading>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">The present disclosure relates to an article of footwear and more particularly to a sole structure for an article of footwear.</p>
<heading id="h-0003" level="1">BACKGROUND</heading>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">This section provides background information related to the present disclosure which is not necessarily prior art.</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">Articles of footwear conventionally include an upper and a sole structure. The upper may be formed from any suitable material(s) to receive, secure, and support a foot on the sole structure. The upper may cooperate with laces, straps, or other fasteners to adjust the fit of the upper around the foot. A bottom portion of the upper, proximate to a bottom surface of the foot, attaches to the sole structure.</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">Sole structures generally include a layered arrangement extending between a ground surface and the upper. One layer of the sole structure includes an outsole that provides abrasion-resistance and traction with the ground surface. The outsole may be formed from rubber or other materials that impart durability and wear-resistance, as well as enhances traction with the ground surface. Another layer of the sole structure includes a midsole disposed between the outsole and the upper. The midsole provides cushioning for the foot and is generally at least partially formed from a polymer foam material that compresses resiliently under an applied load to cushion the foot by attenuating ground-reaction forces. The midsole may define a bottom surface on one side that opposes the outsole and a footbed on the opposite side that may be contoured to conform to a profile of the bottom surface of the foot. Sole structures may also include a comfort-enhancing insole or a sockliner located within a void proximate to the bottom portion of the upper.</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">In addition to the foregoing elements, sole structures are increasingly incorporating plates that provide the sole structures with increased support and stability during use. Such plates may be disposed at discrete regions of the sole structure to provide localized areas of increased stiffness and support or, alternatively, can be so-called full-length plates that extend continuously between an anterior end of the sole structure and a posterior end of the sole structure and between a medial side of the sole structure and a lateral side of the sole structure.</p>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">While incorporating plates into a sole structure of an article of footwear provides the sole structure and, thus, the article of footwear, with increased support and stability, such plates may increase the stiffness of the sole structure to a point where bending of the sole structure becomes difficult. Further, such plates are often not designed to accommodate other cushions such as, for example, foam blocks or fluid-filled chambers.</p>

<heading id="h-0005" level="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION</heading>
<p id="p-0022" num="0021">Example configurations will now be described more fully with reference to the accompanying drawings. Example configurations are provided so that this disclosure will be thorough, and will fully convey the scope of the disclosure to those of ordinary skill in the art. Specific details are set forth such as examples of specific components, devices, and methods, to provide a thorough understanding of configurations of the present disclosure. It will be apparent to those of ordinary skill in the art that specific details need not be employed, that example configurations may be embodied in many different forms, and that the specific details and the example configurations should not be construed to limit the scope of the disclosure.</p>
<p id="p-0023" num="0022">The terminology used herein is for the purpose of describing particular exemplary configurations only and is not intended to be limiting. As used herein, the singular articles &#x201c;a,&#x201d; &#x201c;an,&#x201d; and &#x201c;the&#x201d; may be intended to include the plural forms as well, unless the context clearly indicates otherwise. The terms &#x201c;comprises,&#x201d; &#x201c;comprising,&#x201d; &#x201c;including,&#x201d; and &#x201c;having,&#x201d; are inclusive and therefore specify the presence of features, steps, operations, elements, and/or components, but do not preclude the presence or addition of one or more other features, steps, operations, elements, components, and/or groups thereof. The method steps, processes, and operations described herein are not to be construed as necessarily requiring their performance in the particular order discussed or illustrated, unless specifically identified as an order of performance. Additional or alternative steps may be employed.</p>
<p id="p-0024" num="0023">When an element or layer is referred to as being &#x201c;on,&#x201d; &#x201c;engaged to,&#x201d; &#x201c;connected to,&#x201d; &#x201c;attached to,&#x201d; or &#x201c;coupled to&#x201d; another element or layer, it may be directly on, engaged, connected, attached, or coupled to the other element or layer, or intervening elements or layers may be present. In contrast, when an element is referred to as being &#x201c;directly on,&#x201d; &#x201c;directly engaged to,&#x201d; &#x201c;directly connected to,&#x201d; &#x201c;directly attached to,&#x201d; or &#x201c;directly coupled to&#x201d; another element or layer, there may be no intervening elements or layers present. Other words used to describe the relationship between elements should be interpreted in a like fashion (e.g., &#x201c;between&#x201d; versus &#x201c;directly between,&#x201d; &#x201c;adjacent&#x201d; versus &#x201c;directly adjacent,&#x201d; etc.). As used herein, the term &#x201c;and/or&#x201d; includes any and all combinations of one or more of the associated listed items.</p>
<p id="p-0025" num="0024">The terms first, second, third, etc. may be used herein to describe various elements, components, regions, layers and/or sections. These elements, components, regions, layers and/or sections should not be limited by these terms. These terms may be only used to distinguish one element, component, region, layer or section from another region, layer or section. Terms such as &#x201c;first,&#x201d; &#x201c;second,&#x201d; and other numerical terms do not imply a sequence or order unless clearly indicated by the context. Thus, a first element, component, region, layer or section discussed below could be termed a second element, component, region, layer or section without departing from the teachings of the example configurations.</p>
<p id="p-0026" num="0025">In one configuration, a sole structure for an article of footwear having an upper is provided. The sole structure includes an outsole defining a ground-contacting surface, a midsole disposed between the outsole and the upper, and a plate attached to the midsole and defining a recess extending in a direction away from the outsole and toward the upper, the recess including a first retainer. The sole structure further includes a first cushion having a first portion received within the recess, the first portion engaging the first retainer to maintain a desired position of the first cushion relative to the plate.</p>
<p id="p-0027" num="0026">The sole structure may include one or more of the following optional features. For example, the first cushion may include a second portion extending from the recess in a direction toward the outsole. Additionally or alternatively, the recess may extend from a medial side of the sole structure to a lateral side of the sole structure. Further, the first retainer may be disposed closer to one of the medial side and the lateral side than the other of the medial side and the lateral side.</p>
<p id="p-0028" num="0027">In one configuration, a second retainer may be disposed within the recess. The first retainer may be disposed adjacent to one of a medial side of the sole structure and a lateral side of the sole structure and the second retainer may be disposed adjacent to the other of the medial side and the lateral side. The first retainer and the second retainer may be aligned with one another across a width of the sole structure. A second cushion may include a first portion received within the recess, whereby the first portion of the second cushion engages the second retainer to maintain a desired position of the second cushion relative to the plate. At least one of the first cushion and the second cushion may be a fluid-filled chamber.</p>
<p id="p-0029" num="0028">The first retainer may be a flange integrally formed with the plate and may extend from a surface of the plate within the recess in a direction toward the outsole.</p>
<p id="p-0030" num="0029">In another configuration, a sole structure for an article of footwear having an upper is provided. The sole structure may include an outsole defining a ground-contacting surface, a midsole disposed between the outsole and the upper, and a plate attached to the midsole and including a first retainer, the first retainer extending from a first surface of the plate in a direction toward the outsole. The sole structure further includes a first cushion opposing the first surface of the plate and engaging the first retainer to maintain a desired position of the first cushion relative to the plate.</p>
<p id="p-0031" num="0030">The sole structure may include one or more of the following optional features. For example, the plate may include a main surface. The first surface may be offset from the main surface in a direction toward the upper to define a recess. The recess may extend from a medial side of the sole structure to a lateral side of the sole structure. Additionally, the first retainer may be disposed closer to one of the medial side and the lateral side than the other of the medial side and the lateral side.</p>
<p id="p-0032" num="0031">A second retainer may extend from the first surface of the plate in a direction toward the outsole. The first retainer may be disposed adjacent to one of a medial side of the sole structure and a lateral side of the sole structure and the second retainer may be disposed adjacent to the other of the medial side and the lateral side. The first retainer and the second retainer may be aligned with one another across a width of the sole structure. A second cushion may oppose the first surface of the plate and may engage the second retainer to maintain a desired position of the second cushion relative to the plate. At least one of the first cushion and the second cushion may be a fluid-filled chamber.</p>
<p id="p-0033" num="0032">The first retainer may be a flange integrally formed with the plate.</p>
<p id="p-0034" num="0033">The details of one or more implementations of the disclosure are set forth in the accompanying drawings and the description below. Other aspects, features, and advantages will be apparent from the description and drawings, and from the claims.</p>

The mid-foot region <b>18</b> may correspond with an arch area of the foot while the heel region <b>20</b> may correspond with rear portions of the foot, including a calcaneus bone. The article of footwear <b>10</b> may additionally include a medial side <b>22</b> and a lateral side <b>24</b> that correspond with opposite sides of the article of footwear <b>10</b> and extend through the regions <b>16</b>, <b>18</b>, <b>20</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0036" num="0035">The upper <b>12</b> includes interior surfaces that define an interior void <b>26</b> that receives and secures a foot for support on the sole structure <b>14</b>. An ankle opening <b>28</b> in the heel region <b>20</b> may provide access to the interior void <b>26</b>. For example, the ankle opening <b>28</b> may receive a foot to secure the foot within the void <b>26</b> and facilitate entry and removal of the foot from and to the interior void <b>26</b>. In some examples, one or more fasteners <b>30</b> extend along the upper <b>12</b> to adjust a fit of the interior void <b>26</b> around the foot while concurrently accommodating entry and removal of the foot therefrom. The upper <b>12</b> may include apertures <b>32</b> such as eyelets and/or other engagement features such as fabric or mesh loops that receive the fasteners <b>30</b>. The fasteners <b>30</b> may include laces, straps, cords, hook-and-loop, or any other suitable type of fastener.</p>
<p id="p-0037" num="0036">The upper <b>12</b> may additionally include a tongue portion <b>34</b> that extends between the interior void <b>26</b> and the fasteners <b>30</b>. The upper <b>12</b> may be formed from one or more materials that are stitched or adhesively bonded together to form the interior void <b>26</b>. Suitable materials of the upper <b>12</b> may include, textiles, foam, leather, and synthetic leather. The materials may be selected and located to impart properties of durability, air-permeability, wear-resistance, flexibility, and comfort to the foot while disposed within the interior void <b>26</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0038" num="0037">The sole structure <b>14</b> is attached to the upper <b>12</b> and provides the article of footwear <b>10</b> with support and cushioning during use. Namely, the sole structure <b>14</b> attenuates ground-reaction forces caused by the article of footwear <b>10</b> striking the ground during use. Accordingly, and as set forth below, the sole structure <b>14</b> may incorporate one or more materials having energy absorbing characteristics to allow the sole structure <b>14</b> to minimize the impact experienced by a user when wearing the article of footwear <b>10</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0039" num="0038">The sole structure <b>14</b> may include a midsole <b>36</b>, an outsole <b>38</b>, a plate <b>40</b>, and one or more cushions <b>42</b> that cooperate with the plate <b>40</b> and the midsole <b>36</b> to provide the sole structure <b>14</b> with support and cushioning during use.</p>
<p id="p-0040" num="0039">With continued reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>1</b>-<b>10</b></figref>, the midsole <b>36</b> is shown as including an upper midsole portion <b>44</b>, a lower, heel midsole portion <b>46</b>, and a lower, forefoot midsole portion <b>48</b>. The upper midsole portion <b>44</b> extends from an anterior end <b>50</b> of the sole structure <b>14</b> to a posterior end <b>52</b> of the sole structure <b>14</b>. Namely, the upper midsole portion <b>44</b> extends continuously from the anterior end <b>50</b> to the posterior end <b>52</b> and between a medial side <b>54</b> of the sole structure <b>14</b> and a lateral side <b>56</b> of the sole structure <b>14</b>. The lower, heel midsole portion <b>46</b> and the lower, forefoot midsole portion <b>48</b> are discrete elements that are separate from one another and from the upper midsole portion <b>44</b>. The lower, heel midsole portion <b>46</b> is disposed in the heel region <b>20</b> and extends from the heel region <b>20</b> to the mid-foot region <b>18</b>. The lower, forefoot midsole portion <b>48</b> is disposed in the forefoot region <b>16</b> and extends from an area proximate to the anterior end <b>50</b> in a direction toward the heel region <b>20</b>. The midsole <b>36</b>&#x2014;including the upper midsole portion <b>44</b>, the lower, heel midsole portion <b>44</b>, and the lower, forefoot midsole portion <b>48</b>&#x2014;may be formed from a material such as, for example, polymer foam. In one configuration, the midsole <b>36</b> opposes a strobel <b>58</b> of the upper <b>12</b> and may extend at least partially onto an upper surface <b>60</b> of the upper <b>12</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>) such that the midsole <b>36</b> covers a junction of the upper <b>12</b> and the strobel <b>58</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0041" num="0040">Forming the midsole <b>36</b> from a compliant, yet resilient material such as polymer foam allows the midsole <b>36</b> to attenuate ground-reaction forces caused by movement of the article of footwear <b>10</b> over ground during use. In addition to attenuating forces associated with use of the article of footwear <b>10</b>, the midsole <b>36</b> may serve to attach the plate <b>40</b> to the upper <b>12</b>. A suitable adhesive (not shown) may be used to attach the midsole <b>36</b> and the strobel <b>58</b>. Alternatively, the plate <b>40</b> may be attached to the midsole <b>36</b> by molding a material of the midsole <b>36</b> directly to the plate <b>40</b>. For example, the plate <b>40</b> may be disposed within a cavity of a mold (not shown) used to form the midsole <b>36</b>. Accordingly, when the midsole <b>36</b> is formed (i.e., by foaming a polymer material), the material of the midsole <b>36</b> is joined to the material of the plate <b>40</b>, thereby forming a unitary structure having both the midsole <b>36</b> and the plate <b>40</b>. Once formed, the midsole <b>36</b>&#x2014;including the plate <b>40</b>&#x2014;can be attached to the strobel <b>58</b> and/or the upper <b>12</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0042" num="0041">As described above, the midsole <b>36</b> is formed of a resilient polymeric material, such as foam or rubber, to impart properties of cushioning, responsiveness, and energy distribution to the foot of the wearer. Example resilient polymeric materials for the midsole <b>36</b> may include those based on foaming or molding one or more polymers, such as one or more elastomers (e.g., thermoplastic elastomers (TPE)). The one or more polymers may include aliphatic polymers, aromatic polymers, or mixtures of both; and may include homopolymers, copolymers (including terpolymers), or mixtures of both.</p>
<p id="p-0043" num="0042">In some aspects, the one or more polymers may include olefinic homopolymers, olefinic copolymers, or blends thereof. Examples of olefinic polymers include polyethylene, polypropylene, and combinations thereof. In other aspects, the one or more polymers may include one or more ethylene copolymers, such as, ethylene-vinyl acetate (EVA) copolymers, EVOH copolymers, ethylene-ethyl acrylate copolymers, ethylene-unsaturated mono-fatty acid copolymers, and combinations thereof.</p>
<p id="p-0044" num="0043">In further aspects, the one or more polymers may include one or more polyacrylates, such as polyacrylic acid, esters of polyacrylic acid, polyacrylonitrile, polyacrylic acetate, polymethyl acrylate, polyethyl acrylate, polybutyl acrylate, polymethyl methacrylate, and polyvinyl acetate; including derivatives thereof, copolymers thereof, and any combinations thereof.</p>
<p id="p-0045" num="0044">In yet further aspects, the one or more polymers may include one or more ionomeric polymers. In these aspects, the ionomeric polymers may include polymers with carboxylic acid functional groups, sulfonic acid functional groups, salts thereof (e.g., sodium, magnesium, potassium, etc.), and/or anhydrides thereof. For instance, the ionomeric polymer(s) may include one or more fatty acid-modified ionomeric polymers, polystyrene sulfonate, ethylene-methacrylic acid copolymers, and combinations thereof.</p>
<p id="p-0046" num="0045">In further aspects, the one or more polymers may include one or more styrenic block copolymers, such as acrylonitrile butadiene styrene block copolymers, styrene acrylonitrile block copolymers, styrene ethylene butylene styrene block copolymers, styrene ethylene butadiene styrene block copolymers, styrene ethylene propylene styrene block copolymers, styrene butadiene styrene block copolymers, and combinations thereof.</p>
<p id="p-0047" num="0046">In further aspects, the one or more polymers may include one or more polyamide copolymers (e.g., polyamide-polyether copolymers) and/or one or more polyurethanes (e.g., cross-linked polyurethanes and/or thermoplastic polyurethanes). Examples of suitable polyurethanes include those discussed below for barrier elements of the cushions <b>42</b>. Alternatively, the one or more polymers may include one or more natural and/or synthetic rubbers, such as butadiene and isoprene.</p>
<p id="p-0048" num="0047">When the resilient polymeric material is a foamed polymeric material, the foamed material may be foamed using a physical blowing agent which phase transitions to a gas based on a change in temperature and/or pressure, or a chemical blowing agent which forms a gas when heated above its activation temperature. For example, the chemical blowing agent may be an azo compound such as azodicarbonamide, sodium bicarbonate, and/or an isocyanate.</p>
<p id="p-0049" num="0048">In some embodiments, the foamed polymeric material may be a crosslinked foamed material. In these embodiments, a peroxide-based crosslinking agent such as dicumyl peroxide may be used. Furthermore, the foamed polymeric material may include one or more fillers such as pigments, modified or natural clays, modified or unmodified synthetic clays, talc glass fiber, powdered glass, modified or natural silica, calcium carbonate, mica, paper, wood chips, and the like.</p>
<p id="p-0050" num="0049">The resilient polymeric material may be formed using a molding process. In one example, when the resilient polymeric material is a molded elastomer, the uncured elastomer (e.g., rubber) may be mixed in a Banbury mixer with an optional filler and a curing package such as a sulfur-based or peroxide-based curing package, calendared, formed into shape, placed in a mold, and vulcanized.</p>
<p id="p-0051" num="0050">In another example, when the resilient polymeric material is a foamed material, the material may be foamed during a molding process, such as an injection molding process. A thermoplastic polymeric material may be melted in the barrel of an injection molding system and combined with a physical or chemical blowing agent and optionally a crosslinking agent, and then injected into a mold under conditions which activate the blowing agent, forming a molded foam.</p>
<p id="p-0052" num="0051">Optionally, when the resilient polymeric material is a foamed material, the foamed material may be a compression molded foam. Compression molding may be used to alter the physical properties (e.g., density, stiffness and/or durometer) of a foam, or to alter the physical appearance of the foam (e.g., to fuse two or more pieces of foam, to shape the foam, etc.), or both.</p>
<p id="p-0053" num="0052">The compression molding process desirably starts by forming one or more foam preforms, such as by injection molding and foaming a polymeric material, by forming foamed particles or beads, by cutting foamed sheet stock, and the like. The compression molded foam may then be made by placing the one or more preforms formed of foamed polymeric material(s) in a compression mold, and applying sufficient pressure to the one or more preforms to compress the one or more preforms in a closed mold. Once the mold is closed, sufficient heat and/or pressure is applied to the one or more preforms in the closed mold for a sufficient duration of time to alter the preform(s) by forming a skin on the outer surface of the compression molded foam, fuse individual foam particles to each other, permanently increase the density of the foam(s), or any combination thereof. Following the heating and/or application of pressure, the mold is opened and the molded foam article is removed from the mold.</p>
<p id="p-0054" num="0053">While the various components of the midsole <b>36</b> may be formed from different materials and by different processes than one another, the upper midsole portion <b>44</b>, the lower, heel midsole portion <b>46</b>, and the lower, forefoot midsole portion <b>48</b> will be described as being formed from the same polymer foam material. With particular reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>6</b> and <b>7</b></figref>, the upper midsole portion <b>44</b> is shown as extending along an entire length and width of the sole structure <b>14</b> between the anterior end <b>50</b> and the posterior end <b>52</b> and between the medial side <b>54</b> and the lateral side <b>56</b>. As such, the upper midsole portion <b>44</b> extends substantially uninterrupted between the anterior end <b>50</b> and the posterior end <b>52</b> and between the medial side <b>54</b> and the lateral side <b>56</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0055" num="0054">The upper midsole portion <b>44</b> includes an upper surface <b>62</b> that opposes the strobel <b>58</b> as well a peripheral lip <b>64</b> extending substantially continuously around an outer perimeter of the upper midsole portion <b>44</b>. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>, the peripheral lip <b>64</b> extends in a direction toward the upper <b>12</b> and extends onto a portion of the upper surface <b>60</b> of the upper <b>12</b>. In so doing, the peripheral lip <b>64</b> covers a junction of the upper <b>12</b> and the strobel <b>58</b> once the sole structure <b>14</b> is attached to the upper <b>12</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0056" num="0055">The upper midsole portion <b>44</b> additionally includes a bottom surface <b>66</b>, a first recessed surface <b>68</b>, and a second recessed surface <b>70</b> all disposed on an opposite side of the upper midsole portion <b>44</b> then the upper surface <b>62</b>. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>7</b></figref>, the first recessed surface <b>68</b> and the second recessed surface <b>70</b> are offset from the bottom surface <b>66</b> in a direction toward the upper <b>12</b>. The first recessed surface <b>68</b> includes an arcuate portion <b>72</b> disposed proximate to a heel region of the upper midsole portion <b>44</b> and extending from the medial side <b>54</b> of the sole structure <b>14</b> to the lateral side <b>56</b> of the sole structure <b>14</b>, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>7</b></figref>. The arcuate portion <b>72</b> extends from the heel region of the upper midsole portion <b>44</b> to a lateral portion <b>74</b> of the first recessed surface <b>68</b>. The lateral portion <b>74</b> of the first recessed surface <b>68</b> extends from the heel region, along a portion of the lateral side <b>56</b> of the sole structure <b>14</b> to a main portion <b>76</b> of the first recessed surface <b>68</b>. The main portion <b>76</b> of the first recessed surface <b>68</b> extends from the mid-foot region <b>18</b> to the forefoot region <b>16</b> and is interrupted by the second recessed portion <b>70</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0057" num="0056">As described, the second recessed surface interrupts the main portion <b>76</b> of the first recessed surface <b>68</b> such that the main portion <b>76</b> is discontinuous in a direction extending from the mid-foot region <b>18</b> to the forefoot region <b>16</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0058" num="0057">The second recessed surface <b>70</b> is disposed within a recess <b>78</b> that is offset from the first recessed surface <b>68</b> at the main portion <b>76</b> in a direction toward the upper <b>12</b>. As such, the second recessed surface <b>70</b> is disposed closer to the upper <b>12</b> than the first recessed surface <b>68</b>. The recess <b>78</b> includes a depth measured from the main portion <b>76</b> of the first recessed surface <b>68</b> to the second recessed surface <b>70</b> disposed within the recess <b>78</b>. A pair of arcuate sidewalls <b>80</b> extend from the main portion <b>76</b> of the first recessed surface <b>68</b> to the second recessed surface <b>70</b>. The arcuate sidewalls <b>80</b> oppose one another across a width of the recess <b>78</b> measured in a direction substantially parallel to a longitudinal axis of the upper midsole portion <b>44</b>. Each of the arcuate sidewalls <b>80</b> taper in a direction extending from the first recessed surface <b>68</b> to the second recessed surface <b>70</b>. Further, each arcuate sidewall <b>80</b> extends continuously and uninterrupted from the medial side <b>54</b> to the lateral side <b>56</b> and each includes a non-linear shape. For example, and as best shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>7</b></figref>, each of the arcuate sidewalls <b>80</b> includes a serpentine shape extending from a first end disposed at the medial side <b>54</b> of the sole structure <b>14</b> to the lateral side <b>56</b> of the sole structure <b>14</b>. As shown, the recess <b>78</b> includes a greater width proximate to the medial side <b>54</b> and the lateral side <b>56</b> than a central portion of the recess <b>78</b> disposed generally proximate to a midpoint of the upper midsole portion <b>44</b>. Specifically, the serpentine shape of the arcuate sidewalls <b>80</b> creates an area of reduced width <b>82</b> that is substantially centered between the medial side <b>54</b> of the sole structure <b>14</b> and the lateral side <b>56</b> of the sole structure <b>14</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0059" num="0058">The lower, heel midsole portion <b>46</b> and the lower, forefoot midsole portion <b>48</b> are disposed on an opposite side of the plate <b>40</b> than the upper midsole portion <b>44</b>. The lower, heel midsole portion <b>46</b> includes an upper surface <b>84</b> and a lower surface <b>86</b> disposed on an opposite side of the lower, heel midsole portion <b>46</b> than the upper surface <b>84</b>. The upper surface <b>84</b> extends from the posterior end <b>52</b> within the heel region <b>20</b> of the sole structure <b>14</b> in a direction toward the mid-foot region <b>18</b>. In one configuration, the upper surface <b>84</b> extends continuously from the posterior end <b>52</b> within the heel region <b>20</b> and terminates proximate to a junction of the forefoot region <b>16</b> and the mid-foot region <b>18</b>. The upper surface <b>84</b> is substantially flat and opposes the plate <b>40</b> once the sole structure <b>14</b> is assembled. The substantially flat upper surface <b>84</b> of the lower, heel midsole portion <b>46</b> is convergent with the lower surface <b>86</b> and, as such, provides the lower, heel midsole portion <b>46</b> with a thickness that tapers in a direction from the heel region <b>20</b> to the forefoot region <b>16</b>. Accordingly, the lower, heel midsole portion <b>46</b> includes a thickness that is greatest proximate to the posterior end <b>52</b> and thinnest proximate to the mid-foot region <b>18</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0060" num="0059">The lower surface <b>86</b> is disposed on an opposite side of the lower, heel midsole portion <b>46</b> than the upper surface <b>84</b> and opposes the outsole <b>38</b>. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>7</b></figref>, the lower surface <b>86</b> includes a pair of depressions <b>88</b> and a pair of dimples <b>90</b>. The depressions <b>88</b> extend into the lower, heel midsole portion <b>46</b> in a direction toward the upper surface <b>84</b> and serve to provide the lower, heel midsole portion <b>46</b> with localized areas of reduced thickness. Similarly, the dimples <b>90</b> extend into a thickness of the lower, heel midsole portion <b>46</b> in a direction toward the upper surface <b>84</b> and are spaced apart and separated from one another. The dimples <b>90</b> are formed at an outer perimeter of the lower, heel midsole portion <b>46</b> and extend onto a sidewall <b>92</b> of the lower, heel midsole portion <b>46</b>. The depressions <b>88</b> and dimples <b>90</b> provide the lower, heel midsole portion <b>46</b> with areas of reduced thickness and, thus, allow the lower, midsole portion <b>46</b> to more easily bend in these localized areas.</p>
<p id="p-0061" num="0060">The lower, heel midsole portion <b>46</b> additionally includes an arcuate sidewall <b>94</b> disposed on an opposite end of the lower, heel midsole portion <b>46</b> than the portion of the lower, heel midsole portion <b>46</b> disposed proximate to the posterior end <b>52</b>. The arcuate sidewall <b>94</b> extends between the medial side <b>54</b> of the sole structure <b>14</b> and the lateral side <b>56</b> of the sole structure <b>14</b> and extends from the upper surface <b>84</b> to the lower surface <b>86</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0062" num="0061">The arcuate sidewall <b>94</b> includes a substantially similar shape as the arcuate sidewall <b>80</b> of the recess <b>78</b>. As such, the arcuate sidewall <b>94</b> mimics the arcuate sidewall <b>80</b> of the recess <b>78</b> such that when the lower, heel midsole portion <b>46</b> is positioned relative to the recess <b>78</b> of the upper midsole portion <b>44</b>, the arcuate sidewall <b>94</b> of the lower, heel midsole portion <b>46</b> is aligned with the arcuate sidewall <b>80</b> of the upper midsole portion <b>44</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0063" num="0062">The lower, forefoot midsole portion <b>48</b> is disposed on an opposite side of the recess <b>78</b> than the lower, heel midsole portion <b>46</b>. As with the lower, heel midsole portion <b>46</b>, the lower, forefoot midsole portion <b>48</b> includes a first surface <b>96</b> that opposes the plate <b>40</b> and a second surface <b>98</b> formed on an opposite side of the lower, forefoot midsole portion <b>48</b> than the first surface <b>96</b>. The lower, forefoot midsole portion <b>48</b> tapers in a direction from a portion of the lower, forefoot midsole portion <b>48</b> disposed proximate to the recess <b>78</b> to a portion of the lower, forefoot midsole portion <b>48</b> disposed proximate to the anterior end <b>50</b>.

<p id="p-0064" num="0063">The arcuate sidewall <b>100</b> opposes the arcuate sidewall <b>94</b> of the lower, heel midsole portion <b>46</b> when the lower, forefoot midsole portion <b>48</b> is attached to the plate <b>40</b>. As such, the arcuate sidewall <b>100</b> is positioned proximate to the recess <b>78</b> and opposes the arcuate sidewall <b>94</b> across the recess <b>78</b>. As will be described in greater detail below, the plate <b>40</b> extends across and covers the recess <b>78</b> of the upper midsole portion <b>44</b> in an area between the arcuate sidewalls <b>94</b>, <b>100</b>. However, the arcuate sidewall <b>94</b> of the lower, heel midsole portion <b>46</b> nonetheless opposes the arcuate sidewall <b>100</b> of the lower, midsole portion <b>48</b> across the recess <b>78</b> of the upper midsole portion <b>44</b> when the sole assembly <b>14</b> is assembled.</p>
<p id="p-0065" num="0064">The arcuate sidewall <b>100</b> includes a serpentine shape that extends continuously from the medial side <b>54</b> of the sole structure <b>14</b> to the lateral side <b>56</b> of the sole structure <b>14</b>.

<p id="p-0066" num="0065">With particular reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>6</b> and <b>7</b></figref>, the plate <b>40</b> is shown as being disposed between the various elements <b>44</b>, <b>46</b>, <b>48</b> of the midsole <b>36</b> and, as such, provides the midsole <b>36</b> with a degree of support and stability. The plate <b>40</b> may be formed from a relatively rigid material&#x2014;a material having a greater rigidity than a material of at least one of the elements <b>44</b>, <b>46</b>, <b>48</b> of the midsole <b>36</b>. For example, the plate <b>40</b> may be formed from a non-foamed polymer material or, alternatively, from a composite material containing fibers such as carbon fibers. Forming the plate <b>40</b> from a relatively rigid material allows the plate <b>40</b> to distribute forces associated with use of the article footwear <b>10</b> when the article of footwear <b>10</b> is in contact with a ground surface, as will be described in greater detail below.</p>
<p id="p-0067" num="0066">In some examples, the plate <b>40</b> includes a uniform local stiffness (e.g., tensile strength or flexural strength) throughout the entire surface area of the plate <b>40</b>. The stiffness of the plate may be anisotropic where the stiffness in one direction across the plate <b>40</b> is different from the stiffness in another direction. For instance, the plate <b>40</b> may be formed from at least two layers of fibers anisotropic to one another to impart gradient stiffness and gradient load paths across the plate <b>40</b>. In one configuration, the plate <b>40</b> is formed from one or more layers of tows of fibers and/or layers of fibers including at least one of carbon fibers, aramid fibers, boron fibers, glass fibers, and polymer fibers. In a particular configuration, the fibers include carbon fibers, or glass fibers, or a combination of both carbon fibers and glass fibers. The tows of fibers may be affixed to a substrate. The tows of fibers may be affixed by stitching or using an adhesive. Additionally or alternatively, the tows of fibers and/or layers of fibers may be consolidated with a thermoset polymer and/or a thermoplastic polymer. Accordingly, the plate <b>40</b> may have a tensile strength or flexural strength in a transverse direction substantially perpendicular to the longitudinal axis L. The stiffness of the plate <b>40</b> may be selected for a particular wearer based on the wearer's shoe size, body mass, running speed, or optimized ankle torque profile. Moreover, the stiffness of the plate <b>40</b> may also be tailored based upon a running motion of the athlete. In other configurations, the plate <b>40</b> is formed from one or more layers/plies of unidirectional tape. In some examples, each layer in the stack includes a different orientation than the layer disposed underneath. The plate <b>40</b> may be formed from unidirectional tape including at least one of carbon fibers, aramid fibers, boron fibers, glass fibers, and polymer fibers. In some examples, the one or more materials forming the plate <b>40</b> include a Young's modulus of at least 10a gigapascals (GPa).</p>
<p id="p-0068" num="0067">In some implementations, the plate <b>40</b> includes a substantially uniform thickness ranging from about 0.6 millimeter (mm) to about 5.0 mm. In one example, the thickness of the plate <b>40</b> is substantially equal to one 1.0 mm. In other implementations, the thickness of the plate <b>40</b> is non-uniform such that the plate <b>40</b> may define a greater thickness in different regions of the sole structure <b>14</b>. The plate <b>40</b> may be constructed, as described in U.S. Application Serial No. <b>15</b>/<b>248</b>,<b>051</b> and U.S. Application Serial No. <b>15</b>/<b>248</b>,<b>059</b>, which are hereby incorporated by reference in their entireties.</p>
<p id="p-0069" num="0068">Regardless of the materials used to form the plate <b>40</b>, the plate <b>40</b> may be a so-called &#x201c;full-length plate&#x201d; that extends from the anterior end <b>50</b> to the posterior end <b>52</b>. Allowing the plate <b>40</b> to extend from the anterior end <b>50</b> to the posterior end <b>52</b> causes the plate <b>40</b> to extend from the forefoot region <b>16</b> through the mid-foot region <b>18</b> and to the heel region <b>20</b>. While the plate <b>40</b> may be a full-length plate that extends from the forefoot region <b>16</b> to the heel region <b>20</b>, the plate <b>40</b> could alternatively extend through only a portion of the sole structure <b>14</b>. For example, the plate <b>40</b> may extend from the anterior end <b>50</b> of the sole structure <b>14</b> to the mid-foot region <b>18</b> without extending fully through the mid-foot region <b>18</b> and into the heel region <b>20</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0070" num="0069">With particular reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>6</b> and <b>7</b></figref>, the Plate <b>40</b> includes a main body <b>102</b> extending between a first end <b>104</b> and a second end <b>106</b>. The first end <b>104</b> is disposed proximate to the anterior end <b>50</b> of the sole structure <b>14</b> and the second end <b>106</b> is disposed proximate to the posterior end <b>52</b> of the sole structure <b>14</b>. The plate <b>40</b> additionally includes a recess <b>108</b> disposed along a length of the main body <b>102</b>, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>6</b> and <b>7</b></figref>. The recess <b>108</b> is formed into the main body <b>102</b> in a direction toward the upper <b>12</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0071" num="0070">The main body <b>102</b> includes a substantially hook-like shape or C-shape at the second end <b>106</b>. The C-shape of the plate <b>40</b> at the second end <b>106</b> defines a gap <b>110</b> in the Plate <b>40</b>. In this region, the bottom surface <b>66</b> of the upper midsole portion <b>44</b> opposes and is secured to the upper surface <b>84</b> of the lower, heel midsole portion <b>46</b> while the plate <b>40</b> itself is received by the recessed surface <b>68</b> of the upper midsole portion <b>44</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0072" num="0071">In use, the gap <b>110</b> serves to locally weaken the plate <b>40</b> in the area of the heel region <b>20</b>, thereby allowing the heel region <b>20</b> to more easily flex when subjected to a force such as, for example, during a walking and/or running movement. Namely, the gap <b>110</b> serves to effectively remove a portion of the plate <b>40</b> in the heel region <b>20</b>, thereby decreasing the amount of material of the plate <b>40</b> at the heel region <b>20</b> when compared to the forefoot regions <b>16</b> of the plate <b>40</b>. The reduced material of the plate <b>40</b> within the heel region <b>20</b> allows the heel region <b>20</b> to more easily bend and flex during walking and/or running movements.</p>
<p id="p-0073" num="0072">The heel region of the plate <b>40</b> includes an arcuate portion <b>112</b> extending along the heel region at the second end <b>106</b> of the plate <b>40</b> and between a lateral portion <b>114</b> and a medial portion <b>116</b>. The lateral portion <b>114</b> extends continuously from the forefoot region <b>16</b>, through the mid-foot region <b>18</b>, and to the heel region <b>20</b> where the lateral portion <b>114</b> is joined to the arcuate portion <b>112</b>. The medial portion <b>116</b> extends from the arcuate portion <b>112</b> in a direction toward the mid-foot region <b>18</b> and terminates at a distal end <b>118</b>. The distal end <b>118</b> tapers to a point <b>120</b> disposed in an area generally between the heel region <b>20</b> and the mid-foot region <b>18</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0074" num="0073">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>6</b> and <b>7</b></figref>, the lateral portion <b>114</b> of the plate <b>40</b> generally increases in width from the arcuate portion <b>112</b> in a direction toward the forefoot region <b>116</b>. The plate <b>40</b> continues to increase in width&#x2014;as measured in a direction from the lateral side <b>56</b> to the medial side <b>54</b>&#x2014;until reaching a maximum width at the recess <b>108</b>. The main body <b>102</b> maintains the maximum width in a direction from the medial side <b>54</b> to the lateral side <b>56</b> at the recess <b>108</b> and then tapers from the recess <b>108</b> to the first end <b>104</b> in a direction toward the anterior end <b>50</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0075" num="0074">With particular reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>7</b></figref>, the recess <b>108</b> is shown as extending continuously from the medial side <b>54</b> to the lateral side <b>56</b>. The recess <b>108</b> includes a bottom surface <b>122</b> that is offset from the main body <b>102</b>. Specifically, the bottom surface <b>122</b> is offset from the main body <b>102</b> in a direction toward the upper <b>12</b> such that the bottom surface <b>122</b> of the recess <b>108</b> is disposed closer to the upper <b>12</b> than the main body <b>102</b>. The bottom surface <b>122</b> of the recess <b>108</b> likewise extends continuously from the medial side <b>54</b> to the lateral side <b>56</b> and terminates at the medial side <b>54</b> and the lateral side <b>56</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0076" num="0075">A pair of arcuate sidewalls <b>124</b> extend from the main body <b>102</b> of the plate <b>40</b> to the bottom surface <b>122</b>. As such, the arcuate sidewalls <b>124</b> cooperate with the bottom surface <b>122</b> to generally define the overall shape of the recess <b>108</b>. As with the arcuate sidewalls <b>94</b> of the lower, heel midsole portion <b>46</b> and the arcuate sidewalls <b>100</b> of the lower, forefoot midsole portion <b>48</b>, the arcuate sidewalls <b>124</b> of the recess <b>108</b> each include a substantially serpentine configuration extending continuously from the medial side <b>54</b> to the lateral side <b>56</b>. The serpentine shape of the arcuate sidewalls <b>124</b> follows the shape of the arcuate sidewalls <b>94</b> of the lower, heel midsole portion <b>46</b>. As such, the arcuate sidewalls <b>124</b> of the recess <b>108</b> likewise follow the shape of the arcuate sidewalls <b>80</b> of the upper midsole portion <b>44</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0077" num="0076">The shape of the arcuate sidewalls <b>124</b> of the recess <b>108</b> and the shape of the bottom surface <b>122</b> cooperate to provide the recess <b>108</b> with a similar shape as the recess <b>78</b> formed in the upper midsole portion <b>44</b>. Providing the recess <b>108</b> of the plate <b>40</b> with a similar shape as the recess <b>78</b> of the upper midsole portion <b>44</b> allows the structure of the plate <b>40</b> forming the recess <b>108</b> to be matingly received by the recess <b>78</b> of the upper midsole portion <b>44</b>. In so doing, the plate <b>40</b> may be in contact with the second recess surface <b>70</b> within the recess <b>78</b> of the upper midsole portion <b>44</b> when the plate <b>40</b> is received by the upper midsole portion <b>44</b>, as best shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>10</b> and <b>11</b></figref>.</p>

Namely, and as set forth below, the retainers <b>126</b> include a shape that is similar to that of the cushions <b>42</b> to allow the retainers <b>126</b> to matingly engage the cushions <b>42</b> and maintain a desired position of the cushions <b>42</b> relative to the plate <b>40</b>. Additionally, the retainers <b>126</b> engage the cushions <b>42</b> in an effort to control the degree to which the cushions <b>42</b> expand when subjected to a force during running and/or walking movements. Specifically, the cushions <b>42</b> are separated from one another in a direction extending between the medial side <b>54</b> and the lateral side <b>56</b> and, as such, are permitted to flex and move toward one another when subject to an applied load. Similarly, the cushions <b>42</b> are spaced apart and separated from the sidewalls <b>124</b> of the plate <b>40</b> and, as such, are likewise permitted to flex and move toward the sidewalls <b>124</b> when subjected to an applied load. The retainers <b>126</b>&#x2014;by engaging an outer surface of the cushions <b>42</b> within the recess <b>108</b> and having a higher rigidity than the cushions <b>42</b>&#x2014;can help prevent the cushions <b>42</b> from moving toward one another and/or toward the sidewalls <b>124</b> beyond a predetermined amount. For example, the retainers <b>126</b> can engage sidewalls of the cushions <b>42</b> to reinforce and support the sidewalls during loading of the cushions <b>42</b>.</p>

Namely, the arcuate portion <b>112</b> of the plate <b>40</b> extends from the junction of the upper midsole portion <b>44</b> and the lower, heel midsole portion <b>46</b> at the heel region <b>20</b>. As such, portions of the arcuate portion <b>112</b>, the lateral portion <b>114</b>, and the medial portion <b>116</b> of the plate <b>40</b> are exposed at the heel region <b>20</b>.

The first barrier element <b>138</b> and the second barrier element <b>140</b> may be formed from a sheet of thermoplastic polyurethane (TPU). Specifically, the first barrier element <b>138</b> may be formed from a sheet of TPU material and may include a substantially planar shape. The second barrier element <b>140</b> may likewise be formed from a sheet of TPU material and may be formed into the configuration shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>7</b></figref> to define an interior void <b>142</b>. The first barrier element <b>138</b> may be joined to the second barrier element <b>140</b> by applying heat and pressure at a perimeter of the first barrier element <b>138</b> and the second barrier element <b>140</b> to define a peripheral seam <b>144</b>. The peripheral seam <b>144</b> seals the internal interior void <b>142</b>, thereby defining a volume of the first fluid-filled chamber <b>134</b> and the second fluid-filled chamber <b>136</b>.</p>

The upper tensile sheet <b>150</b> may be attached to the second barrier element <b>140</b> while the lower tensile sheet <b>152</b> may be attached to the first barrier element <b>138</b>. In this manner, when the first fluid-filled chamber <b>134</b> and the second fluid-filled chamber <b>136</b> receives a pressurized fluid, the tensile strands <b>148</b> of the tensile elements <b>146</b> are placed in tension. Because the upper tensile sheet <b>150</b> is attached to the second barrier element <b>140</b> and the lower tensile sheet <b>152</b> is attached to the first barrier element <b>138</b>, the tensile strands <b>148</b> retain a desired shape of the first fluid-filled chamber <b>134</b> and a desired shape of the second fluid-filled chamber <b>136</b> when the pressurized fluid is injected into the interior void <b>142</b>.</p>

The foam blocks may be received within the interior void <b>142</b> defined by the first barrier element <b>138</b> and the second barrier element <b>140</b>. Positioning the foam blocks within the interior void <b>142</b> defined by the first barrier element <b>138</b> and the second barrier element <b>140</b> allows the barrier elements <b>138</b>, <b>140</b> to restrict expansion of the foam blocks beyond a predetermined amount when subjected to a predetermined load. Accordingly, the overall shape and, thus, the performance of the foam blocks may be controlled by allowing the foam blocks to interact with the barrier elements <b>138</b>, <b>140</b> during loading. While the foam blocks are described as being received within the interior void <b>142</b> of the barrier elements <b>138</b>, <b>140</b>, the foam blocks could alternatively be positioned within the recess <b>108</b> at the retainers <b>126</b> absent the barrier elements <b>138</b>, <b>140</b>.

In comparison, for an opaque barrier element, light does not pass through the barrier element and one cannot see clearly through the barrier element at all. A translucent barrier element falls between a transparent barrier element and an opaque barrier element, in that light passes through a translucent element but some of the light is scattered so that a viewer cannot see clearly through the element.</p>

In other aspects, the chambers <b>134</b>, <b>136</b> can alternatively include other media, such as pellets, beads, ground recycled material, and the like (e.g., foamed beads and/or rubber beads). The fluid provided to the chambers <b>134</b>, <b>136</b> can result in the chambers <b>134</b>, <b>136</b> being pressurized. Alternatively, the fluid provided to the chambers <b>134</b>, <b>136</b> can be at atmospheric pressure such that the chambers <b>134</b>, <b>136</b> are not pressurized but, rather, simply contain a volume of fluid at atmospheric pressure.</p>
<p id="p-0098" num="0097">The chambers <b>134</b>, <b>136</b> desirably have a low gas transmission rate to preserve their retained gas pressure. In some embodiments, the chambers <b>134</b>, <b>136</b> have a gas transmission rate for nitrogen gas that is at least about ten (10) times lower than a nitrogen gas transmission rate for a butyl rubber layer of substantially the same dimensions. In an aspect, the chambers <b>134</b>, <b>136</b> have a nitrogen gas transmission rate of 15 cubic-centimeter/square-meter&#xb7;atmosphere&#xb7;day (cm<sup>3</sup>/m<sup>2</sup>&#xb7;atm&#xb7;day) or less for an average film thickness of 500 micrometers (based on thicknesses of barrier elements <b>138</b>, <b>140</b>). In further aspects, the transmission rate is <b>10</b> cm<sup>3</sup>/m<sup>2</sup>&#xb7;atm&#xb7;day or less, 5 cm<sup>3</sup>/m<sup>2</sup>&#xb7;atm&#xb7;day or less, or 1 cm<sup>3</sup>/m<sup>2</sup>&#xb7;atm&#xb7;day or less.</p>
<p id="p-0099" num="0098">In some implementations, the upper and lower barrier elements <b>138</b>, <b>140</b> are formed by respective mold portions each defining various surfaces for forming depressions and pinched surfaces corresponding to locations where the peripheral seam <b>144</b> is formed when the upper barrier element <b>138</b> and the lower barrier element <b>140</b> are joined and bonded together. In some implementations, adhesive bonding joins the upper barrier element <b>138</b> and the lower barrier element <b>140</b> to form a web area <b>154</b> and the peripheral seam <b>144</b>. In other implementations, the upper barrier element <b>138</b> and the lower barrier element <b>140</b> are joined to form the web area <b>154</b> and the peripheral seam <b>144</b> by thermal bonding. In some examples, one or both of the barrier elements <b>138</b>, <b>140</b> are heated to a temperature that facilitates shaping and melding. In some examples, the barrier elements <b>138</b>, <b>140</b> are heated prior to being located between their respective molds. In other examples, the mold may be heated to raise the temperature of the barrier elements <b>138</b>, <b>140</b>. In some implementations, a molding process used to form the fluid-filled chambers <b>134</b>, <b>136</b> incorporates vacuum ports within mold portions to remove air such that the upper and lower barrier elements <b>138</b>, <b>140</b> are drawn into contact with respective mold portions. In other implementations, fluids such as air may be injected into areas between the upper and lower barrier elements <b>138</b>, <b>140</b> such that pressure increases cause the barrier elements <b>138</b>, <b>140</b> to engage with surfaces of their respective mold portions.</p>
<p id="p-0100" num="0099">With particular reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>6</b> and <b>7</b></figref>, the outsole <b>38</b> is shown as including various discrete segments that are received by and attached to the midsole <b>36</b>. Namely, the outsole <b>38</b> includes various segments that are attached to portions of the lower, heel midsole portion <b>46</b> and the lower, forefoot midsole portion <b>48</b> and include traction elements <b>156</b> to facilitate gripping a ground surface during use. In one configuration, a forward-most portion of the outsole <b>38</b> includes a pair of recesses <b>158</b> that respectively receive the cushions <b>42</b>. The recesses <b>158</b> are spaced apart from one another across a width of the outsole <b>38</b>, are vertically aligned with the retainers <b>126</b> of the plate <b>40</b>, and serve to retain and position the cushions <b>42</b> relative to the outsole <b>38</b> and, thus, the upper <b>12</b>. In one configuration, a material of the cushions <b>42</b> may be melded to bond the cushions <b>42</b> to the outsole <b>38</b> within the recesses <b>158</b>. In other configurations, an adhesive may be used to bond the cushions <b>42</b> within the recesses <b>158</b> to secure a desired position of the cushions <b>42</b> relative to and within the recesses <b>158</b>. While the outsole <b>38</b> is described and shown as including various discrete and individual segments that are respectively attached to the cushions <b>42</b>, the lower, heel midsole portion <b>46</b>, and the lower, forefoot midsole portion <b>48</b>, the outsole <b>38</b> could alternatively include a unitary construction having a single number that is attached to the cushions <b>42</b>, the lower, heel midsole portion <b>46</b>, and the lower, forefoot midsole portion <b>48</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0101" num="0100">In operation, when the sole structure <b>14</b> is subjected to a force during running and/or walking movements, the plate <b>40</b> provides a degree of strength and stability to the sole structure <b>14</b>. Further, the plate <b>40</b> serves to position the cushions <b>42</b> in a desired relationship relative to the upper <b>12</b> by positioning the cushions <b>42</b> in close proximity to the upper <b>12</b>. Namely, the portion of the plate <b>40</b> formed by the recess <b>108</b> is permitted to be moved into close proximity to the upper <b>12</b> due to the recess <b>78</b> formed in the upper midsole portion <b>44</b>. Accordingly, when the cushions <b>42</b> are received within the recess <b>108</b> of the plate <b>40</b>, the cushions <b>42</b> are likewise moved into close proximity to the upper <b>12</b> than would otherwise be permitted if the upper midsole portion <b>44</b> did not include the recess <b>78</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0102" num="0101">Providing the upper midsole portion <b>44</b> with the recess <b>78</b> and providing the plate <b>40</b> with the recess <b>108</b> allows the overall height of the sole structure <b>14</b> and, thus, the article of footwear <b>10</b>, to be reduced. As such, the article of footwear can be optimally designed for weight and performance.</p>
<p id="p-0103" num="0102">During use, when a force is applied to the heel region <b>20</b>, the plate <b>40</b> is permitted to bend and flex due to the generally C-shape of the plate <b>40</b> within the heel region <b>20</b>. As the force transfers from a heel strike and the foot rolls towards the mid-foot region <b>18</b> and the forefoot region <b>16</b>, the force associated with such movement causes the cushions <b>42</b> to absorb the forces and expand outward. The retainers <b>126</b> maintain a desired position of the cushions <b>42</b> relative to the plate <b>40</b> and restrict deformation of the cushions <b>42</b> beyond a predetermined amount. As the force is continued to be applied to the plate <b>40</b>, the plate <b>40</b> continues to flex as the foot rolls from the heel region <b>20</b> to the forefoot region <b>16</b>. The forces applied to the cushions <b>42</b> are transmitted to the plate <b>40</b> but are not felt as point loads by the wearer due to the generally rigid nature of the plate <b>40</b>. Namely, the generally rigid material of the plate <b>40</b> dissipates the forces exerted on the plate <b>40</b> by the cushions <b>42</b> over a substantial length and width of the plate <b>40</b> within the mid-foot region <b>18</b> and the forefoot region <b>16</b>. In so doing, the plate <b>40</b>&#x2014;in cooperation with the upper midsole portion <b>44</b>&#x2014;prevents a point load from being perceived by the wearer during use of the article of footwear <b>10</b>.</p>
