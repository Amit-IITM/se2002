<heading id="h-0011" level="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0018" num="0017">With reference now to the drawings, and in particular to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>1</b> through <b>5</b></figref> thereof, a new whisk device embodying the principles and concepts of an embodiment of the disclosure and generally designated by the reference numeral <b>10</b> will be described.</p>
<p id="p-0019" num="0018">As best illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>1</b> through <b>5</b></figref>, the combination whisk and spatula assembly <b>10</b> generally comprises a handle <b>12</b> that has a flattened base <b>14</b>. The handle <b>12</b> is standable in an upright position having the flattened base <b>14</b> resting on a horizontal support surface <b>16</b>. The handle <b>12</b> has a distal end <b>18</b> with respect to the flattened base <b>14</b> and an outer surface <b>20</b> extending between the flattened base <b>14</b> and the distal end <b>18</b>. Furthermore, the outer surface <b>20</b> is continuously arcuate about an axis extending between the distal end <b>18</b> and the flattened base <b>14</b> such that the handle <b>12</b> has a cylindrical shape, and the handle <b>12</b> is elongated between the distal end <b>18</b> and the flattened base <b>14</b>. The outer surface <b>20</b> tapers inwardly between the flattened base <b>14</b> and the distal end <b>18</b> such that the handle <b>12</b> has a frustoconical shape.</p>
<p id="p-0020" num="0019">A cup <b>22</b> is provided and the cup <b>22</b> is coupled to the handle <b>12</b>. The cup <b>22</b> has a lower end <b>24</b>, an upper end <b>26</b> and an outer wall <b>28</b> extending between the lower end <b>24</b> and the upper end <b>26</b>. Each of the lower end <b>24</b> and the upper end <b>26</b> is open, and the lower end <b>24</b> is coupled to the distal end <b>18</b> of the handle <b>12</b> such that the distal end <b>18</b> of the handle <b>12</b> defines a base <b>30</b> of the cup <b>22</b>. Additionally, the outer wall <b>28</b> flares outwardly between the lower end <b>24</b> and the upper end <b>26</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0021" num="0020">A whisk <b>32</b> is coupled to and extends away from the handle <b>12</b> such that the whisk <b>32</b> can be manipulated for mixing a fluid food material <b>34</b>, including but not being limited to, pancake batter, brownie mix or other type of batter. The cup <b>22</b> extends around the whisk <b>32</b> such that the cup <b>22</b> captures fluid dripping from the whisk <b>32</b> when the handle <b>12</b> is stood upon the flattened base <b>14</b>. The whisk <b>32</b> comprises a plurality of members <b>36</b> that is each coupled to the distal end <b>18</b> of the handle <b>12</b> and forming an arc extending away from the distal end <b>18</b>. The plurality of members <b>36</b> includes a set of first members <b>38</b> and a set of second members <b>40</b>. The set of first members <b>38</b> is arranged to form a bulb. Additionally, each of the second members <b>40</b> has a length that is greater than a length of the first members <b>38</b>, and the set of second members <b>40</b> is arranged to surround the set of first members <b>38</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0022" num="0021">A pair of blades <b>42</b> is provided and each of the blades <b>42</b> is coupled to the whisk <b>32</b>. Each of the blades <b>42</b> has a curved profile thereby facilitating each of the blades <b>42</b> to be scraped against an inside surface <b>43</b> of a mixing bowl <b>44</b> for removing fluid food material <b>34</b> from the inside surface <b>43</b> of the mixing bowl <b>44</b>. Each of the blades <b>42</b> extends laterally away from a respective one of the second members <b>36</b> of the whisk <b>32</b>. The pair of blades <b>42</b> are positioned on opposing legs <b>46</b> of the respective second member <b>40</b> and each of the blades <b>42</b> has a distal edge <b>48</b> with respect to the respective second member <b>40</b>. The distal edge <b>48</b> of each of the blades <b>42</b> curves outwardly from the respective second member <b>40</b> such that the distal edge <b>48</b> of each of the blades <b>42</b> can conform to curvature of the inside surface <b>43</b> of the mixing bowl <b>44</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0023" num="0022">In use, the handle <b>12</b> is gripped to employ the whisk <b>32</b> in the traditional convention of employing a whisk. Additionally, either of the blades <b>42</b> can be scraped against the inside surface <b>43</b> of the mixing bowl <b>44</b> to scrape brownie mix, for example, off of the inside surface <b>43</b> for fully whisking the brownie mix. The handle <b>12</b> can be stood upon the flattened base <b>14</b> for temporary storage and the cup <b>22</b> captures any liquid food material <b>34</b> that drips from the whisk <b>32</b>. In this way the whisk <b>32</b>, blades <b>42</b> and cup <b>22</b> perform the duties of a variety of different kitchen tools for mixing.</p>
<p id="p-0024" num="0023">With respect to the above description then, it is to be realized that the optimum dimensional relationships for the parts of an embodiment enabled by the disclosure, to include variations in size, materials, shape, form, function and manner of operation, assembly and use, are deemed readily apparent and obvious to one skilled in the art, and all equivalent relationships to those illustrated in the drawings and described in the specification are intended to be encompassed by an embodiment of the disclosure.</p>
<p id="p-0025" num="0024">Therefore, the foregoing is considered as illustrative only of the principles of the disclosure. Further, since numerous modifications and changes will readily occur to those skilled in the art, it is not desired to limit the disclosure to the exact construction and operation shown and described, and accordingly, all suitable modifications and equivalents may be resorted to, falling within the scope of the disclosure. In this patent document, the word &#x201c;comprising&#x201d; is used in its non-limiting sense to mean that items following the word are included, but items not specifically mentioned are not excluded. A reference to an element by the indefinite article &#x201c;a&#x201d; does not exclude the possibility that more than one of the element is present, unless the context clearly requires that there be only one of the elements.</p>
