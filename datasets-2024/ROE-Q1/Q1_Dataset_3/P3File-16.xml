<heading id="h-0006" level="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS</heading>
<p id="p-0028" num="0027">The description of illustrative embodiments according to principles of the present invention is intended to be read in connection with the accompanying drawings, which are to be considered part of the entire written description. In the description of embodiments of the invention disclosed herein, any reference to direction or orientation is merely intended for convenience of description and is not intended in any way to limit the scope of the present invention. Relative terms such as &#x201c;lower,&#x201d; &#x201c;upper,&#x201d; &#x201c;horizontal,&#x201d; &#x201c;vertical,&#x201d; &#x201c;above,&#x201d; &#x201c;below,&#x201d; &#x201c;up,&#x201d; &#x201c;down,&#x201d; &#x201c;top&#x201d; and &#x201c;bottom&#x201d; as well as derivative thereof (e.g., &#x201c;horizontally,&#x201d; &#x201c;downwardly,&#x201d; &#x201c;upwardly,&#x201d; etc.) should be construed to refer to the orientation as then described or as shown in the drawing under discussion. These relative terms are for convenience of description only and do not require that the apparatus be constructed or operated in a particular orientation unless explicitly indicated as such. Terms such as &#x201c;attached,&#x201d; &#x201c;affixed,&#x201d; &#x201c;connected,&#x201d; &#x201c;coupled,&#x201d; &#x201c;interconnected,&#x201d; and similar refer to a relationship wherein structures are secured or attached to one another either directly or indirectly through intervening structures, as well as both movable or rigid attachments or relationships, unless expressly described otherwise. Moreover, the features and benefits of the invention are illustrated by reference to the exemplified embodiments. Accordingly, the invention expressly should not be limited to such exemplary embodiments illustrating some possible non-limiting combination of features that may exist alone or in other combinations of features; the scope of the invention being defined by the claims appended hereto.</p>
<p id="p-0029" num="0028">This disclosure describes the best mode or modes of practicing the invention as presently contemplated. This description is not intended to be understood in a limiting sense, but provides an example of the invention presented solely for illustrative purposes by reference to the accompanying drawings to advise one of ordinary skill in the art of the advantages and construction of the invention. In the various views of the drawings, like reference characters designate like or similar parts.</p>
<p id="p-0030" num="0029">An embodiment of the present disclosure may provide a beverage maker to extract the flavor from brewing materials, such as coffee grounds. Although the present disclosure mainly discusses brewing coffee, a system and a method in the present disclosure may be applied not only to brewing coffee but also to brewing beverages other than coffee, such as tea and any other beverage that can be brewed. The term &#x201c;brewing material&#x201d; may include, but is not limited to, coffee grounds, tea leaves, cocoa, fruit, grains, herbs, or any other materials used for brewing. Accordingly, while the beverage maker is described in terms of brewing coffee, it is equally applicable to brewing tea, infusing spirits, and the like.</p>
<p id="p-0031" num="0030">In one example, the present disclosure may provide a beverage maker that may function in first and second modes. In the first mode (e.g., carafe mode) the beverage maker may brew beverages by having water pass through/around a brewing material on a filter. In the second mode (e.g., cartridge mode), the beverage maker may brew beverages through a single-serve beverage cartridge that has a brewing material. The single-serve beverage cartridge may include, for example, K-Cups&#xae; and other single-serve cartridge styles. In one example, a single water source may be used in the first and second modes. This may provide a more convenient beverage maker.</p>
<p id="p-0032" num="0031"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref> shows a perspective view of a beverage maker according to one embodiment. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref> shows a cross sectional view of a beverage maker taken along the 2-2 line in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>3</b>A and <b>3</b>B</figref> show perspective views of the beverage maker of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref> according to one embodiment. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b></figref> shows a cross sectional view of another example of a beverage maker according to one embodiment. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>3</b>A, <b>3</b>B, and <b>4</b></figref> show beverage makers in the first mode <b>801</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0033" num="0032">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>1</b>-<b>3</b>B</figref>, the beverage maker <b>100</b> may include a housing body <b>200</b>, a water tank <b>210</b>, a water path <b>220</b>, a lid <b>230</b>, a water source <b>231</b>, a filter holder <b>300</b>, and a beverage cartridge adapter <b>400</b>. The water tank <b>210</b> may be fluidly communicated with the water path <b>220</b>. The lid <b>230</b> may be attached to the housing body <b>200</b>. The lid <b>230</b> may include a recess <b>239</b> (see <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b>B</figref>). The water source <b>231</b> may be fluidly communicated with the water path <b>220</b>. In one embodiment, the water source <b>231</b> may be positioned at the lid <b>230</b>. In the example of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>2</b> and <b>3</b>B</figref>, the water source <b>231</b> may be positioned in the recess <b>239</b> of the lid <b>230</b>. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref>, the water source <b>231</b> may be a needle, but may be any configuration other than a needle. In one embodiment as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref>, the water source <b>231</b> may extend vertically, but may extend in a direction different from the vertical direction. Typically, such a vertically extending needle may be usable to pierce a lid of a single-serve beverage cartridge during use.
