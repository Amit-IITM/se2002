<p id="p-0002" num="0001">The subject matter relates to the field of loading an atomizable substance, after being atomized, into a human body, and in particular to an atomizer and an inhalation device including the atomizer.</p>
<heading id="h-0002" level="1">BACKGROUND</heading>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">An inhalation device generally includes an atomizer and a power supply assembly. The atomizer can heat a liquid atomizable substance to generate smoke or aerosol by means of atomization, for a user to inhale. The power supply assembly is used to supply power to the atomizer. The atomizer includes a pipe for conveying the smoke, a liquid storage chamber for storing the liquid atomizable substance, and an atomizing core for heating the liquid atomizable substance.</p>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">However, when the inhalation device is being carried, the liquid atomizable substance in the liquid storage chamber may leak and flow into a space between the atomizing core and the pipe due to poor sealing between the pipe and the atomizing core, thereby affecting the taste experienced by the user.</p>

The first oil stopper <b>50</b> is received in the first end <b>11</b> of the liquid storage chamber <b>10</b> and is located between the suction part <b>20</b> and the liquid storage chamber <b>10</b>. The first oil stopper <b>50</b> has a first vent <b>51</b>. The second oil stopper <b>60</b> seals the second end <b>12</b> and the second oil stopper <b>60</b> has a second vent <b>61</b>. The air duct <b>30</b> is accommodated in the liquid storage chamber <b>10</b> and communicates with the first vent <b>51</b> and the second vent <b>61</b> through the air duct <b>30</b>. The atomizing core <b>70</b> is arranged between the air duct <b>30</b> and the second oil stopper <b>60</b>. The liquid storage cotton <b>40</b> is arranged in the liquid storage chamber <b>10</b>, disposed annularly on outer walls of the air duct <b>30</b> and the atomizing core <b>70</b>. The liquid storage cotton <b>40</b> is used to store a liquid atomizable substance, which includes an active ingredient. The first oil stopper <b>50</b> and the second oil stopper <b>60</b> are used to seal the liquid atomizable substance in the liquid storage cotton <b>40</b> in the liquid storage chamber <b>10</b>. The atomizing core <b>70</b> is used to heat and atomize the liquid atomizable substance in the liquid storage cotton <b>40</b> to obtain an aerosol. The air duct <b>30</b> is used to guide the aerosol to the suction part <b>20</b> for a user to inhale.</p>
<p id="p-0019" num="0018">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>3</b> and <b>5</b></figref>, a second connecting pipe <b>52</b> extends from a surface of the first oil stopper <b>50</b> facing the second end <b>12</b>. The second connecting pipe <b>52</b> communicates with the first vent <b>51</b>, and their central axes are collinear. At the connection between the second connecting pipe <b>52</b> and the first oil stopper <b>50</b>, a recess <b>53</b> is formed, which extends around a periphery of the second connecting pipe <b>52</b>. One end of the air duct <b>30</b> abuts against the recess <b>53</b>, and the second connecting pipe <b>52</b> extends into the air duct <b>30</b>. An outer wall of the second connecting pipe <b>52</b> abuts against an inner wall of the air duct <b>30</b>, so that the second connecting pipe <b>52</b> tightly cooperates with the air duct <b>30</b>, preventing the liquid atomizable substance from flowing into the gap between the air duct <b>30</b> and the first oil stopper <b>50</b>, which affects the taste experienced by the user.</p>
<p id="p-0020" num="0019">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>2</b> and <b>3</b></figref>, in some embodiments, the liquid storage cotton <b>40</b> is an integrated structure. The liquid storage cotton <b>40</b> can store a large amount of the liquid atomizable substance, and the liquid atomizable substance is stably absorbed in the liquid storage cotton <b>40</b>, reducing the fluidity of the liquid atomizable substance in the liquid storage chamber <b>10</b>, and thereby reducing the risk of leakage and improving the safety of carrying and the service life of the atomizer <b>100</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0021" num="0020">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>3</b> and <b>5</b></figref>, in some embodiments, the suction part <b>20</b> includes a suction port <b>22</b> and an airflow channel <b>21</b> communicating with the suction port <b>22</b>.

<p id="p-0031" num="0030">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>3</b> and <b>5</b></figref>, in some embodiments, a part of an inner wall of the second vent <b>61</b> extends inward to form a boss <b>64</b>, and the base <b>711</b> abuts against the boss <b>64</b>. A plurality of air passages <b>63</b> are arranged on a surface of the second oil stopper <b>60</b> away from the air duct <b>30</b>, the air passages <b>63</b> communicate with the second vent <b>61</b>. An external air flow enters the second vent <b>61</b> through the air passages <b>63</b> and carries the aerosol generated by the heating element <b>72</b> to flow to the suction port <b>22</b> for the user to inhale.</p>
<p id="p-0032" num="0031">In some embodiments, the surface of the second oil stopper <b>60</b> away from the air duct <b>30</b> defines a plurality of air grooves <b>62</b>. Each of the air grooves <b>62</b> communicates with the air passage <b>63</b> and the second vent <b>61</b>, so that the air flow through the air passage <b>63</b> is directed to the second vent <b>61</b> through the air grooves <b>62</b>. In some embodiments, there are four air passages <b>63</b>, the number of the air grooves <b>62</b> is the same as that of the air passages <b>63</b>, and the shape of the air grooves <b>62</b> is substantially fan-shaped.</p>
<p id="p-0033" num="0032">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>6</b> and <b>7</b></figref>, an inhalation device <b>1000</b> includes a casing <b>400</b>, a power supply assembly <b>200</b>, a second liquid absorbent cotton <b>300</b>, and the atomizer <b>100</b>. The atomizer <b>100</b>, the power supply assembly <b>200</b>, and the second liquid absorbent cotton <b>300</b> are all accommodated in the casing <b>400</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0034" num="0033">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>7</b> and <b>9</b></figref>, the suction part <b>20</b> of the atomizer <b>100</b> extends out of one end of the casing <b>400</b>. An outer wall of the suction part <b>20</b> defines a clamping groove <b>23</b> extending around a periphery of the suction part <b>20</b>, and an upper end of the casing <b>400</b> is fixed in the clamping groove <b>23</b> by an adhesive (not shown).

<p id="p-0036" num="0035">In some embodiments, the inhalation device <b>1000</b> may be an electronic cigarette, that is, the liquid atomizable substance is e-liquid. In other embodiments, the inhalation device <b>1000</b> is not limited to an electronic cigarette, but may also be other devices for atomizing the liquid atomizable substance into aerosol for the user to inhale. For example, the inhalation device <b>1000</b> may be an instrument conveying the aerosol formed by atomizing, such as a medical atomization inhaler for treating upper respiratory tract diseases. In this case, the liquid atomizable substance is a liquid drug for treating upper respiratory tract diseases. A patient can inhale drug mist, formed by atomizing the drug liquid, into the respiratory tract and the alveoli through breathing, thus carrying out local drug treatment of the upper respiratory tract. The inhalation device <b>1000</b> can be used to convey the aerosol formed by atomizing the liquid atomizable substance onto surface of the skin. For example, the aerosol is applied onto the skin for cosmetic purposes by the inhalation device <b>1000</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0037" num="0036">Compared with intravenous injection and oral administration, a manner of atomizing drug liquid into aerosol allows the aerosol to directly act on a required treatment location, achieving better treatment effect. In an intravenous injection, the drug liquid is injected into the vein through a syringe and finally transported to the required treatment location. The drug liquid goes through blood circulation in the intravenous injection process. In the oral administration by swallowing, the drug liquid passes through the digestive system and goes through blood circulation to reach the required treatment location. The two manners of intravenous injection and oral administration cannot make the drug liquid fully act on the required treatment location. In addition, on some occasions, compared with the oral administration, the manner of atomizing drug liquid is more convenient.</p>
