<heading id="h-0002" level="1">TECHNICAL FIELD</heading>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">This application relates to the art of lighting and, more particularly, to a portable light holder and related methods.</p>
<heading id="h-0003" level="1">BACKGROUND</heading>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">In many outdoor activities, it is desirable to wear a light to aid any observers (such as drivers, for example) in identifying the location of the wearer, especially in low-light conditions. The light may take various forms, but one common example is a beacon, which may flash to alert the observers to the wearer's location or relative position.</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">Aside from clothing, participants in outdoor activities also often wear packs for carrying gear, such as a backpack. Typically, backpacks do not include a ready solution for connecting such a beacon in a desirable location to ensure it will be noticed by observers. Clothing also does not provide a ready form of attachment for such a light such that it will remain readily visible to an observer, such as along a wearer's chest, upper back or arms.</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">It is also desirable to provide such a pack with the ability to readily accommodate accessories or gear on external portions thereof in a readily accessible manner. One example is a load rail on the rear of the pack, as described in WO2020154369A1, the disclosure of which is incorporated by reference. While well-suited for reliably connecting accessories, it is not readily adaptable for connecting to a beacon, and likewise, a beacon is not readily adapted for connecting accessories or gear to a pack.</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">Accordingly, a need is identified for a light that addresses the foregoing issues and possibly others that have yet to be discovered.</p>
<heading id="h-0004" level="1">SUMMARY</heading>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">In one aspect, an apparatus for connection to a pack includes: a holder including an internal recess, the holder including at least one connector adapted for connecting an accessory to the pack; an insert for positioning in the internal recess of the holder, the insert including at least one light; and a fastener for fastening the holder to the pack.</p>
<p id="p-0009" num="0008">In a second aspect, an apparatus for connecting an accessory includes: a pack; and a holder including at least one light, the holder being fastened to the pack and adapted for receiving a connector for connecting the accessory to the pack.</p>
<p id="p-0010" num="0009">In a third aspect, an apparatus for connection to a pack includes: a holder including an internal recess; at least one connector adapted for connecting an accessory to the pack via the holder; and an insert for positioning in the internal recess of the holder, the insert including at least one light.</p>

<heading id="h-0006" level="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION</heading>
<p id="p-0029" num="0028">In the following detailed description, reference is made to the accompanying drawings that form a part hereof, and in which is shown by way of illustration, specific embodiments in which the invention may be practiced. These embodiments are described in sufficient detail to enable those skilled in the art to practice the embodiments and like numerals represent like details in the various figures. Also, it is to be understood that other embodiments may be utilized, and that process or other changes may be made without departing from the scope of the disclosure. The following detailed description is not to be taken in a limiting sense, where the scope of the invention may encompass more than the appended claims and their equivalents.</p>
<p id="p-0030" num="0029">Reference is now made to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>1</b>-<b>3</b></figref>, which provides various views of a portable light holder <b>10</b> according to one aspect of the disclosure. The light holder <b>10</b> includes a body <b>11</b> defining an internal recess <b>14</b> for receiving a modular light, such as a beacon, and an opening <b>14</b><i>a </i>at one end of the recess <b>14</b> for the modular light to be inserted into the recess <b>14</b> through, as will be outlined further in the following description. The body <b>11</b> is shown as being oblong with straight generally parallel sides and rounded ends, but may take other shapes or forms without limitation. The body <b>11</b> may be formed of a polymer material, including one having a degree of elasticity and resiliency, such as an elastomer (rubber), and thus may be considered to form a boot. The body <b>11</b> may have a degree of elasticity and resiliency that permits that body <b>11</b> to be deformed to insert and remove an insert that is press fit within the body <b>11</b> to be retained by the body <b>11</b>, as will be described in greater detail below.</p>
<p id="p-0031" num="0030">The body <b>11</b> may include a circumferential wall <b>12</b> having pair of sidewalls <b>12</b><i>a</i>, <b>12</b><i>b </i>that extend in parallel with one another, an endwall <b>12</b><i>c </i>extending between the pair of sidewalls <b>12</b><i>a</i>, <b>12</b><i>b </i>at one end of the sidewalls <b>12</b><i>a</i>, <b>12</b><i>b</i>. A rear wall <b>12</b><i>d </i>extends between the pair of sidewalls <b>12</b><i>a</i>, <b>12</b><i>b </i>at another end of the sidewalls <b>12</b><i>a</i>, <b>12</b><i>b </i>opposite the endwall <b>12</b><i>c</i>. Each of the sidewalls <b>12</b><i>a</i>, <b>12</b><i>b</i>, the endwall <b>12</b><i>c</i>, and the rear wall <b>12</b><i>d </i>circumferentially surround the recess <b>14</b> to permit an insert to be inserted into the recess <b>14</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0032" num="0031">The body <b>11</b> may further include a bottom <b>15</b> coupled to a bottom of the circumferential wall <b>12</b>, and a lip <b>17</b> coupled to a top of the circumferential wall <b>12</b> opposite the bottom <b>15</b> to be positioned on opposite sides of the recess <b>14</b> with the recess <b>14</b> positioned therebetween. The bottom <b>15</b> may define passages P that permit a fastener to pass therethrough and couple the body <b>11</b> to an external surface. While the body <b>11</b> is depicted having a pair of passages P, the bottom <b>15</b> may include any number of passages P for coupling the body <b>11</b> to an external surface. The passages P may include an internal receiver <b>12</b><i>f </i>in the recess <b>14</b> that is sized and shaped for engaging a nut. The lip <b>17</b> may extend from the circumferential wall <b>12</b> partially into the opening <b>14</b><i>a </i>to reduce a size of the opening <b>14</b><i>a. </i></p>
<p id="p-0033" num="0032">The body <b>11</b> may further include one or more connectors for forming a connection. This may be in the form of a rail <b>16</b> provided along and spaced from corresponding sidewalls <b>12</b><i>a</i>, <b>12</b><i>b </i>of the body <b>11</b>, except at the connection points, so as to form a passage G. The rails <b>16</b> may each include a central extension <b>16</b><i>a </i>extending in parallel with the respective sidewalls <b>12</b><i>a</i>, <b>12</b><i>b</i>, and a pair of coupling portions <b>16</b><i>b </i>extending between the central extension <b>16</b><i>a </i>and the sidewalls <b>12</b><i>a</i>, <b>12</b><i>b </i>to couple the rails <b>16</b> to the sidewalls <b>12</b><i>a</i>, <b>12</b><i>b. </i></p>
<p id="p-0034" num="0033">A pull <b>18</b> may also be provided at the endwall <b>12</b><i>c </i>of the body <b>11</b>, where the pull <b>18</b> has an opening <b>18</b><i>a </i>for allowing a lanyard, rope, other elongated member, carabiner, or the like to extend through the pull <b>18</b> and couple the body <b>11</b> to an external object. The endwall <b>12</b><i>c </i>may be partially open, such as via opening <b>12</b><i>e</i>, to the internal recess <b>14</b> that allows for a user to insert a finger or object to contact an insert within the recess <b>14</b> to assist with removing the insert from the recess <b>14</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0035" num="0034">Turning now to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>4</b> and <b>5</b></figref>, it can be appreciated that an insert <b>20</b> may be provided for insertion in the internal recess <b>14</b> of the holder <b>10</b>. The insert <b>20</b> may include, for example, a light source. The insert <b>20</b> may include a body <b>22</b> sized and shaped to fit into the recess <b>14</b> so as to create a friction fit. The body <b>22</b> may include an outer surface <b>24</b>, an outer circumferential surface <b>22</b><i>b </i>that circumferentially surrounds the outer surface <b>24</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0036" num="0035">A bumper <b>22</b><i>a </i>may extend from the circumferential surface <b>22</b><i>b </i>away from the outer surface <b>24</b>, and may be circumferential. The bumper <b>22</b><i>a </i>may be sized relative to the proportions of the opening <b>14</b><i>a </i>of the recess <b>14</b> to allow the insert to be securely retained in place. The bumper <b>22</b><i>a </i>may be sized greater than the opening <b>14</b><i>a </i>through the lip <b>17</b> such that when the insert <b>20</b> is positioned in recess <b>14</b>, the bumper <b>22</b><i>a </i>contacts the lip <b>17</b> for the lip <b>17</b> to retain the insert <b>20</b> within the recess <b>14</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0037" num="0036">The outer surface <b>24</b> of the insert <b>20</b> may include one or more light sources. For instance, a pair of spaced LEDs <b>26</b><i>a</i>, <b>26</b><i>b </i>may be provided. One or both of these LEDs <b>26</b><i>a</i>, <b>26</b><i>b </i>may be programmed to flash in one or more colors and thus form a beacon. However, it is contemplated and possible that the insert <b>20</b> includes any operable number and type of light sources, such as light strips, that may provide continuous light, a flash or strobe, or the like.</p>
<p id="p-0038" num="0037">The insert <b>20</b> may comprise a self-contained unit with a source of power. For example, the source of power may comprise a battery <b>28</b><i>a </i>or a solar cell, for powering the light sources. It may also include an on/off switch <b>28</b><i>b </i>that may additionally be used to alternate between light effects, such as continuous light or strobing.</p>
<p id="p-0039" num="0038">As can be appreciated from <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b></figref>, the insert <b>20</b> may be fully removable from the recess <b>14</b> of the body <b>11</b>. In one embodiment, this may be achieved by pulling on the pull <b>18</b> as indicated by action arrow A on the left side of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b></figref>, which in the case of a resilient body <b>11</b> serves to loosen the insert <b>20</b> from the recess <b>14</b> by altering the size and shape of the open end. The auxiliary opening <b>12</b><i>e </i>in the body <b>11</b> may then be used to push the insert <b>20</b> from the recess <b>14</b>, such as by using a tool, finger, or the like to generate upward force, as indicated by action arrow B. This removability allows for the insert <b>20</b> to be readily inserted and removed from the body <b>11</b>, such as for replacement or serving (e.g., changing the batteries).</p>
<p id="p-0040" num="0039">Additionally, with reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>6</b>-<b>8</b></figref>, it can be understood that the holder <b>10</b> may be adapted to attach to another structure, such as a pack (e.g., a backpack B, such as having a hard or rigid outer shell opposite a side including one or more straps). In the illustrated version, and with reference also to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref>, the passages P of the bottom <b>15</b> receive one or more fasteners, such as a bolt <b>30</b> and nut <b>32</b> for securing the body <b>11</b> to the pack. The fasteners may be connected to the pack via a mounting plate M forming part of the pack, and may pass through a wall thereof (which again may be a &#x201c;hard&#x201d; wall opposite the side including the straps in the case of a backpack). The internal receiver <b>12</b><i>f </i>of the passages P are sized and shaped for engaging the nut <b>32</b>, which may be hexagonal, and thus provide an engagement for allowing tightening of the bolts <b>30</b>, potentially without the need for a tool. Once secured in position, the insert <b>20</b> may be located in the internal recess, and may be held in position mechanically by the holder <b>10</b>, as well as by an optional releasable fastener (e.g., Velcro).</p>
<p id="p-0041" num="0040">As can be appreciated from <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>8</b></figref>, with the holder <b>10</b> secured to the pack, such as backpack B, in this manner, it may be used as a tether point for a connector, such as an elastic (i.e., bungee) cord C in the form of an endless loop. Specifically, the bungee cord C may be passed through the passage G formed by one of the connectors (rails <b>16</b>) of the body <b>11</b>, and may be looped around the body as well. This may be done prior to securing the holder <b>14</b> to the pack and before inserting the insert <b>20</b> therein (but of course the connection could be established by simply tying the cord C to the holder <b>10</b> in any manner).</p>
<p id="p-0042" num="0041">By providing a plurality of holders <b>10</b> on the pack and, in particular, along a rear surface thereof, the cord C may be secured in place in a manner that allows for additional articles (e.g., accessories, such as tools or knives, articles of clothing, or the like) to be secured to the pack. Concurrently, the holders <b>10</b> as a result of the insert <b>20</b> including the one or more lights serves as a beacon, thereby alerting observers to the location of the user of the pack. The dual functionality thus afforded by the arrangement avoids the need for providing separate parts for achieving lighting and holding functionality for the pack, and thus facilitates ease of use and may reduce both cost and complexity.</p>
<p id="p-0043" num="0042">Turning to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>9</b>-<b>10</b></figref>, an alternative embodiment of a portable light holder <b>100</b> is provided. In this embodiment, the light holder <b>100</b> includes a body <b>112</b> having an internal recess <b>114</b> for receiving an insert or modular light <b>120</b>, which may have similar structure to the insert <b>20</b> described above, which will not be described again for brevity. The body <b>112</b> is shown as being oblong with straight generally parallel sides and rounded ends. However, the body <b>112</b> may take other shapes or forms without limitation. The body <b>112</b> may be formed of a polymer material, including one having a degree of elasticity and resiliency, such as an elastomer (rubber), and thus may be considered to form a boot.</p>
<p id="p-0044" num="0043">The body <b>112</b> may include a retainer, such as in the form of a clip <b>116</b> located in the internal recess <b>114</b>. The clip <b>116</b> may include a plurality of deflectable arms <b>116</b><i>a </i>extending from the body <b>112</b> that include tabs <b>116</b><i>b </i>for engaging the insert <b>120</b>. A corresponding receiver <b>118</b> may be provided on the underside of the light <b>120</b> for mating with the clip when pushed into engagement therewith so as to form a secure, but releasable connection. The receiver <b>118</b> may include a cavity <b>118</b><i>a </i>formed in the insert <b>120</b> and arms <b>118</b><i>b </i>that extend into the cavity <b>118</b><i>a </i>for engaging with the tabs <b>116</b><i>b </i>of the clip <b>116</b>. The body <b>112</b> may also include a U-shaped sidewall <b>112</b><i>a </i>at each end, forming an intermediate gap G between the U-shaped sidewalls <b>112</b><i>a </i>for tactile engagement of the light <b>120</b>, which can then be separated from the body <b>112</b> (see <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>9</b></figref>).</p>
<p id="p-0045" num="0044">As can perhaps be best understood from <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>8</b></figref>, the body <b>112</b> may also include a plurality of hooks <b>122</b>, such as part of hook-and-loop fasteners. These hooks <b>122</b> may be integrally formed with the body <b>112</b>, such as along a bottom surface thereof, by molding from a plastic material. The hooks <b>122</b> may cover the entire surface of the body or only part of it.</p>
<p id="p-0046" num="0045">Thus, with reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>12</b></figref>, it can be understood that the light holder <b>100</b> may be releasably attached to a suitable connector, such as a loop patch <b>124</b> on an object to be carried or worn by a user, such as an article of clothing. This patch <b>124</b> is shown along a sleeve of the clothing article, but could be provided anywhere on the clothing, including the front or chest in the case of a shirt, or the back. It could also be provided on headwear, footwear, or any other article of clothing, or perhaps even on a pack.</p>
<p id="p-0047" num="0046">In any case, it can be appreciated that the light holder <b>100</b> including the light <b>120</b> may be releasably attached to the patch <b>124</b> as desired, as well as positioned in different orientations. This portability allows for use in dark or low light conditions, when present, and removal for storage in conditions where use of the light <b>120</b> is not needed.</p>
<p id="p-0048" num="0047">As noted above, the light <b>120</b> may also be provided with a trigger or on-off switch. In the illustrated example, this is in the form of a button <b>130</b> for toggling between the on and off conditions. Suitable indicia may be also be provided for indicating which position of the button <b>130</b> turns the light on or off.</p>
