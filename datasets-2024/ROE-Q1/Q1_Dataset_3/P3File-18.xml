<heading id="h-0007" level="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENT(S)</heading>
<heading id="h-0008" level="1">First Embodiment</heading>
<p id="p-0031" num="0030">As illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>1</b>, <b>2</b>, and <b>3</b></figref>, in an image pickup unit <b>1</b> of the present embodiment, a first optical device <b>10</b>, a second optical device <b>20</b>, a third optical device <b>50</b>, and an image pickup device <b>40</b> which is an imager are stacked in the order described above. The first optical device <b>10</b> and the second optical device <b>20</b> are adhered to each other by an adhesive layer <b>30</b>. The second optical device <b>20</b> and the third optical device <b>50</b> are adhered to each other by an adhesive layer <b>59</b>. The third optical device <b>50</b> and the image pickup device <b>40</b> are adhered to each other by an adhesive layer <b>49</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0032" num="0031">In the following description, the accompanying drawings based on each embodiment are schematic. The relationship between a thickness and a width of each portion, a ratio of the thickness of each portion, and the like are different from the actual configuration. The accompanying drawings also include portions having mutually different dimensional relationships and ratios. In addition, there may be a case that illustration of some of constituent elements and assignment of signs are omitted.</p>
<p id="p-0033" num="0032">The first optical device <b>10</b> has a glass plate <b>11</b> as a base substrate, which is a first transparent substrate. The first transparent substrate includes a first principal surface <b>10</b>SA, which is a light incident surface, and a second principal surface <b>10</b>SB on the opposite side of the first principal surface <b>10</b>SA. The first optical device <b>10</b> is a hybrid lens device in which a lens <b>12</b> made of a resin and a spacer <b>13</b> made of a resin are disposed on the second principal surface <b>10</b>SB. The spacer <b>13</b> having a ring shape is arranged around the lens <b>12</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0034" num="0033">The second optical device <b>20</b> has a glass plate <b>21</b> as a base substrate in which a third principal surface <b>20</b>SA and a fourth principal surface <b>20</b>SB on the opposite side of the third principal surface <b>20</b>SA are included. The second optical device <b>20</b> is a hybrid lens device in which a lens <b>22</b> made of a resin is disposed on the third principal surface <b>20</b>SA. The third optical device <b>50</b> is a cover glass for protecting the image pickup device or an infrared cut filter device made of glass having a function of blocking infrared rays. The image pickup device <b>40</b> includes a light receiving portion <b>41</b> and an external electrode <b>42</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0035" num="0034">A subject image condensed by an optical system including the first optical device <b>10</b>, the second optical device <b>20</b>, and the third optical device <b>50</b> is converted into an electric signal by the light receiving portion <b>41</b> of the image pickup device <b>40</b>, and the electric signal is outputted from the external electrode <b>42</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0036" num="0035">As illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref>, a thickness (a dimension in a direction parallel to an optical axis O) of the spacer <b>13</b> having a circular inner circumference and a circular outer periphery continuously decreases outward. As will be described later, the adhesive layer <b>30</b> is disposed on the spacer <b>13</b> using a transfer method, but no air bubbles remain on an adhesive surface <b>13</b>SA of the spacer <b>13</b>. Since the adhesive strength of the adhesive layer <b>30</b> between the first optical device <b>10</b> and the second optical device <b>20</b> is high, the image pickup unit <b>1</b> has high reliability.</p>
<p id="p-0037" num="0036">The lens <b>12</b>, the spacer <b>13</b>, and the lens <b>22</b> are, for example, an acrylic based resin or an epoxy resin. The glass plates <b>11</b> and <b>21</b>, which are transparent substrates, are made of borosilicate glass, quartz glass, or sapphire glass, for example. The transparent substrate may be a transparent resin plate. The adhesive layers <b>30</b>, <b>59</b> and <b>49</b> are, for example, a transparent resin of an ultraviolet curable type, a thermosetting type, or an ultraviolet heat combined curable type.</p>
<p id="p-0038" num="0037">As will be described later, a configuration of the optical system, that is, the type, the number, and the stacking order of the optical devices can be variously modified in accordance with the specification. For example, a patterned light shielding film having an aperture function may be disposed on the principal surface of the optical device.</p>
<heading id="h-0009" level="2">&#x3c;Manufacturing Method for Image Pickup Unit&#x3e;</heading>
<p id="p-0039" num="0038">A method for manufacturing the image pickup unit <b>1</b> will be described with reference to a flowchart of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b></figref>.</p>
<heading id="h-0010" level="2">&#x3c;Step S<b>10</b>&#x3e; Optics Wafer Fabrication</heading>
<p id="p-0040" num="0039">As illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b>A</figref>, a plurality of lenses <b>12</b> and a plurality of spacers <b>13</b> having a ring shape and surrounding the respective lenses <b>12</b> are arranged on the second principal surface <b>10</b>SB of a glass wafer <b>11</b>W, and a first optics wafer <b>10</b>W is fabricated.</p>
<p id="p-0041" num="0040">On the second principal surface <b>10</b>SB, a plurality of optical functional portions each including the lens <b>12</b> and the spacer <b>13</b> is two dimensionally arranged in a lattice pattern.</p>
<p id="p-0042" num="0041">A thickness of the glass wafer <b>11</b>W is determined in accordance with the specification of the image pickup unit <b>1</b>, but is preferably equal to or more than 50 &#x3bc;m and equal to or less than 1 mm, for example, for miniaturization. Note that when the glass wafer <b>11</b>W is cut, the cut glass wafer <b>11</b>W becomes the glass plate <b>11</b> of the first optical device <b>10</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0043" num="0042">For example, the lens <b>12</b> and the spacer <b>13</b> are fabricated by a mold forming method in which an uncured resin is disposed on the glass wafer <b>11</b>W, and the resin is cured by irradiation with ultraviolet rays in a state where a mold having a concave portion with a predetermined inner surface shape is pressed against the glass wafer <b>11</b>W. Since the inner surface shape of the mold is transferred to the lens <b>12</b> as an outer surface shape thereof, an aspherical lens and the spacer <b>13</b> having a complicated shape can be easily fabricated by the mold forming method. Note that the lens <b>12</b> and the spacer <b>13</b> may be fabricated by an inkjet method, or the like.</p>
<p id="p-0044" num="0043">The spacer <b>13</b> having a ring shape has the thickness (a dimension in a direction parallel to the optical axis O) linearly decreasing outward when the optical axis O of each lens <b>12</b> is the center. In other words, a bottom surface which is the adhesive surface <b>13</b>SA of the spacer <b>13</b> includes a tapered surface inclined from an optical axis side toward the circumference. A thickness of the spacer <b>13</b> may decrease outward in a curved manner</p>
