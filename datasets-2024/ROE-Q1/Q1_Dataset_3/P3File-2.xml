<heading id="h-0002" level="1">TECHNICAL FIELD</heading>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">The present invention generally relates to a device for speeding the flowering cycle of a short-day plant and, more particularly, to using light to convert inactive phytochrome (Pfr) to active (Pr).</p>
<heading id="h-0003" level="1">BACKGROUND</heading>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">When does a plant know when to flower or bloom? Some plants flower or bloom at any time. These are known as day-neutral plants. Some plants flower early in the season, and these are long-day plants, and some flower late in the growing season, and these are short-day plants. Short-day plants flower as the length of daylight shortens and the length of night or darkness increases typically towards the end of the outdoor growing cycle for where the plant is located. Some horticulturally important short-day plants include African Marigolds, Cosmos, Zinnias, Hemp (<i>Cannabis Sativa</i>), and <i>Celosia. </i></p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">Short-day plants have a chemical mechanism to respond to the changing photoperiod. This mechanism is the phytochrome system, in which an inactive form of phytochrome pigment (Pfr) is converted to an active form phytochrome pigment (Pr). In short-day plants, this conversion reaching a threshold level triggers the formation of flowers after exposure to increasing hours of darkness. Typically in Hemp plants, exposure to twelve hours of darkness allows for an adequate conversion of Pfr to Pr to trigger the formation of flowering.</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">In conventional greenhouse agriculture for <i>Cannabis</i>/Hemp, manipulating the phytochrome system to induce flowering is triggered by light deprivation systems that remove the illumination from the <i>cannabis </i>plants by either shutting off the lighting or deploying a black-out screen over the entire grow operation. The <i>cannabis </i>plants respond to the 12 hours of darkness by producing flowers. An approach is needed to increase the inactive Pfr to active Pr and promote flowing in a short-day plant without using known light deprivation approaches while reducing the time required to promote the flowering.</p>
<heading id="h-0004" level="1">SUMMARY</heading>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">Promoting the flowering of short-day plants by exposing the short-day plants to electromagnetic energy in the far-red light wavelengths eliminates the need for light deprivation required in conventional approaches. Pfr is induced to convert to Pr rapidly by briefly exposing the short-day plants to a flash of red light in the wavelengths between 730 and 780 nm. The far-red light exposure is timed to occur at sunset outdoors or prior to the switching off of the light in an indoor growing facility.</p>

It is intended that all such additional systems, methods, features, and advantages be included within this description, be within the scope of the invention, and be protected by the accompanying claims.</p>

<heading id="h-0006" level="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION</heading>
<p id="p-0016" num="0015">A plant lighting device and approach are presented that accelerates the flowering of short-day plants by increasing the conversion rate of inactive phytochrome pigment (Pfr) <b>104</b> to active phytochrome pigment (Pr) <b>102</b> beyond the naturally occurring sunlight and darkness cycle.</p>
<p id="p-0017" num="0016"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref> is a diagram <b>100</b> of the conversion of inactive Pfr <b>104</b> to active Pr <b>102</b> in accordance with an example implementation of the invention. The conversion rate (with sunlight <b>106</b> and in darkness <b>108</b>) of the inactive Pfr <b>104</b> to the active Pr <b>102</b> may be increased by exposure of the plants to far-red light in the wavelengths between 730 and 780 nm <b>110</b>. It so happens that the inactive Pfr <b>104</b> can be induced to convert to the active Pr <b>102</b> more rapidly when the plants are exposed to a flash of far-red light in the wavelength range 730 and 780 nm <b>110</b>. This far-red light exposure timed prior to darkness (at sunset outdoors or just prior to the switching off of the light in an indoor growing environment) accelerates the phytochrome system of short-day plants (i.e., African Marigolds, Cosmos, Zinnias, Hemp, and <i>Celosia</i>). This acceleration is such that the short-day plant responds as if it experienced two additional hours of darkness and consequently flowers more rapidly than it would with only ambient sunlight and darkness cycle.</p>
<p id="p-0018" num="0017">In an outdoor cultivation scenario when the ambient solar day length is 14 hours, brief exposure of the short-day plants to far-red light <b>110</b> at sunset causes the plants to respond as if they experience two additional hours of darkness or the 12 hours of darkness needed to cross the active Pr <b>102</b> conversion threshold and to trigger the formation of flowers in the short-day plants. The exposure to far-red light must continue each evening until the ambient day length reaches 12 hours in length. This approach to growing and flower short-day plants has been successfully used at a latitude of 42.5 degrees north.</p>
<p id="p-0019" num="0018">The impact of this approach enables short-day plants that are adapted to a more southerly climate to flower/ripen to maturity in my northern location. The impact of the approach on indoor cultivation is also profound. Instead of requiring 12 hours of darkness to trigger flowering, with the application of this far-red light at the end of the light cycle a cultivator could induce flowering with 14 hours of lighting. This additional lighting will create an additional 16.5% of light exposure and thus increase flower biomass because of the additional active photosynthetic time, whilst still allowing for the threshold level of the active Pr <b>102</b> to trigger flowering.</p>
<p id="p-0020" num="0019">In nature, flowering in short-day plants begins when darkness reaches 12 hours in duration. Indoor growers mimic this by turning off all lights for 12 hours. Our novel process will increase the yield of short-day plants like <i>Cannabis</i>/Hemp, by triggering the flowering cycle while incident light is between 14 and 15 hours (or as darkness of 9-10 hours.) This process can be utilized both indoors and outdoors. This process utilizes a combination of light waves typically found during the natural triggering process when 12 hours of darkness is present. These light waves include the far-red spectrum and the moonlight spectrum, all simultaneously flashed for a short duration of less than one minute (may optimally be only for a few seconds). The flash can be applied outdoors at sunset or just after dark and indoors just after the lights are turned off or just before turning the lights off. Additionally, this process can be used outdoors to stage harvesting by staggering the exposure to different areas of the cultivation field.</p>
<p id="p-0021" num="0020">Composition of the triggering light in a preferred implementation:

    <ul id="ul0002" list-style="none">
        <li id="ul0002-0001" num="0021">Wavelength: 730 nanometers, proportion of total light: 90%</li>
        <li id="ul0002-0002" num="0022">Wavelength: 750 nanometers, proportion of light: 4%</li>
        <li id="ul0002-0003" num="0023">Wavelength: 775 nanometers, proportion of light: 2%</li>
        <li id="ul0002-0004" num="0024">Wavelength: 820 nanometers, proportion of light: 2%</li>
        <li id="ul0002-0005" num="0025">Wavelength: 950 nanometers, proportion of light: 2%</li>
    </ul>
    </li>
</ul>
</p>
<p id="p-0022" num="0026">This combination of light wavelengths more effectively triggers flower production outdoors and indoors. and allows the cultivator to apply additional light to the short-day plant in excess of the typical 12 hours of light commonly used in indoor cultivation. In short-day plants the flowering process is triggered by a bioactive compound called Phytochrome which is converted between its active and inactive form based on the number of hours of darkness the plant experiences and the entire process can be manipulated by the application of our process/invention which deploys far red wavelength light and the synergistic spectra reflected in full moonlight. Because the biomass of short-day flowers increases in direct proportion to incident light, our process allows for an increase in indoor production by up to 16% in the same physical space as untreated short-day plants. This same process allows the cultivator to trigger flowering earlier than afforded by natural sunlight in excess of 14 hours, and our invention/process allows the outdoor cultivator the option to stage flowering in short-day plants depending on when our invention is applied to particular rows of plants. The far-red light trigger is synergistically aided by the added spectra applied in the percentage they are found in full moonlight. Full moonlight composition with far-red light wavelength of 730 nanometers, the proportion of total light: 90% with the remaining 10% moonlight light is:

<p id="p-0027" num="0035">The application of the triggering light can be deployed in a portable manner through existing drone technology to apply a flash of the light wavelengths specified above for one minute or less. The utility of triggering light can be deployed on short-day plants in the following ways.</p>
<p id="p-0028" num="0036">Indoors, applying triggering light can induce the flowering of short-day plants with a lighting regime longer than the typical 12/12 light cycle. The triggering light is applied after all grow lights are shut off, in a brief flash of less than one minute. This will allow the application of 14-15 hours of grow lights, depending on the strain or cultivar. The increased illumination afforded by applying the triggering light will allow increased biomass production in the flowering stage in direct proportion to the additional 2-3 hours of incident growth lighting. Initial data suggest up to a 16% increase in flower biomass in plants treated with a flash of triggering light shortly after the onset of the dark cycle of an indoor grow room, or when the light depravation system is applied to greenhouse or hoop house.</p>
<p id="p-0029" num="0037">Outdoors, applying triggering light can induce flowering in short-day plants, after June 21 in the northern hemisphere and after December 21 in the southern hemisphere, when the ambient sunlight reaches 15 hours. The timing of this condition varies by latitude but is easily accessible in locational day-length tables. At latitude 42.27N, the date the triggering light becomes effective is July 15. After that date, applying the triggering light to the short-day plants after sunset for a brief flash (less than one minute) every night until August 15 when the ambient day length reaches 13 hours affords an extra month of flowering time. This is particularly significant for short-day plants of a subtropical nature that might not finish in more northerly latitudes. In essence, the triggering light results in flowering that adds up to months of time for flower development in any short-day plant.</p>
<p id="p-0030" num="0038">The triggering light has a significant impact on the staging of the flowering cycle in the outdoor cultivation of short-day plants. For example, if an outdoor cultivator desired to efficiently stage short-day plant harvest over a period of time, rather than harvesting an entire crop all at once, our invention/process could be applied in a sequence to a portion of the outdoor field where a short-day crop is grown. For example, at latitude 42.27N, in one third of the production space (called section A), triggering light is applied after sunset for less than one minute nightly beginning on July 15. This illumination cycle would continue until August 15. On August 1, our flower triggering light would be applied to the next third of the production space (called section B) in the same manner until August 15. The final third, (section C) is not illuminated by triggering light. Assuming the entire field is composed of the same strain or cultivar with a 9-week flowering period until full maturity, Section A will be ready to harvest on September 21, Section B will be ready for harvest on October 3, and Section C will be ready for harvest on October 17. This allows the cultivator to stage their outdoor harvest and more efficiently deploy labor to bring down and process the plants, as opposed to the harvest conditions where our invention/process is not applied where the entire crop reaches maturity at the same time, potentially overwhelming cultivation labor at the end of the growth cycle with detrimental fungal conditions increasing as the weather cools.</p>
<p id="p-0031" num="0039">Conversely, if the staging of harvest labor is not an issue, the cultivator can deploy triggering light for one minute or less on the entire field and harvest the entire crop before the onset of any number of types of negative ambient conditions that can occur later in the growth cycle depending on one's location. One example is the onset of cooler and wetter weather in the late season which has a detrimental fungal impact on short-day flowers.</p>

The switch <b>210</b> energizes the device <b>202</b>. The timer <b>208</b> may be a mechanical timer, electric timer, digital timer, or a combination of electro-mechanical timer. In the current implementation, a digital timer is employed as timer <b>208</b> and starts operating in response to the switch <b>210</b>. In other implementations, the timer <b>208</b> may control a plurality of RLDs. The timer <b>208</b> is set to activate the far-red light bulb <b>204</b> via light controller <b>206</b> at the end of a light cycle (sunset or prior to traditional lights being turned off) for ten minutes in the current implementations, but in other implementations the time may be between five and fifteen minutes. The brief exposure at the end of the light cycle to the light from the far-red light bulb <b>204</b> triggers early flowering and so allows for the successful growth of short-day plants in more northerly areas by boosting biomass and the concurrent trichome production. Similarly, in indoor cultivation operations, the early flowering of short-day plants increases productivity and profit while reducing the expense required in light deprivation technologies.</p>
