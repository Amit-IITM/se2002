<heading id="h-0001" level="1">TECHNICAL FIELD</heading>
<p id="p-0002" num="0001">Example embodiments generally relate to non-combustible aerosol provision systems and, in particular, relate to a device and system for testing and confirming the capability of an aerosol provision device to conduct post sale activation (PSA).</p>
<heading id="h-0002" level="1">BACKGROUND</heading>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">Non-combustible aerosol provision systems (e.g., e-cigarettes/tobacco heating products or other such devices) generally contain an aerosolisable material, such as a reservoir of a source liquid containing a formulation. The formulation typically includes nicotine, or a solid material such as a tobacco-based product, from which an aerosol is generated for inhalation by a user, for example through heat vaporization. However, devices including formulations with other materials, such as cannabinoids (e.g., Tetrahydrocannabinol (THC) and/or Cannabidiol (CBD)), botanicals, medicinals, caffeine, and/or other active ingredients, are also possible. Thus, a non-combustible aerosol provision system will typically include an aerosol generation chamber containing a vaporizer, e.g., a heater, arranged to vaporize a portion of the aerosolisable material to generate an aerosol in the aerosol generation chamber. As a user inhales on a mouthpiece of the device and electrical power is supplied to the heater, air is drawn into the device and into the aerosol generation chamber where the air mixes with the vaporized aerosolisable material and forms a condensation aerosol. There is a flow path between the aerosol generation chamber and an opening in the mouthpiece so the air drawn through the aerosol generation chamber continues along the flow path to an opening in the mouthpiece, carrying some of the condensation aerosol with it, and out through the opening in the mouthpiece for inhalation by the user.</p>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">Aerosol provision systems include, for example, vapor products, such as those delivering nicotine that are commonly known as &#x201c;electronic cigarettes,&#x201d; &#x201c;e-cigarettes&#x201d; or electronic nicotine delivery systems (ENDS), as well as heat-not-burn products including tobacco heating products (THPs). Many of these products take the form of a system including a device and a consumable, and it is the consumable that includes the material from which the substance to be delivered originates. Typically, the device is reusable, and the consumable is single-use (although some consumables are refillable as in the case of so called &#x201c;open&#x201d; systems). Therefore, in many cases, the consumable is sold separately from the device, and often in a multipack. Moreover, subsystems and some individual components of devices or consumables may be sourced from specialist manufacturers.</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">Aerosol provision devices, like those described above, may be subject to certain restrictions, including age restrictions. In some locations, use of the articles including the cartridges of an ENDS device is limited based on user age. To accommodate the need for authentication of a device by an age verified user, any of a number of authentication methods may be employed. However, many of these authentication methods may require interaction with a host device (e.g., a smartphone or other wireless communication device that can access authentication services). These authentication methods may therefore rely on the ability of the user to effectively carry on the interaction between the host device and the aerosol provision device in order to seamlessly complete the authentication process. Accordingly, it may be desirable to introduce methods, devices or systems that ensure the reliability of the aerosol provision devices relative to their proper setup for PSA, and ensure that they also have the proper functional capability to be authenticated by authorized or age verified users.</p>
<heading id="h-0003" level="1">BRIEF SUMMARY OF SOME EXAMPLES</heading>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">In an example embodiment, a test fixture for testing aerosol provision devices with respect to proper unlocking of such devices in connection with a PSA process be provided. The test fixture may include a housing, a plurality of testing modules disposed at the housing where each of the testing modules includes a cavity configured to receive a portion of an aerosol provision device, and processing circuitry operably coupled to the testing modules. Each of the testing modules may be configured to interface with an assembly of a respective one of the aerosol provision devices to transition the assembly between an initial and a transitioned state during a functional test controlled by the processing circuitry. The processing circuitry may be configured to conduct the functional test of at least two of the testing modules simultaneously.</p>

<heading id="h-0005" level="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION</heading>
<p id="p-0018" num="0017">Some example embodiments now will be described more fully hereinafter with reference to the accompanying drawings, in which some, but not all example embodiments are shown. Indeed, the examples described and pictured herein should not be construed as being limiting as to the scope, applicability or configuration of the present disclosure. Rather, these example embodiments are provided so that this disclosure will satisfy applicable legal requirements. Like reference numerals refer to like elements throughout. As used herein, operable coupling should be understood to relate to direct or indirect connection that, in either case, enables functional interconnection of components that are operably coupled to each other.</p>
<p id="p-0019" num="0018">As indicated above, the present disclosure relates to requiring an authentication of an age-restricted device, such as an aerosol delivery device or an electronic nicotine delivery systems (&#x201c;ENDS&#x201d;) device. The authentication may include or require a prior age verification, such that the age-restricted device is not operational for a user that is not age-verified. The authentication may include the age-restricted device receiving a control signal for authenticating the device. The control signal may include audio signals and/or visual/optical signals for authenticating the device. In some case, the authentication may be initiated after a device wakeup procedure, in order to conserve power prior to authentication. However, in any case, the authentication (and/or wakeup) may be initiated by insertion of a dedicated module into the device. The module may therefore be added to minimize changes to existing ENDS device designs.</p>
<p id="p-0020" num="0019">An aerosol delivery device or ENDS is one example of a device that may be associated with restriction, such as an age restriction. Other examples include delivery devices for delivery of cannabinoids, such as Tetrahydrocannabinol (THC) and/or Cannabidiol (CBD), botanicals, medicinals, and/or other active ingredients. Thus, it will be appreciated that while an aerosol delivery or ENDS device is used as an example application of various embodiments throughout, this example is intended to be non-limiting such that inventive concepts disclosed herein can be used with devices other than aerosol delivery or ENDS devices, including aerosol delivery devices that may be used to deliver other medicinal and/or active ingredients to a user or may include smokeless tobacco or other tobacco products.</p>
<p id="p-0021" num="0020">The device authentication by a control signal can be in addition to, or may be required as a prerequisite to, the user performing age verification. A user that has not been age verified cannot authenticate a device. The authentication may need to be performed periodically for usage of an age-restricted product. There may be an age verification system for confirming an age of a user and/or authenticating the proper user and/or device. In any case, these activities may be referred to generally as post sale activation (PSA). The conduct of PSA is generally well received by consumers as long as the procedures for conducting PSA are relatively straightforward to employ. That said, if consumers encounter technical problems with any degree of frequency in the performance of PSA, negative impacts on brand loyalty and overall product usage can be expected. Thus, it may be desirable to confirm, prior to shipping of aerosol delivery devices for distribution, that each such device can be properly locked and unlocked. Example embodiments may provide a test fixture and/or methods for ensuring that aerosol delivery devices are functionally equipped to be locked and unlocked in association with PSA.</p>
<p id="p-0022" num="0021">Given that example embodiments may be employed in connection with providing security for non-combustible aerosol provision systems such as ENDS devices, a general description of an example device will be provided since some aspects of the test fixture may be tailored to interface with the case and/or other structural aspects of the ENDS devices.</p>
<p id="p-0023" num="0022">Unless specified otherwise or clear from context, references to first, second or the like should not be construed to imply a particular order. A feature described as being above another feature (unless specified otherwise or clear from context) may instead be below, and vice versa; and similarly, features described as being to the left of another feature else may instead be to the right, and vice versa. Also, while reference may be made herein to quantitative measures, values, geometric relationships or the like, unless otherwise stated, any one or more if not all of these may be absolute or approximate to account for acceptable variations that may occur, such as those due to engineering tolerances or the like.</p>
<p id="p-0024" num="0023">As used herein, unless specified otherwise or clear from context, the &#x201c;or&#x201d; of a set of operands is the &#x201c;inclusive or&#x201d; and thereby true if and only if one or more of the operands is true, as opposed to the &#x201c;exclusive or&#x201d; which is false when all of the operands are true. Thus, for example, &#x201c;[A] or [B]&#x201d; is true if [A] is true, or if [B] is true, or if both [A] and [B] are true. Further, the articles &#x201c;a&#x201d; and &#x201c;an&#x201d; mean &#x201c;one or more,&#x201d; unless specified otherwise or clear from context to be directed to a singular form. Furthermore, it should be understood that unless otherwise specified, the terms &#x201c;data,&#x201d; &#x201c;content,&#x201d; &#x201c;digital content,&#x201d; &#x201c;information,&#x201d; and similar terms may be at times used interchangeably.</p>
<p id="p-0025" num="0024">Example implementations of the present disclosure are generally directed to test fixtures or methods for interfacing with delivery systems designed to deliver at least one substance to a user, such as to satisfy a particular &#x201c;consumer moment.&#x201d; The substance may include constituents that impart a physiological effect on the user, a sensorial effect on the user, or both.</p>
<p id="p-0026" num="0025">Delivery systems may take many forms. Examples of suitable delivery systems include aerosol provision systems such as powered aerosol provision systems designed to release one or more substances or compounds from an aerosol-generating material without combusting the aerosol-generating material. These aerosol provision systems may at times be referred to as non-combustible aerosol provision systems, aerosol delivery devices or the like, and the aerosol-generating material may be, for example, in the form of a solid, semi-solid, liquid or gel and may or may not contain nicotine.</p>
<p id="p-0027" num="0026">Examples of suitable aerosol provision systems include vapor products, heat-not-burn products, hybrid products and the like. Vapor products are commonly known as &#x201c;electronic cigarettes,&#x201d; &#x201c;e-cigarettes&#x201d; or electronic nicotine delivery systems (ENDS), although the aerosol-generating material need not include nicotine. Many vapor products are designed to heat a liquid material to generate an aerosol. Other vapor products are designed to break up an aerosol-generating material into an aerosol without heating, or with only secondary heating. Heat-not-burn products include tobacco heating products (THPs) and carbon-tipped tobacco heating products (CTHPs), and many are designed to heat a solid material to generate an aerosol without combusting the material.</p>
<p id="p-0028" num="0027">Hybrid products use a combination of aerosol-generating materials, one or a plurality of which may be heated. Each of the aerosol-generating materials may be, for example, in the form of a solid, semi-solid, liquid, or gel. Some hybrid products are similar to vapor products except that the aerosol generated from a liquid or gel aerosol-generating material passes through a second material (such as tobacco) to pick up additional constituents before reaching the user. In some example implementations, the hybrid system includes a liquid or gel aerosol-generating material, and a solid aerosol-generating material. The solid aerosol-generating material may include, for example, tobacco or a non-tobacco product.</p>

<p id="p-0054" num="0053">In some examples, the aerosol generator <b>106</b> may include a susceptor, or the susceptor may be part of the substrate <b>134</b>. The susceptor is a material that is heatable by penetration with a varying magnetic field generated by a magnetic field generator that may be separate from or part of the aerosol generator. The susceptor may be an electrically-conductive material, so that penetration thereof with a varying magnetic field causes induction heating of the heating material. The heating material may be magnetic material, so that penetration thereof with a varying magnetic field causes magnetic hysteresis heating of the heating material. The susceptor in some examples may be both electrically-conductive and magnetic, so that the susceptor of these examples is heatable by both heating mechanisms.</p>
<p id="p-0055" num="0054">Although not separately shown, either or both the aerosol provision device <b>102</b> or the consumable <b>104</b> may include an aerosol-modifying agent.

At least a portion of the aerosol-generating material transfer component may be positioned proximate (e.g., directly adjacent, adjacent, in close proximity to, or in relatively close proximity to) the electric heater. The aerosol-generating material transfer component may extend between the electric heater and the aerosol-generating material stored in the reservoir, and at least a portion of the electric heater may be located above a proximal end the reservoir. For the purposes of the present disclosure, it should be understood that the term &#x201c;above&#x201d; in this particular context should be interpreted as meaning toward a proximal end of the reservoir and/or the consumable <b>142</b> in direction substantially along the longitudinal axis (L). Other arrangements of the aerosol-generating material transfer component are also contemplated within the scope of the disclosure. For example, in some example implementations, the aerosol-generating material transfer component may be positioned proximate a distal end of the reservoir and/or arranged transverse to the longitudinal axis (L).</p>
<p id="p-0064" num="0063">The electric heater <b>144</b> and aerosol-generating material transfer component <b>176</b> may be configured as separate elements that are fluidly connected, the electric heater and aerosol-generating material transfer component or may be configured as a combined element. For example, in some implementations an electric heater may be integrated into an aerosol-generating material transfer component. Moreover, the electric heater and the aerosol-generating material transfer component may be formed of any construction as otherwise described herein. In some examples, a valve may be positioned between the reservoir <b>174</b> and electric heater, and configured to control an amount of aerosol-generating material <b>164</b> passed or delivered from the reservoir to the electric heater.</p>
<p id="p-0065" num="0064">An opening <b>178</b> may be present in the housing <b>172</b> (e.g., at the mouth end of the mouthpiece portion) to allow for egress of formed aerosol from the consumable <b>142</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0066" num="0065">As indicated above, the circuitry <b>152</b> of the aerosol provision device <b>141</b> may include a number of electronic components, and in some examples may be formed of a circuit board such as a PCB that supports and electrically connects the electronic components. The sensor <b>154</b> (switch) may be one of these electronic components positioned on the circuit board. In some examples, the sensor may comprise its own circuit board or other base element to which it can be attached. In some examples, a flexible circuit board may be utilized. A flexible circuit board may be configured into a variety of shapes. In some examples, a flexible circuit board may be combined with, layered onto, or form part or all of a heater substrate.</p>
<p id="p-0067" num="0066">In some examples, the reservoir <b>174</b> may be a container for storing the aerosol-generating material <b>164</b>. In some examples, the reservoir may be or include a fibrous reservoir with a substrate with the aerosol-generating material present on or in a support. For example, the reservoir can comprise one or more layers of nonwoven fibers substantially formed into the shape of a tube encircling the interior of the housing <b>172</b>, in this example. The aerosol-generating material may be retained in the reservoir. Liquid components, for example, may be absorptively retained by the reservoir. The reservoir may be in fluid connection with the aerosol-generating material transfer component <b>176</b>. The aerosol-generating material transfer component may transport the aerosol-generating material stored in the reservoir via capillary action&#x2014;or via a micro pump&#x2014;to the electric heater <b>144</b>. As such, the electric heater is in a heating arrangement with the aerosol-generating material transfer component.</p>
<p id="p-0068" num="0067">In use, when a user draws on the aerosol provision system <b>140</b>, airflow is detected by the sensor <b>154</b>, and the electric heater <b>144</b> is activated to energize the aerosol-generating material <b>164</b> to generate an aerosol. Drawing upon the mouth end of the aerosol provision system causes ambient air to enter and pass through the aerosol provision system. In the consumable <b>142</b>, the drawn air combines with the aerosol that is whisked, aspirated or otherwise drawn away from the electric heater and out the opening <b>178</b> in the mouth end of the aerosol provision system.</p>
<p id="p-0069" num="0068">Again, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>1</b>B and <b>1</b>C</figref>, the aerosol generator of the aerosol provision system <b>140</b> is an electric heater <b>144</b> designed to heat the aerosol-generating material <b>164</b> to generate an aerosol. In other implementations, the aerosol generator is designed to break up the aerosol-generating material without heating, or with only secondary heating. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b>D</figref> illustrates a nebulizer <b>180</b> that may be used to implement the aerosol generator of an aerosol provision system, according to some these other example implementations.</p>
<p id="p-0070" num="0069">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b>D</figref>, the nebulizer <b>180</b> includes a mesh plate <b>182</b> and a piezo material <b>184</b> that may be affixed to one another. The piezo material may be driven to vibrate and cause the mesh plate to break up aerosol-generating material into an aerosol. In some examples, the nebulizer may also include a supporting component located on a side of the mesh plate opposite the piezo material to increase the longevity of the mesh plate, and/or an auxiliary component between the mesh plate and the piezo material to facilitate interfacial contact between the mesh plate and the piezo material.</p>
<p id="p-0071" num="0070">In various example implementations, the mesh plate <b>182</b> may have a variety of different configurations. The mesh plate may have a flat profile, a domed shape (concave or convex with respect to the aerosol-generating material), or a flat portion and a domed portion. The mesh plate defines a plurality of perforations <b>186</b> that may be substantially uniform or vary in size across a perforated portion of the mesh plate. The perforations may be circular openings or non-circular openings (e.g., oval, rectangular, triangular, regular polygon, irregular polygon). In three-dimensions, the perforations may have a fixed cross section such as in the case of cylindrical perforations with a fixed circular cross section, or a variable cross section such as in the case of truncated cone perforations with a variable circular cross section. In other implementations, the perforations may be tetragonal or pyramidal.</p>
<p id="p-0072" num="0071">The piezo material <b>184</b> may be or include a piezoelectric material or a piezomagnetic material. A piezoelectric material may be coupled to circuitry configured to produce an oscillating electric signal to drive the piezoelectric material to vibrate. For a piezomagnetic material, the circuitry may produce a pair of antiphase, oscillating electric signals to drive a pair of magnets to produce antiphase, oscillating magnetic fields that drives the piezomagnetic material to vibrate.</p>
<p id="p-0073" num="0072">The piezo material <b>184</b> may be affixed to the mesh plate <b>182</b>, and vibration of the piezo material may in turn cause the mesh plate to vibrate. The mesh plate may be in contact with or immersed in aerosol-generating material, in sufficient proximity of aerosol-generating material, or may otherwise receive aerosol-generating material via an aerosol-generating material transfer component. The vibration of the mesh plate, then, may cause the aerosol-generating material to pass through the perforations <b>186</b> that break up the aerosol-generating material into an aerosol. More particularly, in some examples, aerosol-generating material may be driven through the perforations <b>186</b> in the vibrating mesh plate <b>182</b> resulting in aerosol particles. In other examples in which the mesh plate is in contact with or immersed in aerosol-generating material, the vibrating mesh plate may create ultrasonic waves within aerosol-generating material that cause formation of an aerosol at the surface of the aerosol-generating material.</p>
<p id="p-0074" num="0073">As described above, hybrid products use a combination of aerosol-generating materials, and some hybrid products are similar to vapor products except that the aerosol generated from one aerosol-generating material may pass through a second aerosol-generating material to pick up additional constituents. Another similar aerosol provision system in the form of a hybrid product may therefore be constructed similar to the vapor product in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>1</b>B and <b>1</b>C</figref> (with an electric heater <b>144</b> or a nebulizer <b>180</b>). The hybrid product may include a second aerosol-generating material through which aerosol from the aerosol-generating material <b>164</b> is passed to pick up additional constituents before passing through the opening <b>178</b> in the mouth end of the aerosol provision system.</p>
<p id="p-0075" num="0074"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>2</b>A, <b>2</b>B and <b>2</b>C</figref> illustrate an aerosol provision system <b>200</b> in the form of a heat-not-burn product, and that in some example implementations may correspond to the aerosol provision system <b>100</b>. As shown, the aerosol provision system may include an aerosol provision device <b>202</b> (also referred to as a control body or power unit) and a consumable <b>204</b> (also referred to as an aerosol source member or cartridge), which may correspond to respectively the aerosol provision device <b>102</b> and the consumable <b>104</b>. The aerosol provision system and in particular the aerosol provision device may also include an aerosol generator corresponding to the aerosol generator <b>106</b>, and in the form of an electric heater <b>206</b>. The aerosol provision device and the consumable can be permanently or detachably aligned in a functioning relationship. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b>A</figref> illustrates the aerosol provision system in a coupled configuration, whereas <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b>B</figref> illustrates the aerosol provision system in a decoupled configuration. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b>C</figref> illustrates a partially cut-away side view of the aerosol provision system in the coupled configuration.</p>
<p id="p-0076" num="0075">As seen in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>2</b>A, <b>2</b>B and <b>2</b>C</figref>, the aerosol provision device <b>202</b> and consumable <b>204</b> each include a number of respective components. The components illustrated in the figures are representative of the components that may be present in an aerosol provision device and consumable and are not intended to limit the scope of components that are encompassed by the present disclosure.</p>
<p id="p-0077" num="0076">The aerosol provision device <b>202</b> may include a housing <b>208</b> (sometimes referred to as an aerosol provision device shell) that may include a power source <b>210</b>. The housing may also include circuitry <b>212</b> with a switch in the form of a sensor <b>214</b>, a user interface including a light source <b>216</b> that may be illuminated with use of the aerosol provision system <b>200</b>, and processing circuitry <b>218</b> (also referred to as a control component). In some examples, at least some of the electronic components of the circuitry may be formed of a circuit board or a flexible circuit board that supports and electrically connects the electronic components.</p>
<p id="p-0078" num="0077">The housing <b>208</b> may also include a receptacle in the form of a consumable receiving chamber <b>220</b> structured to engage and hold the consumable <b>204</b>. The consumable <b>204</b> may include an aerosol-generating material <b>224</b> that may correspond to aerosol-generating material <b>124</b>, and that may include one or more of each of a number of constituents such as an active substance, flavorant, aerosol-former material or other functional material. And the aerosol-generating material may be present on or in a support to form a substrate <b>226</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0079" num="0078">In the coupled configuration of the aerosol provision system <b>200</b>, the consumable <b>204</b> may be held in the receiving chamber <b>220</b> in varying degrees. In some examples, less than half or approximately half of the consumable may be held in the receiving chamber <b>220</b>. In other examples, more than half of the consumable <b>204</b> may be held in the receiving chamber <b>220</b>. In yet other examples, substantially the entire consumable <b>204</b> may be held in the receiving chamber <b>220</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0080" num="0079">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>2</b>B and <b>2</b>C</figref>, in various implementations of the present disclosure, the consumable <b>204</b> may include a heated end <b>228</b> sized and shaped for insertion into the aerosol provision device <b>202</b>, and a mouth end <b>230</b> upon which a user draws to create the aerosol. In various implementations, at least a portion of the heated end may include the aerosol-generating material <b>224</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0081" num="0080">In some example implementations, the mouth end <b>230</b> of the consumable <b>204</b> may include a filter <b>232</b> made of a material such as cellulose acetate or polypropylene. The filter may additionally or alternatively contain strands of tobacco containing material. In some examples, at least a portion of the consumable may be wrapped in an exterior overwrap material, which may be formed of any material useful to provide additional structure, support and/or thermal resistance. In some examples, an excess length of the overwrap at the mouth end of the consumable may function to simply separate the aerosol-generating material <b>224</b> from the mouth of a user or to provide space for positioning of a filter material, or to affect draw on the consumable or to affect flow characteristics of the aerosol leaving the consumable during draw.</p>
<p id="p-0082" num="0081">The electric heater <b>206</b> may perform electric heating of the aerosol-generating material <b>224</b> by resistance (Joule) heating, induction heating, dielectric and microwave heating, radiant heating, arc heating and the like. The electric heater may have a variety of different configurations. In some examples, at least a portion of the electric heater may surround or at least partially surround at least a portion of the consumable <b>204</b> including the aerosol-generating material when inserted in the aerosol provision device <b>202</b>. In other examples, at least a portion of the electric heater may penetrate the consumable when the consumable is inserted into the aerosol provision device. In some examples, the substrate <b>226</b> material may include a susceptor, which may be embedded within the aerosol-generating material, or on one or either side of the aerosol-generating material.</p>
<p id="p-0083" num="0082">Although shown as a part of the aerosol provision device <b>202</b>, the electric heater <b>206</b> may instead be a part of the consumable <b>504</b>. In some examples, the electric heater or a part of the electric heater may be may be combined, packaged or integral with (e.g., embedded within) the aerosol-generating material <b>224</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0084" num="0083">As shown, in some examples, the electric heater <b>206</b> may extend proximate an engagement end of the housing <b>208</b>, and may be configured to substantially surround a portion of the heated end <b>228</b> of the consumable <b>204</b> that includes the aerosol-generating material <b>224</b>. The electric heater <b>206</b> may be or may include an outer cylinder <b>242</b>, and one or more resistive heating elements <b>244</b> such as prongs surrounded by the outer cylinder to create the receiving chamber <b>220</b>, which may extend from a receiving base <b>246</b> of the aerosol provision device to an opening <b>248</b> of the housing <b>208</b> of the aerosol provision device. In some examples, the outer cylinder may be a double-walled vacuum tube constructed of stainless steel so as to maintain heat generated by the resistive heating element(s) within the outer cylinder, and more particularly, maintain heat generated by the resistive heating element(s) within the aerosol-generating material.</p>
<p id="p-0085" num="0084">Like the electric heater <b>206</b>, the resistive heating element(s) <b>244</b> may have a variety of different configurations, and vary in number from one resistive heating element to a plurality of resistive heating elements. As shown, the resistive heating element(s) may extend from a receiving base <b>246</b> of the aerosol provision device <b>202</b>. In some examples, the resistive heating element(s) may be located at or around an approximate radial center of the heated end <b>228</b> of the consumable <b>204</b> when inserted into the aerosol provision device. In some examples, the resistive heating element(s) may penetrate into the heated end of the consumable and in direct contact with the aerosol-generating material. In other examples, the resistive heating element(s) may be located inside (but out of direct contact with) a cavity defined by an inner surface of the heated end of the consumable.</p>
<p id="p-0086" num="0085">In some examples, the resistive heating element(s) <b>244</b> of the electric heater <b>206</b> may be connected in an electrical circuit that includes the power source <b>210</b> such that electric current produced by the power source may pass through the resistive heating element(s). The passage of the electric current through the resistive heating element(s) may in turn cause the resistive heating element(s) to produce heat through resistance (Joule) heating.</p>
<p id="p-0087" num="0086">In other examples, the electric heater <b>206</b> including the outer cylinder <b>242</b> and the resistive heating element(s) <b>244</b> may be configured to perform induction heating in which the outer cylinder may be connected in an electrical circuit that includes the power source <b>210</b>, and the resistive heating element(s) may be connected in another electrical circuit. In this configuration, the outer cylinder and resistive heating element(s) may function as a transformer in which the outer cylinder is an induction transmitter, and the resistive heating element(s) is/are an induction receiver. In some of these examples, the outer cylinder and the resistive heating element(s) may be parts of the aerosol provision device <b>202</b>. In other of these examples, the outer cylinder may be a part of the aerosol provision device, and the resistive heating element(s) may be a part of the consumable <b>204</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0088" num="0087">The outer cylinder <b>242</b> may be provided with an alternating current directly from the power source <b>210</b>, or indirectly from the power source in which an inverter (as part of the circuitry <b>212</b>) is configured to convert direct current from the power source to an alternating current. The alternating current drives the outer cylinder to generate an oscillating magnetic field, which induces eddy currents in the resistive heating element(s) <b>244</b>. The eddy currents in turn cause the resistive heating element(s) to generate heat through resistance (Joule) heating. In these examples, the resistive heating element(s) may be wirelessly heated to form an aerosol from the aerosol-generating material <b>224</b> positioned in proximity to the resistive heating element(s).</p>
<p id="p-0089" num="0088">In various example implementations, the aerosol provision device <b>202</b> may include an air intake <b>250</b> (e.g., one or more openings or apertures) in the housing <b>208</b> (and perhaps also the receiving base <b>246</b>) to enable airflow into the receiving chamber <b>220</b>. When a user draws on the mouth end <b>228</b> of the consumable <b>204</b>, the airflow may be drawn through the air intake into the receiving chamber, pass into the consumable, and be drawn through the aerosol-generating material <b>224</b>. The airflow may be detected by the sensor <b>214</b>, and the electric heater <b>206</b> may be activated to energize the aerosol-generating material to generate an aerosol. The airflow may combine with the aerosol that is whisked, aspirated or otherwise drawn out an opening at the mouth end of the aerosol provision system. In examples including the filter <b>232</b>, the airflow combined with the aerosol may be drawn out an opening of the filter at the mouth end.</p>
<p id="p-0090" num="0089">As noted above, PSA may be desirable after purchase or acquisition of the aerosol provision devices <b>102</b>/<b>202</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>1</b> and <b>2</b></figref>, or other devices like them. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref> illustrates an example system diagram for functional control of a device <b>300</b> (which may be an example of the aerosol provision devices <b>102</b>/<b>202</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>1</b> and <b>2</b></figref>) for PSA in accordance with an example embodiment. In this regard, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref> illustrates how the device <b>300</b> communicates with an age verification system <b>310</b> through a network <b>320</b> and a host device <b>330</b>, in order to verify the user's age, which may also be used to authenticate the device <b>300</b> periodically. The device <b>300</b> may be in a locked state (e.g., in which the device <b>300</b> is unusable or such usage is strictly controlled) until authenticated properly via the PSA process. After authentication, the device <b>300</b> may be unlocked and operate normally. The age verification system <b>310</b> may be operably coupled with the host device <b>330</b> over the network <b>320</b>. Although not shown, the age verification system <b>310</b> may be coupled with the device <b>300</b> over the network <b>320</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0091" num="0090">The device <b>300</b> may be any aerosol delivery device, including for example an electronic nicotine delivery systems (&#x201c;ENDS&#x201d;) device according to various embodiments described above. In one embodiment, the age verification system <b>310</b> may not only verify an age (e.g. for an age restricted product), but may also provide authentication or user identification (e.g. for an actual purchase or to prevent theft). An example of the authentication and age verification by the age verification system <b>310</b> is further described in U.S. patent application Ser. No. 16/415,460, entitled &#x201c;AUTHENTICATION AND AGE VERIFICATION FOR AN AEROSOL DELIVERY DEVICE,&#x201d; which claims priority to U.S. Provisional App. No. 62/282,222 on Apr. 2, 2019, the entire disclosures of each of which are hereby incorporated by reference. The authentication described below may rely on age verification being performed first and then referenced for subsequent authentication using a control signal <b>340</b> sent to the device <b>300</b>. However, there may be other verification mechanisms other than age. For example, in some embodiments, user identification may be performed in lieu of age verification. Thus, for example, the age verification system <b>310</b> is more generally simply an example of an authorization system that is configured to conduct PSA for the device <b>300</b>, and the age verification system <b>310</b> may therefore more generally be referred to as an authentication agent. Cartridges or consumables may be registered as part of the age verification or authentication process as described in U.S. patent application Ser. No. 16/415,444, entitled &#x201c;AGE VERIFICATION WITH REGISTERED CARTRIDGES FOR AN AEROSOL DELIVERY DEVICE,&#x201d; filed on May 17, 2019, the entire disclosure of which is herein incorporated by reference. U.S. Pat. No. 8,689,804 to Fernando et al. discloses identification systems for smoking devices, the disclosure of which is being incorporated herein by reference.</p>
<p id="p-0092" num="0091">The age verification system <b>310</b> may include a database that tracks users along with ages, as well as maintains a record of the devices and components (e.g. cartridges) along with approvals. It may be encrypted and/or use anonymous identifiers (e.g. numbers, letters, or any alphanumeric identifiers) for each user.</p>
<p id="p-0093" num="0092">The initial age verification may occur and be stored in the database, such as may be maintained at the age verification system <b>310</b> and/or otherwise accessible over the network <b>320</b>. In some embodiments, age verification records may be maintained using blockchain technology. Future age verification requests by that user may be confirmed by calling the database. Specifically, once a user is initially age verified as confirmed in the age verification system database, future verifications (i.e. &#x201c;authentications&#x201d;) may be merely calls to this database for unlocking the device <b>300</b>. In other words, a user initially performs an age verification and then subsequent usage may require authentication without the complete initial age verification requirements. The frequency with which the device <b>300</b> must be unlocked or authenticated can vary. Likewise, the timing for when a user needs to re-verify their age (or otherwise re-authenticate themselves) may vary. For example, each time the cartridge is replaced, the user may need to re-verify or re-authenticate. In some embodiments, the re-authentication may be required after a certain number of puffs from the device <b>300</b> or may be based on the passage of time (e.g. once per hour, day, week, month, etc.). The online database may track the requests for authentication and set limits per user. This can prevent the potential fraud of a single user unlocking other under-age user's devices. This also would prevent the re-distribution of unlocked (i.e. verified and authenticated) devices and/or accessories. Reasonable limits for the number of devices, chargers, consumables, and/or authentications can prevent this potential fraud.</p>
<p id="p-0094" num="0093">A user profile may be stored (e.g. on the device <b>300</b> or from an application or app on a host device <b>330</b>) that includes an age verified identity for the user. An app on the host device <b>330</b> may access the user profile over a network, such as the network <b>320</b>. Once a user is initially age verified as confirmed in the age verification system database, the user profile for that user may be generated and saved so that future verifications (i.e. &#x201c;authentications&#x201d;) may be merely calls to this database. In one embodiment, the age verification may be a prerequisite for the host device <b>330</b> to be able to generate and submit the control signal <b>340</b> to the device <b>300</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0095" num="0094">The host device <b>330</b> may be any computing or communication device, such as a smartphone, tablet, cellular phone, analog phone, computer, or dedicated authentication device at a point of sale. The host device <b>330</b> may communicate with or provide the control signal <b>340</b> to the device <b>300</b> for authentication or activation. The control signal <b>340</b> from the host device <b>320</b> to the device <b>300</b> may be a wired or a wireless signal such as, for example an RF signal, a vibratory signal, an audio signal or a light/optical signal. Optical signals should be understood to include those in the visible light spectrum, but also infra-red signals, fiber optic signals, ultraviolet light signals as well as signals associated with intensity tuning or wavelength tuning. Audible signals should be understood to include those in and outside the audible range for humans. Moreover, audible signals that employ decibel tuning or frequency tuning may also be included. In some embodiments, the host device <b>330</b> may therefore couple audibly or optically with the device <b>300</b> in order to communicate the control signal <b>340</b> to authenticate and/or unlock the device <b>300</b>. Thus, the ability of the host device <b>330</b> with respect to transmission of the control signal <b>340</b>, and the environmental factors that may impact receipt of the control signal <b>340</b> at the device <b>300</b> are all important to successful authentication or authorization of the device <b>300</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0096" num="0095">Particularly for examples in which the control signal <b>340</b> is an optical signal or audio signal, the device <b>300</b> may include an aperture <b>345</b> formed in a housing of the device <b>300</b>. The aperture <b>345</b> may in turn provide access for the audio or optical signal that is an example of the control signal <b>340</b> to reach a signal detector <b>350</b>. The signal detector <b>350</b> may interface with a lock assembly <b>360</b> to alternately lock or unlock the device <b>300</b> as described herein. In some cases, the signal detector <b>350</b> may further include a feedback device (FBD) <b>352</b> that is configured to provide visual, haptic and/or audible feedback to the user relating to the success or failure of attempts to unlock the device <b>300</b> (or other status information). In some cases, the feedback device <b>352</b> may include, vibrating components, lights (e.g., one or more light emitting diodes (LEDs)) or speakers that provide an output responsive to successful or failed efforts to operate the lock assembly <b>360</b>. In an example embodiment, a different color or sequence of lights, or a different sound or tonal pattern may indicate success and failure or even other status information.</p>
<p id="p-0097" num="0096">In an example embodiment, the signal detector <b>350</b> may be configured to process the control signal <b>340</b> to utilize or extract an unlock code therein for PSA. Thus, in a context in which the control signal <b>340</b> is an optical signal, audio signal, an RF signal or a vibratory signal, it should be appreciated that the signal detector <b>350</b> is configured to process the control signal <b>340</b> to determine the unlock code for provision to the lock assembly <b>360</b> to unlock the lock assembly <b>360</b> using the unlock code.</p>
<p id="p-0098" num="0097">The lock assembly <b>360</b> may be configured to prevent operation of the device <b>300</b> for generating an aerosol when the device <b>300</b> is in a locked state, and enable operation of the device <b>300</b> for generating the aerosol when the device <b>300</b> is in an unlocked state. For example, when in the locked state, the lock assembly configured to prevent operation of the aerosol generator <b>106</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref> with respect to generating the aerosol, and enable operation of the aerosol generator <b>106</b> for generating the aerosol in the unlocked state. The lock assembly <b>360</b> may be the last step in the PSA process (or one of the last steps), and may apply the unlock code (or unique code) provided in the control signal <b>340</b> to transition from the locked state to the unlocked state if the unlock code is authenticated. As such, the signal detector <b>350</b> may receive the control signal <b>340</b> and process the control signal <b>340</b> using appropriate techniques to obtain the unlock code from the control signal <b>340</b> and provide the unlock code to the lock assembly <b>360</b>. If authenticated, the lock assembly <b>360</b> may enable the device <b>300</b> to be shifted to the unlocked state to enable aerosol generation, thereby successfully completing the PSA process.</p>
<p id="p-0099" num="0098">As noted above, the control signal <b>340</b> may be a wireless signal that may be, for example, optical or audible. General information regarding processing the control signal <b>340</b> as an optical signal is provided in U.S. patent application Ser. No. 16/441,937, entitled &#x201c;FUNCTIONAL CONTROL AND AGE VERIFICATION OF ELECTRONIC DEVICES THROUGH VISUAL COMMUNICATION,&#x201d; filed on Jun. 14, 2019, the entire disclosure of which is herein incorporated by reference. Similarly, information regarding processing the control signal <b>340</b> as an audible signal is provided in U.S. patent application Ser.

The signal detector <b>350</b> may be configured to provide processing for the control signal <b>340</b> in either context.</p>
<p id="p-0100" num="0099">To the extent a user obtains the device <b>300</b> and attempts to perform PSA in the manner generally described above, but the attempted PSA fails due to limitations of the host device <b>330</b> or various technical or environmental factors, the user may become irritated or annoyed. Meanwhile, if the PSA attempt proceeds smoothly for the user, the likelihood of user satisfaction, positive reviews, and continued sales of such devices may be increased. Thus, to provide a higher likelihood of a positive user experience associated with PSA, example embodiments may provide the ability to ensure that the device <b>300</b> is fully equipped to operate as intended to perform PSA by ensuring that each of the signal detector <b>350</b> and the lock assembly <b>360</b> are functionally tested to operate properly as described in greater detail below.</p>
<p id="p-0101" num="0100">In an example embodiment, a testing fixture <b>370</b> may be operably coupled to the device <b>300</b> to test the device <b>300</b> functionally before the device <b>300</b> is sold or distributed in order to provide this ability. In this regard, for example, the testing fixture <b>370</b> may be configured to interface with the signal detector <b>350</b> to provide test signaling <b>372</b>. The test signaling <b>372</b> may pass through the aperture <b>345</b> formed in a housing of the device <b>300</b>, and otherwise cause the signal detector <b>350</b> to operate as described above to operate the lock assembly <b>360</b> to transition to the unlocked state, and then transition back into the locked state. As such, the testing fixture <b>370</b> may be configured to cycle the device <b>300</b> through the unlocked and locked states to confirm that the device <b>300</b> operates properly for PSA. The testing fixture <b>370</b> may also confirm other information about the device <b>300</b> (e.g., a unique identifier or unique ID of the device <b>300</b>) in preparation for enabling the device <b>300</b> to be sold or otherwise distributed and then unlocked by the user who purchases the device <b>300</b>. Operation of the testing fixture <b>370</b> and various structures, devices or components that may be employed in the testing fixture <b>370</b> will now be described in reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>4</b>-<b>7</b></figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0102" num="0101"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b></figref> illustrates a schematic diagram of one example implementation of the testing fixture <b>370</b>. In this regard, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b></figref> illustrates externally visible features or structures of the testing fixture <b>370</b>, and other figures will show internal features or components. In this example, the testing fixture <b>370</b> may have a housing <b>400</b> that houses or otherwise includes a plurality of testing modules <b>410</b>. The housing <b>400</b> may be a rigid structure supporting each of the testing modules <b>410</b> and, in some cases, the testing modules <b>410</b> themselves may be removable and/or replaceable to either repair or replace a damaged module, or replace modules configured to interface with one type of the device <b>300</b> with modules that are configured to interface with other and different types of the device <b>300</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0103" num="0102">Each of the testing modules <b>410</b> (e.g., testing modules #1, #2, #3, #4, . . . #N) may have a same or similar structure to other testing modules <b>410</b> used at any given time. Moreover, the testing modules <b>410</b> may be operated (or at least operable) simultaneously to conduct testing of multiple respective instances of the device <b>300</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref>. Thus, for example, an operator of the testing fixture <b>370</b> may insert an instance of the device <b>300</b> into each one of the testing modules <b>410</b>. The testing modules <b>410</b> may then execute a testing procedure to test each instance of the device <b>300</b> for proper unlocking and locking operation. In some cases, the testing modules <b>410</b> may also be used to extract or confirm other information from each instance of the device <b>300</b> as well. For example, in some embodiments, the testing modules <b>410</b> may read the unique ID of each instance of the device <b>300</b>. Moreover, in some examples, the unlocking operation may be conducted using an unlock code that is generated based on (and in some cases specific to) the unique ID. Thus, for example, the test modules <b>410</b> may learn or extract the unique ID for the device <b>300</b> in a given one of the testing modules <b>410</b> (i.e., in its cavity <b>412</b>) and reference a listing of corresponding unique unlock codes in a table (stored in memory <b>504</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b></figref>). The unique unlock code for the corresponding unique ID used to enter the table may then be used to generate the unlock instruction for the device <b>300</b>. As an alternative, the unique ID could form a basis for generating the unique unlock code. In either example case, the memory <b>504</b> may store instructions for generation of the unique unlock code based on the unique ID provided.</p>
<p id="p-0104" num="0103">In an example embodiment, each of the testing modules <b>410</b> may include the additional components or structures shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b></figref> in association with testing module #1. In this regard, each of the testing modules <b>410</b> may include a cavity <b>412</b> into which a portion of the device <b>300</b> (e.g., the housing <b>208</b> of the aerosol provision device <b>202</b> or the housing <b>145</b> of the aerosol provision device <b>141</b> described above) may be inserted. In other words, the non-consumable or power unit portion of the device <b>300</b> may be inserted into the cavity <b>412</b>. As such, the cavity <b>412</b> may be defined as an elongated slot that is shaped and formed to receive the power unit of the device <b>300</b>. Thus, the cavity <b>412</b> may have a cylindrical shape, a rectangular prism shape, or various perturbations of these or other shapes in order to receive and support the power unit of the device <b>300</b> that the testing fixture <b>370</b> is designed to test. In many cases, the cavity <b>412</b> may be provided at the front side or front panel of the housing <b>400</b>. In such cases, the cavity <b>412</b> will typically extend into the housing <b>400</b> in a direction parallel to the surface on which the housing <b>400</b> is supported. However, the cavities <b>412</b> may alternatively be on a sidewall of the housing <b>400</b> or another accessible surface or wall of the housing <b>400</b> such as the top surface. When provided at the top surface of the housing <b>400</b>, the cavity <b>412</b> may extend in a downward direction normal or perpendicular to the surface on which the housing <b>400</b> is supported. Thus, one of skill in the art will easily appreciate that in one instance <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b></figref> illustrates a front face (or side face) of the housing <b>400</b> so that the surface is at the bottom of the housing <b>400</b> as the housing <b>400</b> appears on the page. Meanwhile, in another alternative, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b></figref> could be appreciated to show a top face of the housing <b>400</b> such that the surface is behind the housing <b>400</b> as the housing <b>400</b> appears on the page.</p>
<p id="p-0105" num="0104">Each of the testing modules <b>410</b> may also include a status panel <b>414</b> to show a status of testing conducted on the power unit of the device <b>300</b> in the corresponding one of the testing modules <b>410</b> and a start button <b>416</b> (or a key, switch, lever, or other operable member) used as a user interface element for starting (or pausing) a test for the device in the corresponding one of the testing modules <b>410</b>. The operator may therefore insert the power unit of the device <b>300</b> into a selected one of the testing modules <b>410</b> (e.g., testing module #1) and press the start button <b>416</b> of the selected one of the testing modules <b>410</b> to begin a test on the power unit of the device <b>300</b>. While that test begins or is in progress, the operator may insert the power unit of another instance of the device <b>300</b> into an adjacent (or any other) one of the testing modules <b>410</b> (e.g., testing module #2) and press the start button <b>416</b> of the adjacent (or other) one of the testing modules to begin a test on the power unit of the other instance of the device <b>300</b>. This process may be repeated for each of the testing modules <b>410</b> until, for example, all testing modules <b>410</b> have an instance of the device <b>300</b> therein and are conducting or have completed conducting a test on the instance of the device <b>300</b>. The operator can continue to cycle through inserting, testing, withdrawing and inserting new devices in each of the cavities until a full batch of devices has been tested.</p>
<p id="p-0106" num="0105">Each of the testing modules <b>410</b> may also include a data input/output (TO) port <b>418</b>. In some cases, the data input/output port <b>418</b> may be a universal serial bus (USB) port or other standard interface port. However, proprietary connections may alternatively be employed in some examples. Notably, although <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b></figref> shows five testing modules <b>410</b>, example embodiments are scalable to include any desirable number of the testing modules <b>410</b>. In this regard, for example, the average time it takes to conduct a test may be balanced against the number of cavities so that a relatively continuous process of cycling through insertion of devices, initiation of testing, and replacement of the inserted devices with devices needing to be tested after testing of already inserted devices is complete may efficiently be performed.</p>
<p id="p-0107" num="0106">Each of the data input/output ports <b>418</b> of the testing modules <b>410</b> may be operably coupled to a common point or device such as a communications hub <b>420</b>. The communications hub <b>420</b> of this example may be a USB bank configured to connect each of the testing modules <b>410</b> to an operator console <b>430</b> for output of information associated with the testing processes being conducted at each respective one of the testing modules <b>410</b>. Thus, for example, if five testing modules are included (i.e., N=5) as shown in the example of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b></figref>, the communications hub <b>420</b> may receive information from each of the testing modules <b>410</b> for provision to the operator console <b>430</b> via one data line (e.g., a single cable or connection), which may be wired or wireless.</p>
<p id="p-0108" num="0107">The operator console <b>430</b> may include a display <b>440</b> and any of a number of user interface components (e.g., a keyboard, mouse, touch screen interface, etc.). The operator console <b>430</b> may therefore, in some cases, be a standalone computer or laptop. However, in other cases, the operator console <b>430</b> may be collection of individual user interface components such as the display <b>440</b> and a mouse, keyboard, etc. As such, it should be appreciated that the housing <b>400</b> may be connected to different operator consoles, or different components that may act as the operator console <b>430</b>, and example embodiments and testing methods may still be practiced. In other words, the testing fixture <b>370</b> of example embodiments may be interchangeably connected to a number of different output devices or operator consoles. Thus, for example, an operator may obtain one or more instances of the testing fixture <b>370</b> and operably couple the instances of the testing fixture <b>370</b> with any suitable components or devices that can act as the operator console <b>430</b> and no special equipment may be needed to act as the operator console <b>430</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0109" num="0108">However, in other instances, the testing fixture <b>370</b> may be configured to stand entirely alone, and operate testing described herein without any external connections. In such examples, either the communications hub <b>420</b> and the operator console <b>430</b> may be internalized or parts of the testing fixture <b>370</b>, or the testing fixture <b>370</b> may independently operate using just the start button <b>416</b> to start testing and the status panel <b>414</b> to indicate whether the test has passed or failed (or is in progress). For example, the status panel <b>414</b> may include a green light indicating a pass and a red light indicating a fail. Other lights, or simply patterns of flashing for the lights, may be used to indicate other statuses (e.g., testing in progress, time remaining for a test, test phase in progress, etc.).</p>
<p id="p-0110" num="0109">In such an example, the data associated with testing for each power unit of the device <b>300</b> may be recorded in association with the unique ID of the corresponding device. Thus, for example, the start button <b>416</b> may be part of a keyboard or data entry panel via which the unique ID of each instance of the device <b>300</b> may be entered. Alternatively, the testing modules <b>410</b> may be configured to automatically read and determine the unique ID directly from the device <b>300</b>. In either case, testing data may be recorded in association with each unique ID and stored locally at the testing fixture <b>370</b>. The data input/output port <b>418</b> may then be used at a later time to transfer data associated with each of the unique IDs tested to an external device (e.g., the operator console <b>430</b>). The data may then be displayed at the external device or otherwise be analyzed to determine patterns or clues that may be used to improve the testing process, or the locking/unlocking operations that are generally conducted for the device <b>300</b> as described above. Alternatively, the data may be displayed on the display <b>440</b> either in real time or post hoc for analysis or use by the operator.</p>
<p id="p-0111" num="0110">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b></figref>, the display <b>440</b> may provide device information <b>450</b> for each respective instance of the device <b>300</b> in respective cavities <b>412</b> of the testing modules <b>410</b>. The device information <b>450</b> may include a cavity identifier <b>452</b>, a device identifier <b>454</b> that provides the unique ID for the respective instance of the device <b>300</b>, and status information <b>456</b> associated with the testing. Although not required, in some cases, the device information <b>450</b> may also include a soft key such as a start button <b>458</b>, which may be used to control initiation, pausing, or other control over the conduct of testing at the operator console <b>430</b> instead of locally at the housing <b>400</b> (and at each individual one of the testing modules <b>410</b> using the start button <b>416</b>).</p>
<p id="p-0112" num="0111"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b></figref> illustrates a functional block diagram of various components of the test fixture <b>370</b> of an example embodiment. The test fixture <b>370</b> may include processing circuitry <b>500</b> configured to perform data processing, control function execution and/or other processing and management services according to an example embodiment. In some embodiments, the processing circuitry <b>500</b> may be embodied as a chip or chip set. In other words, the processing circuitry <b>500</b> may comprise one or more physical packages (e.g., chips) including materials, components and/or wires on a structural assembly (e.g., a baseboard). The structural assembly may provide physical strength, conservation of size, and/or limitation of electrical interaction for component circuitry included thereon. The processing circuitry <b>500</b> may therefore, in some cases, be configured to implement an embodiment of the present invention on a single chip or as a single &#x201c;system on a chip.&#x201d; As such, in some cases, a chip or chipset may constitute means for performing one or more operations for providing the functionalities described herein.</p>
<p id="p-0113" num="0112">In an example embodiment, the processing circuitry <b>500</b> may include one or more instances of a processor <b>502</b> and memory <b>504</b> that may be in communication with or otherwise control a device interface <b>510</b>. As such, the processing circuitry <b>500</b> may be embodied as a circuit chip (e.g., an integrated circuit chip) configured (e.g., with hardware, software or a combination of hardware and software) to perform operations described herein. However, in some embodiments, the processing circuitry <b>500</b> may be embodied as a portion of an on-board computer.</p>
<p id="p-0114" num="0113">The device interface <b>510</b> may include one or more interface mechanisms for enabling communication with other devices (e.g., modules, entities, and/or other components of the test fixture <b>370</b>, of the control console <b>430</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b></figref>, or the like). In some cases, the device interface <b>510</b> may be any means such as a device or circuitry embodied in either hardware, or a combination of hardware and software that is configured to receive and/or transmit data from/to modules, entities, and/or other components that are in communication with the processing circuitry <b>500</b> (directly or indirectly).</p>
<p id="p-0115" num="0114">The device interface <b>510</b> may, in some cases, connect the processing circuitry <b>500</b> to internal and/or external components that combine to form a user interface for the test fixture <b>370</b>. In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b></figref>, those user interface components are shown to include a monitor/display <b>520</b> (which may be the display <b>440</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b></figref>, or one or all of the status panels <b>414</b> associated with each of the testing modules <b>410</b>), a keyboard <b>522</b>, and a mouse <b>524</b>. The mouse <b>524</b> and keyboard <b>522</b> may be parts of the operator console <b>430</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b></figref> or separate components. If separate, the mouse <b>524</b> and keyboard <b>522</b> may be operably coupled to the processing circuitry <b>500</b> via standard connections (e.g., USB) or via proprietary means. Similarly, the monitor/display <b>520</b> may have any of a number of connection means including, for example, HDMI. Moreover, the device interface <b>510</b> may also or alternatively be operably coupled to other components that provide an audible, visual, mechanical or other output to the user such as, for example, speakers, switches, indicator lights, buttons or keys (e.g., function buttons), and/or other input/output mechanisms.</p>
<p id="p-0116" num="0115">In some embodiments, the device interface <b>510</b> may also operably couple the test fixture <b>370</b> to a power supply <b>526</b>. Thus, for example, the device interface <b>510</b> may include power control circuitry for converting AC to DC power (or vice versa) to power the electrical components of the test fixture <b>370</b>. Thus, the power supply <b>526</b> could be mains power or battery power, regardless of the individual power needs of the components of the test fixture <b>370</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0117" num="0116">In some embodiments, the device interface <b>510</b> may also operably coupled the test fixture <b>370</b> to external components for analysis, remote monitoring, or other purposes via a network <b>528</b> that may be operably coupled to the processing circuitry <b>500</b> via Ethernet or other networking technologies. The network <b>528</b> may be a local, private, public, or other communication network including, for example, a local area network (LAN) or the Internet. In some cases, the test fixture <b>370</b> may include an input/output (I/O) expansion port <b>530</b>. The input/output expansion port <b>530</b> may enable any of a number of additional devices, components, or modules to be operably coupled to the test fixture <b>370</b>. Thus, for example, the input/output port <b>530</b> could be used to connect the test fixture <b>370</b> directly to external devices (i.e., without a network connection) or may be used to expand the capacity of the test fixture <b>370</b> by enabling scaling of the number of testing modules <b>410</b> to which the test fixture <b>370</b> can be coupled. In some cases, the input/output expansion port <b>530</b> may be operably coupled to a printer <b>529</b>, which may be used to print the unique ID of each individual one of the devices. However, the printer <b>529</b> could alternatively be located in or accessed via the network <b>528</b>. As noted above, the unique ID may be used to generate the proper unique unlock code for each respective different instance of the device <b>300</b>. Thus, the consumer or end user will need the unique ID in order to generate (e.g., via the host device <b>330</b>) the correct unique unlock code to operate the lock assembly <b>360</b>. By providing a printed label or other printed version of the unique ID, the information can be provided to the consumer or end user with the product after confirmation (by the test fixture <b>370</b>) that the unique unlock code corresponding to the unique ID does indeed work to unlock the lock assembly <b>360</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0118" num="0117">The processor <b>502</b> may be embodied in a number of different ways. For example, the processor <b>502</b> may be embodied as various processing means such as one or more of a microprocessor or other processing element, a coprocessor, a controller or various other computing or processing devices including integrated circuits such as, for example, an ASIC (application specific integrated circuit), an FPGA (field programmable gate array), or the like. In an example embodiment, the processor <b>502</b> may be configured to execute instructions stored in the memory <b>504</b> or otherwise accessible to the processor <b>502</b>. As such, whether configured by hardware or by a combination of hardware and software, the processor <b>502</b> may represent an entity (e.g., physically embodied in circuitry&#x2014;in the form of processing circuitry <b>500</b>) capable of performing operations according to example embodiments while configured accordingly. Thus, for example, when the processor <b>502</b> is embodied as an ASIC, FPGA or the like, the processor <b>502</b> may be specifically configured hardware for conducting the operations described herein. Alternatively, as another example, when the processor <b>502</b> is embodied as an executor of software instructions, the instructions may specifically configure the processor <b>502</b> to perform the operations described herein associated with testing functional PSA capabilities.</p>
<p id="p-0119" num="0118">In an example embodiment, the processor <b>502</b> (or the processing circuitry <b>500</b>) may be operably coupled to and control the operation of a PSA board <b>540</b> associated with each one of the test modules <b>410</b>. In this regard, based on inputs received by the processing circuitry <b>500</b> responsive to insertion of a power unit into one of the cavities <b>412</b>, the processing circuitry <b>500</b> may initiate the performance of testing via the PSA board <b>540</b> associated with the cavity <b>412</b>. As such, in some embodiments, the processor <b>502</b> (or the processing circuitry <b>500</b>) may be said to cause each of the operations described in connection with the PSA boards <b>540</b> in relation to generating/receiving and processing information associated with locking/unlocking the lock assembly <b>360</b> as described herein responsive to execution of instructions or algorithms configuring the processor <b>502</b> (or processing circuitry <b>500</b>) accordingly.</p>
<p id="p-0120" num="0119">In an exemplary embodiment, the memory <b>504</b> may include one or more non-transitory memory devices such as, for example, volatile and/or non-volatile memory that may be either fixed or removable. The memory <b>504</b> may be configured to store information, data, applications, instructions or the like for enabling the processing circuitry <b>500</b> to carry out various functions in accordance with exemplary embodiments of the present invention. For example, the memory <b>504</b> could be configured to buffer input data for processing by the processor <b>502</b>. Additionally or alternatively, the memory <b>504</b> could be configured to store instructions for execution by the processor <b>502</b>. As yet another alternative, the memory <b>504</b> may include one or more databases that may store a variety of data sets responsive to operation of the PSA boards <b>540</b>. Among the contents of the memory <b>504</b>, applications and/or instructions may be stored for execution by the processor <b>502</b> in order to carry out the functionality associated with each respective application/instruction. In some cases, the applications may include instructions for providing inputs to control operation of the PSA boards <b>540</b> as described herein.</p>
<p id="p-0121" num="0120">In an example embodiment, the memory <b>504</b> may store data associated with signaling used for locking/unlocking the lock assembly <b>360</b> for analysis or debugging. Thus, for example, the memory <b>504</b> may store signaling parameters or characteristics that may be used to analyze why a particular test associated with a particular one of the devices <b>300</b> failed by comparing such parameters or characteristics to those associated with other devices that passed. The memory <b>504</b> may further store instructions for defining how to store testing information, how to aggregate or process such information, and/or how to represent such information on the monitor/display <b>520</b> or other output devices.</p>
<p id="p-0122" num="0121">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b></figref>, the number of PSA boards <b>540</b> may match the number of testing modules <b>410</b> since each testing module <b>410</b> may include a corresponding PSA board <b>540</b>. Each of the PSA boards <b>540</b> of an example embodiment may include an optical sensor <b>542</b> and an optical transmitter <b>544</b>. However, it should be appreciated that to the extent audible signals are used, audio transmitters and receivers could replace the optical transmitter <b>544</b> and optical sensor <b>542</b>, respectively. The optical transmitter <b>544</b> may be configured to transmit optical signals to the device <b>300</b> when inserted into one of the cavities <b>412</b>, and the optical sensor <b>542</b> may be configured to receive optical signals or feedback from the device <b>300</b> in the cavity <b>412</b>. In some cases, only the optical transmitter <b>544</b> may be employed, and the optical sensor <b>542</b> may be omitted.</p>
<p id="p-0123" num="0122">The optical transmitter <b>544</b> and optical sensor <b>542</b> (if employed) of each testing module <b>410</b> may be placed proximate to the cavity <b>412</b> of the corresponding testing module <b>410</b>. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>6</b></figref> shows a side view (in partial cross section) of a cavity <b>600</b> (which is one example of the cavities <b>412</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b></figref>) to illustrate how the optical transmitter <b>544</b> and the optical sensor <b>542</b> may be arranged in one example. The cavity <b>600</b> has an opening <b>602</b> at a proximal end thereof, and a distal end of the cavity <b>600</b> may be enclosed (e.g., within structures of the corresponding testing module <b>410</b>). In this regard, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>6</b></figref> shows a power unit <b>610</b> of an instance of the device <b>300</b> inserted into the cavity <b>600</b> via the opening <b>602</b>. Notably, a portion of the power unit <b>610</b> extends out of the cavity <b>600</b> (i.e., out of the opening <b>602</b>) to enable the operator to manually remove the power unit <b>610</b> from the cavity <b>600</b> after testing is completed.</p>
<p id="p-0124" num="0123">Upon insertion of the power unit <b>610</b> into the cavity <b>600</b>, an electrical connection may be made between an electrical interface <b>620</b> (e.g., connection pins) located in the distal end of the cavity <b>600</b> and power pins <b>630</b> of the power unit <b>610</b>. As noted above, the power unit <b>610</b> may have a unique ID associated therewith. In some example embodiments, the unique ID may automatically be read or extracted from the power unit <b>610</b> responsive to connection of the power pints <b>630</b> and the electrical interface <b>620</b>. In some cases, insertion of the power unit <b>610</b> into the cavity <b>600</b>, and the corresponding connection of the electrical interface <b>620</b> of the testing module <b>410</b> to the power pins <b>630</b> of the power unit <b>610</b> may also or alternatively automatically initiate a locking sequence to lock the power unit <b>610</b> (i.e., to lock the lock assembly <b>360</b>). For example, the connection of the electrical interface <b>620</b> to the power pins <b>630</b> may trigger (e.g., via instruction by the PSA board <b>540</b> or the processor <b>502</b>) the sending of a lock instruction to lock the lock assembly <b>360</b> via the connection. Although the power unit <b>610</b> may already be in a locked state, the provision of the lock instruction may ensure that regardless of the state of the power unit <b>610</b>, the state is set to locked by default upon insertion of the power unit <b>610</b> into the cavity <b>600</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0125" num="0124">The insertion of the power unit <b>610</b> into the cavity <b>600</b> may also align the optical transmitter <b>544</b> with an aperture <b>640</b> formed in a body or housing of the power unit <b>610</b>. An optical receiver of the power unit <b>610</b> may be aligned with the aperture <b>640</b> to receive optical signals transmitted by the optical transmitter <b>544</b>. To the extent the optical sensor <b>542</b> is employed, the optical sensor <b>542</b> may also be aligned with a status light <b>650</b> of the power unit <b>610</b>. The status light <b>650</b> may provide a pattern, color or other light output that may indicate status or status changes of the power unit <b>610</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0126" num="0125">In an example embodiment, the processing circuitry <b>500</b> may manage operation of the PSA board <b>540</b> (and more particularly of the optical transmitter <b>544</b> and the optical sensor <b>542</b>) for the provision of an unlock instruction via the optical transmitter <b>544</b>. For example, after the lock instruction is sent, a delay of a predetermined time may be initiated and, when expired, the optical transmitter <b>544</b> may provide an unlock code via optical signaling that comprises the unlock instruction delivered through the aperture <b>640</b> to an optical receiver of the power unit <b>610</b>. If the unlock code is properly received by the power unit <b>610</b>, the power unit <b>610</b> will switch to the lock assembly <b>360</b> to the unlocked state. Switching to the unlocked state may cause a feedback or status signal to be generated by the status light <b>650</b> of the power unit <b>610</b>. The optical sensor <b>542</b> may detect the feedback or status signal from the status light <b>650</b> indicating the unlocking of the power unit <b>610</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0127" num="0126">Responsive to determining that the power unit <b>610</b> has been successfully transitioned to the unlocked state, the processing circuitry <b>500</b> may provide an indication to the status panel <b>414</b> and/or the display <b>440</b> to indicate that the functional test of the power unit <b>610</b> has passed (e.g., via a green light or other pass indication). The processing circuitry <b>500</b> may then further direct transitioning the power unit <b>610</b> back to the locked state (e.g., via the connection of the electrical interface <b>620</b> to the power pins <b>630</b> as described above). If the feedback or status signal from the status light <b>650</b> of the power unit <b>610</b> does not indicate that the power unit <b>610</b> successfully transitioned to the unlocked state, the processing circuitry <b>500</b> may provide an indication to the status panel <b>414</b> and/or the display <b>440</b> to indicate that the functional test of the power unit <b>610</b> has failed (e.g., via a red light or other fail indication).</p>
<p id="p-0128" num="0127"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>6</b></figref> shows the optical transmitter <b>544</b> and the optical sensor <b>542</b> both disposed on a top portion of the cavity <b>600</b>. However, the optical transmitter <b>544</b> and the optical sensor <b>542</b> could alternatively both be located on either side or the bottom portion of the cavity <b>600</b>. Moreover, in some cases, the optical transmitter <b>544</b> and the optical sensor <b>542</b> could be on different sides of the cavity <b>600</b>. For example, the optical transmitter <b>544</b> could be located at the top portion of the cavity <b>600</b> and the optical sensor <b>542</b> may be located at the bottom portion of the cavity <b>600</b>. The structure of the power unit <b>610</b> (and location of the aperture <b>640</b> and status light <b>650</b>) will typically dictate the locations of the optical transmitter <b>544</b> and the optical sensor <b>542</b> within the cavity <b>600</b>. In some cases, the cavity <b>600</b> may also include one or more shielding structures (e.g., a wall or other physical separator) aimed at ensuring that the light signals transmitted by or to the optical transmitter <b>544</b> and the optical sensor <b>542</b> are not visible at the other one of the optical transmitter <b>544</b> or the optical sensor <b>542</b>. In other words, the shielding structures may isolate each respective component from the other to avoid interference.</p>
<p id="p-0129" num="0128">Although <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>6</b></figref> illustrates the aperture <b>640</b> and the status light <b>650</b> being spaced apart from each other along the longitudinal length of the power unit <b>610</b>, such spacing need not be provided in all cases. When such spacing exists, as noted above, the optical transmitter <b>544</b> and the optical sensor <b>542</b> may also be equally spaced apart along the longitudinal length of the cavity <b>600</b>. As an alternative, the aperture <b>640</b> and status light <b>650</b> may be collocated or adjacent to each other. In such examples, the PSA board <b>700</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>7</b></figref> may be employed.</p>
<p id="p-0130" num="0129">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>7</b></figref>, the PSA board <b>700</b> may include a light ring <b>710</b> upon which a plurality of LEDs <b>720</b> may be placed. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>7</b></figref> shows six LEDs <b>720</b> provided on the light ring <b>710</b>. However, more or fewer LEDs <b>720</b> could be included in alternative embodiments. The light ring <b>710</b> and the LEDs <b>720</b> may form the optical transmitter <b>544</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>5</b> and <b>6</b></figref>. The PSA board <b>700</b> may also include a pair of phototransistors <b>730</b>. However, a single phototransistor or multiple additional phototransistors may be employed in some alternatives. The phototransistors <b>730</b> may form the optical sensor <b>542</b>. In this example, the light ring <b>710</b> surrounds the phototransistors <b>730</b>. This supports a concentric collocation of the optical transmitter <b>544</b> and the optical sensor <b>542</b>. However, other arrangements (e.g., adjacent) could alternatively be employed.</p>
<p id="p-0131" num="0130">Some example embodiments may provide a test fixture that can be used to test aerosol provision devices prior to packaging, shipping or otherwise distributing such devices with respect to each devices ability to properly be unlocked using the PSA techniques defined for the devices. The test fixture may include a housing, a plurality of testing modules disposed at the housing where each of the testing modules includes a cavity configured to receive a portion of an aerosol provision device, and processing circuitry operably coupled to the testing modules. Each of the testing modules may be configured to interface with a lock assembly of a respective one of the aerosol provision devices to transition the lock assembly between a locked and unlocked state during a functional test controlled by the processing circuitry. The processing circuitry may be configured to conduct the functional test of at least two of the testing modules simultaneously. Notably, however, the lock assembly is just one example of an assembly that may be transitioned using the test fixture described above. Thus, more generally, the locked and unlocked states should be understood to be examples of transitions between an initial state and a transitioned state. Accordingly, as used herein, the terms locked state and unlocked state are examples of states between which the test fixture may be configured to transition one or more assemblies (such as the lock assembly). Other assemblies and other states may also be included in example embodiments without departing from the spirit and scope of the disclosure provided herein, and the corresponding claims.</p>
