<heading id="h-0001" level="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<heading id="h-0002" level="1">1. Field of the Invention</heading>
<p id="p-0002" num="0001">The present invention is directed to a cabinet assembly, and in particular, to a modular cabinet assembly that can be assembled from a plurality of sub-cabinets,</p>
<heading id="h-0003" level="1">2. Description of the Prior Art</heading>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">A cabinet is usually large in size, so it is normally manufactured in component parts to facilitate cost-effective storage, packing and shipping. Existing cabinets usually have side boards, cabinet doors, a back board, a top board and a bottom board that are disassembled and then stacked together, and only connected when needed. Most of the cabinets are usually in a shape of a cube having a height generally much larger than the left and right widths, and the left and right widths generally larger than front and back widths, resulting in very large differences among the sizes of the components and accordingly not being conducive to packaging, storage and transportation. The size of the cabinet after being disassembled and stacked is at least the same as that of the back board, so that the cabinet has a large occupied area and is also not very convenient for carrying around. Moreover, the existing cabinets require users to respectively assemble and fix the components one by one before use, in which the assembly can be very complicated, time-consuming and also subject to error, so that these cabinets are not convenient to use.</p>
<heading id="h-0004" level="1">SUMMARY OF THE DISCLOSURE</heading>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">In order to solve the above problems, an object of the present invention is to provide a cabinet which is not only convenient for storage, transportation and packaging, but can also be conveniently assembled or carried around.</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">The present invention provides a modular cabinet assembly having at least a first sub-cabinet and a second sub-cabinet. Each sub-cabinet includes a back board having at least two separate back board pieces that are pivotably connected to each other, a left side board pivotably connected to one of the at least two back board pieces, and a right side board pivotably connected to another of the at least two back board pieces. At least one shelf board having opposite ends is removably connected to the left side board and the right side board of either the first sub-cabinet or the second sub-cabinet. A first end board is connected to either an upper end of the first sub-cabinet or a lower end of the second sub-cabinet. A first connector removably connects the left side boards of the first and second sub-cabinets, and a second connector removably connects the right side boards of the first and second sub-cabinets.</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">The present invention provides a number of important benefits. The main cabinet is formed by connecting several sub-cabinets together from the top down, so that the overall space occupied by the back board and the side boards after being disassembled can be effectively reduced. Meanwhile, the back board is formed by pivoting a left back board and a right back board together, so that the back board can be folded in half during disassembly, so as to further reduce the space occupied by the disassembled cabinet so that the entire assembly is convenient for carrying, storage, packing and transportation. In addition, the two side boards are respectively pivoted on the left and right sides of the back board, and all of the two side boards, the left back board and the right back board can rotate about the pivot shafts thereof to be folded during disassembly and folding. During assembly, the two side boards, the left back board and the right back board only need to be quickly unfolded and properly fixed, thereby greatly efficient facilitating disassembly and assembly of the cabinet, making the cabinet easy to use.</p>

On the other hand, the two side boards <b>12</b> are respectively pivoted on the left and right sides of the back board <b>11</b>, during disassembly and folding, so that all of the two side boards <b>12</b>, the left back board <b>111</b>, and the right back board <b>112</b>, can pivot or rotate around the pivot shafts thereof to be folded. During assembly, the two side boards <b>12</b>, the left back board <b>111</b> and the right back board <b>112</b> can be easily and simply unfolded and properly fixed in place, thereby greatly facilitating disassembly and assembly of the cabinet.</p>
<p id="p-0018" num="0017">In the present invention, the first pivot shaft <b>21</b> is a rotating shaft of a first piano hinge <b>23</b> having two connecting sheets that are respectively fixed on an inner end wall of the back board <b>11</b> and along a rear edge of a side board <b>12</b>. In addition, the left and right side walls of the back board <b>11</b> are respectively abutted to the inner end walls of the side boards <b>12</b>. The second pivot shaft <b>22</b> is a rotating shaft of a second piano hinge <b>24</b> and positioned between the right side wall of the left back board <b>111</b> and the left side wall of the right back board <b>112</b>. In this way, during folding, the two side boards <b>12</b>, the left back board <b>111</b> and the right back board <b>112</b> can be folded in an M shape, so that the structure on the inner wall can be prevented from being exposed, and so as to minimize bump damage to the internal structure of the cabinet, while maintaining an aesthetic appearance. During unfolding, the rotating angles of the two side boards <b>12</b>, the left back board <b>111</b> and the right back board <b>112</b> can be limited by the surfaces of the respective boards <b>111</b>, <b>112</b> and <b>12</b>, so that it is convenient for unfolding and folding, and the structural strength of the cabinet can also be improved.</p>
<p id="p-0019" num="0018">The present invention further includes at least one transverse end board (e.g., boards <b>13</b> and <b>14</b> described below) mounted on the main cabinet, and a connecting board <b>15</b> that is adapted to be connected to an end board is provided on the main cabinet. Each end board has an inner surface that is adapted to be abutted to the connecting board <b>15</b>, and at least one clamping hole <b>32</b> is formed on the connecting board <b>15</b>. See <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b></figref>. Each clamping hole <b>32</b> has a varying-shape cross-section with a larger end and a smaller end. A clamp <b>31</b> (which is adapted to be coupled to a corresponding clamping hole <b>32</b>) is provided on the end board and includes an elastic clamping portion <b>311</b> which is spaced with a distance from the edge of the end board. See <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>6</b></figref>. The clamping portion <b>311</b> and the smaller end of the clamping hole <b>32</b> are longitudinally aligned, then the end board (e.g., <b>14</b> in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>6</b></figref>) is clamped together with the connecting board <b>15</b> to fix the end board to the main cabinet. The end board may transversely slide relative to the connecting board <b>15</b>, to enable the clamping portion <b>311</b> and the larger end of the clamping hole <b>32</b> to be aligned, and the clamping portion <b>311</b> may longitudinally pass through the larger end of the clamping hole <b>32</b>. In this way, during unfolding and assembly, the end boards can be aligned to be mounted on the main cabinet, simply by aligning each clamping portion <b>311</b> on the end board and the larger end of the corresponding clamping hole <b>32</b> and then longitudinally inserting the clamping portion <b>311</b> into the larger end of the clamping hole <b>32</b>, and then by pushing the end board to transversely move relative to the main cabinet, to enable the clamping portions <b>311</b> to transversely move to the smaller end of the corresponding clamping holes <b>32</b>. During disassembly, only the reverse operation is required, so that the end board is pushed to transversely move relative to the main cabinet, to enable the clamping portions <b>311</b> to transversely move from the smaller end of the corresponding clamping holes <b>32</b> to the larger end of the clamping holes <b>32</b> from which the clamping portions <b>311</b> can be removed.</p>
<p id="p-0020" num="0019">Thus, when compared with a traditional screw fixing connection, there is no need to align and screw down multiple screws one by one, thereby making it very convenient to disassemble and assemble the cabinet in a time-saving manner, while also minimizing the likelihood of assembly error. In this embodiment, there are two end boards which are respectively a top board <b>13</b> mounted on the top of the main cabinet, and a bottom board <b>14</b> mounted at the bottom of the main cabinet. In actual use, the number of connections and the mounting positions of the end boards can be flexibly adjusted as required, In addition, the locations of the clamp <b>31</b> and clamping hole <b>32</b> can be reversed, with the clamp <b>31</b> provided on the main cabinet, and the clamping hole <b>32</b> provided on the end board.</p>
<p id="p-0021" num="0020">As best shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b></figref>, the larger end of the clamping hole <b>32</b> faces the front of the main cabinet. The clamp <b>31</b> further includes at least one connecting portion <b>312</b> configured to connect the clamping portion <b>311</b> and the connecting board <b>15</b>, and the connecting portion <b>312</b> can be abutted to the rear inner wall of the smaller end or the rear inner wall of the larger end of the clamping hole <b>32</b>, so as to restrict the distance to which the end board can slide backwards relative to the connecting board <b>15</b>, thereby facilitating positioning of the end board during assembly. The present invention further includes at least one locking piece <b>16</b> which is detachably and fixedly connected to the main cabinet and the end board at the same time so as to restrict movement between the main cabinet and the end board to a transverse relative sliding therebetween, so that the end boards are prevented from becoming loose, disconnected and falling down, thereby improving the structural strength of the cabinet.</p>
<p id="p-0022" num="0021">The present invention further includes at least one shelf board <b>41</b> which is arranged inside the main cabinet and can be detachably suspended on the main cabinet through several hooks <b>42</b>. See <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>2</b> and <b>7</b>-<b>8</b></figref>. Each hook <b>42</b> has at least one first barb <b>421</b> opening downwardly and at least one second barb <b>422</b> opening upwardly provided thereon, and in the embodiment shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>2</b> and <b>7</b>-<b>8</b></figref>, a pair of first barbs <b>421</b> and a single second barb <b>422</b> is provided. A plurality of pairs of aligned first hook holes <b>43</b> is formed on the opposing end surfaces <b>431</b> of each side board <b>12</b>, and the first barbs <b>421</b> are adapted to be hooked in one pair of first hook holes <b>43</b> to hang the hook <b>42</b> on the main cabinet. A second hook hole <b>44</b> is formed on the bottom of the shelf board <b>41</b>, and the second barb <b>422</b> is adapted to be hooked in the second hook hole <b>44</b> to suspend the shelf board <b>41</b> on the hook <b>42</b>. In this way, the shelf board <b>41</b> can be manually disassembled and assembled without using any tools, and the structure is simple and easy to use. In this embodiment, the pairs of hook holes <b>43</b> are longitudinally spaced apart along the surfaces <b>431</b>, and the pairs of first barbs <b>421</b> can be hooked in different pairs of first hook holes <b>43</b> to change the height of the hooks <b>42</b> hanging on the surface <b>431</b>, in order to be able to flexibly and conveniently adjust the space configuration of the cabinet for convenient use.</p>
<p id="p-0023" num="0022">With reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref> and <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b></figref>, one of the two longitudinally adjacent side boards <b>12</b> is defined as a first side board <b>51</b>, and the other one is defined as a second side board <b>52</b>. The first side board <b>51</b> and the second side board <b>52</b> are fixed together through a connecting angle board <b>53</b> having a longitudinal flange <b>57</b> fixedly connected to the first side board <b>51</b> through a plurality of first transverse screws (not shown) and tightly abutted against the side end wall of the first side board <b>51</b>, and a transverse flange <b>58</b> (transverse to the longitudinal flange <b>57</b>) of the connecting angle board <b>53</b> is abutted against a bottom wall of the second side board <b>52</b>. The second side board <b>52</b> is positioned between the transverse flange <b>58</b> of the connecting angle board <b>53</b> and the first side board <b>51</b>. Positioning holes <b>521</b> are formed on the bottom wall of the second side board <b>52</b>. At least one elastic pressing member <b>54</b> is provided above the transverse flange <b>58</b> of the connecting angle board <b>53</b> and the second side board <b>52</b>, and the transverse flange <b>58</b> of the connecting angle board <b>53</b> presses the second side board <b>52</b> on the first side board <b>51</b> through the elastic pressing member <b>54</b>. Each tail of a plurality of second screws (not shown) is extended through a hole (not shown) in the pressing member <b>54</b>, a correspondingly aligned hole <b>59</b> on the transverse flange <b>58</b>, through the correspondingly aligned positioning hole <b>521</b>, and then another hole <b>56</b> on the top of the first side board <b>51</b>. This connection structure is simple and easy for processing and assembling, and can also prevent the side boards <b>12</b> from being deformed due to excessive stress.</p>
<p id="p-0024" num="0023">At least one baffle board <b>17</b>, which is located at a joint of the two longitudinally adjacent side boards <b>12</b> and fixedly connected to the side boards <b>12</b> at the same time, is provided on an outer wall of the cabinet, and the baffle board <b>17</b> covers the outside corners of the side boards <b>12</b>, in order to be able to further improve the structural strength of the cabinet, to prevent sharp edges and corners of the side boards <b>12</b> from scratching users, and to improve the safety performance of the cabinet. Moreover, in this embodiment, cabinet doors <b>61</b> are mounted on the front end of the main cabinet and supporting feet <b>62</b> mounted at the bottom of the main cabinet, which are commonly used structures in this art, so they are not described in detail.</p>
<p id="p-0025" num="0024">The cabinet of the present invention can be assembled and disassembled in a quick and convenient manner. First, the back board <b>11</b> and side boards <b>12</b> are unfolded for each sub-cabinet <b>10</b>. Next, if the user desires to stack multiple sub-cabinets <b>10</b>, then the longitudinally adjacent side boards <b>51</b> and <b>52</b> are connected together using the connecting angle board <b>53</b> in the manner described above in connection with <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>3</b> and <b>5</b></figref>. In addition, an optional bridging member <b>64</b> (see <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref>) can be positioned between the bottom edge and the top edge of adjacent back boards <b>11</b> to facilitate connection of the bottom edge and top edge to the bridging member <b>64</b>. This is done for as many sub-cabinets <b>10</b> are desired to be stacked to form the main cabinet. Third, the end boards <b>13</b> and <b>14</b> are connected in the manner described above in connection with <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>4</b> and <b>6</b></figref>. Fourth, the shelf boards <b>41</b> are connected in the manner described above in connection with <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>2</b> and <b>7</b>-<b>8</b></figref>. Finally, doors <b>61</b> are installed to the front of the main cabinet. Each door <b>61</b> can be sized and shaped to be about the same as the back boards <b>111</b> and <b>112</b> so that the doors <b>61</b> and back boards <b>111</b> and <b>112</b> can be stacked together when packed and stored.</p>
<p id="p-0026" num="0025">To disassemble the main cabinet, the doors <b>61</b> are first uninstalled and removed. Next, the shelf boards <b>41</b> can be removed by disengaging the hooks <b>42</b> without the use of any tools. The end boards <b>13</b> and <b>14</b> are also removed without the need to use any tools as the clamps <b>31</b> can be conveniently and quickly slid out of the corresponding clamping holes <b>32</b>. Finally, the longitudinally adjacent side boards <b>51</b> and <b>52</b> are separated from the connecting angle board <b>53</b> by unscrewing the screws that extend through the aligned holes in the pressing member <b>54</b>, the transverse flange <b>58</b>, and the first side board <b>51</b>. The side boards <b>12</b> and the back boards <b>111</b> and <b>112</b> can then be folded via their pivot shafts <b>21</b> and <b>22</b>.</p>
