<heading id="h-0002" level="1">TECHNICAL FIELD</heading>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">This disclosure relates to a fit system configured to couple to a helmet, whereby the safety and comfort of the user are improved. The helmet fit system can be employed wherever a conventional helmet is used with additional benefits as described herein.</p>
<heading id="h-0003" level="1">BACKGROUND</heading>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">Protective headgear and helmets have been used in a wide variety of applications and across a number of industries including sports, athletics, construction, mining, military defense, and others, to prevent damage to a user's head and brain. Damage and injury to a user can be prevented or reduced by helmets that prevent hard objects or sharp objects from directly contacting the user's head. Damage and injury to a user can also be prevented or reduced by helmets that absorb, distribute, or otherwise manage energy of an impact.</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">For helmet-wearing athletes in many applications, such as sports, beyond the safety aspects of the protective helmet, additional considerations can comprise helmet fit and airflow through the helmet. Improvements in fit comfort and airflow can reduce distractions to the athlete and thereby improve performance. The multi-body helmet construction and a strap attachment device, as disclosed in this document, relate to safety, as well as improvements in fit, airflow, and comfort without reducing safety for customers.</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">An aspect of providing a proper fit between a user's head and the helmet can comprise a fit system wrapping around the rear of the head near the occipital bun. Current fit systems can feel hot to the user because much or all of the fit system contacts the user's head, thereby reducing the area exposed to passing air that might otherwise cool the user's head. Moreover, further improvements in the way a fit system responds to movements or jarring will improve comfort for the user.</p>
<heading id="h-0004" level="1">SUMMARY</heading>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">A need exists for an improved helmet fit system and method for providing the same. Accordingly, in an aspect, a helmet can comprise a fit system for a helmet can comprise an adjuster comprising a width adjustment track, a first pod moveably coupled to the width adjustment track with a first support arm, a second pod moveably coupled to the width adjustment track with a second support arm, the second pod comprising a lateral offset from the first pod, a dial moveably coupled to the adjustor, the first pod, and the second pod, such that movement of the dial changes a size of the lateral offset between the first pod and the second pod, and a hanger flexibly coupled to both the first pod and the second pod and adapted to allow for adjustment of the lateral offset between the first pod and the second pod. The hanger can be coupled to the adjustor through the support arms and can be adapted to allow for movement of the first pod and the second pod in a direction substantially perpendicular to the lateral offset without movement of the dial.</p>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">The helmet can further comprise the first support arm comprising a first end coupled to an outer portion of the first pod and a second end opposite the first end cantilevered away from the first pod and coupled to the width adjustment track, and the second support arm comprising a first end coupled to an outer portion of the second pod and a second end opposite the first end cantilevered away from the second pod and coupled to the width adjustment track. The hanger can comprise a first portion coupled to an inner portion of the first pod, and the hanger can comprise a second portion coupled to an inner portion of the second first pod. The fit system can further comprise a belt adapted to be coupled to a helmet, the belt being adjustably coupled to the dial such that the movement of the dial changes a position of the belt with respect to the dial and further changes an adjustable inner circumference of the fit system. The lateral offset between the first pod and the second pod can comprise a distance in a range of 0-70 millimeters. The movement of the first pod and the second pod can be in a direction substantially perpendicular to the lateral offset and can comprise a distance in a range of 0-30 millimeters. A relative angle between the first pod and the first support arm can be measured in a plane comprising the lateral offset, wherein the relative angle comprises an angle in a range of 0-60 degrees.</p>
<p id="p-0009" num="0008">In other aspects, a fit system for a helmet can comprise an adjuster comprising a width adjustment track, a first pod moveably coupled to the width adjustment track with a first support arm, a second pod moveably coupled to the width adjustment track with a second support arm, the second pod comprising a lateral offset from the first pod, a dial moveably coupled to the adjustor, the first pod, and the second pod, such that movement of the dial changes a size of the lateral offset between the first pod and the second pod, and a hanger flexibly coupled to both the first pod and the second pod and adapted to allow for adjustment of the lateral offset between the first pod and the second pod.</p>
<p id="p-0010" num="0009">The fit system can further comprise the first support arm comprising a first end coupled to the first pod and a second end opposite the first end cantilevered away from the first pod and coupled to the width adjustment track, and the second support arm comprising a first end coupled to the second pod and a second end opposite the first end cantilevered away from the second pod and coupled to the width adjustment track. A belt can be adapted to be coupled to a helmet, the belt being adjustably coupled to the dial such that the movement of the dial changes a position of the belt with respect to the dial and further changes an adjustable inner circumference of the fit system. The lateral offset between the first pod and the second pod can comprise a distance in a range of 0-70 millimeters. A relative angle between the first pod and the first support arm can be measured in a plane comprising the lateral offset, wherein the relative angle comprises an angle in a range of 0-60 degrees. The fit system can further comprise a first pad coupled to a front surface of the first pod, and a second pad coupled to a front surface of the second pod. The first pod and the second pod can be adapted to move in a direction substantially perpendicular to the lateral offset for a distance in a range of 0-30 millimeters.</p>
<p id="p-0011" num="0010">In yet other aspects, a fit system for a helmet can comprise an adjuster, a first pod moveably coupled to the adjuster with a first support arm, a second pod moveably coupled to the adjuster with a second support arm, the second pod comprising a lateral offset from the first pod, and a hanger flexibly coupled to both the first pod and the second pod and adapted to allow for adjustment of the first pod and the second pod in a direction substantially perpendicular to a rearmost surface of a head of a user.</p>

<p id="p-0021" num="0020">This disclosure, its aspects and implementations, are not limited to the specific helmet or material types, or other system component examples, or methods disclosed herein. Many additional components, manufacturing and assembly procedures known in the art consistent with helmet manufacture are contemplated for use with particular implementations from this disclosure. Accordingly, for example, although particular implementations are disclosed, such implementations and implementing components may comprise any components, models, types, materials, versions, quantities, and/or the like as is known in the art for such systems and implementing components, consistent with the intended operation.</p>
<p id="p-0022" num="0021">The word &#x201c;exemplary,&#x201d; &#x201c;example,&#x201d; or various forms thereof are used herein to mean serving as an example, instance, or illustration. Any aspect or design described herein as &#x201c;exemplary&#x201d; or as an &#x201c;example&#x201d; is not necessarily to be construed as preferred or advantageous over other aspects or designs. Furthermore, examples are provided solely for purposes of clarity and understanding and are not meant to limit or restrict the disclosed subject matter or relevant portions of this disclosure in any manner. It is to be appreciated that a myriad of additional or alternate examples of varying scope could have been presented, but have been omitted for purposes of brevity.</p>
<p id="p-0023" num="0022">While this disclosure comprises a number of embodiments in many different forms, there is shown in the drawings and will herein be described in detail, particular embodiments with the understanding that the present disclosure is to be considered as an exemplification of the principles of the disclosed methods and systems, and is not intended to limit the broad aspect of the disclosed concepts to the embodiments illustrated.</p>
<p id="p-0024" num="0023">This disclosure provides a device, apparatus, system, and method for providing a dampening fit system that can adjustably improve the fit of a protective helmet on a user's head. The protective helmet can be a bike helmet used for mountain biking or road cycling, as well as be used for a skier, skater, hockey player, snowboarder, or other snow or water athlete, a football player, baseball player, lacrosse player, polo player, climber, auto racer, motorcycle rider, motocross racer, sky diver or any other athlete in a sport. Other industries also use protective headwear, such that individuals employed in other industries and work such as construction workers, soldiers, fire fighters, pilots, or types of work and activities can also use or be in need of a safety helmet, where similar technologies and methods can also be applied. Each of the above listed sports, occupations, or activities can use a helmet that comprises either single or multi-impact rated protective material base that is typically, though not always, covered on the outside by a decorative cover and comprises comfort material on at least portions of the inside, usually in the form of comfort padding.</p>
<p id="p-0025" num="0024">Generally, protective helmets, such as the protective helmets listed above, can comprise an outer shell and in inner energy-absorbing material. For convenience, protective helmets can be generally classified as either in-molded helmets or hard shell helmets. In-molded helmets can comprise one layer, or more than one layer, comprising a thin outer shell, an energy-absorbing layer or impact liner, and a comfort liner or fit liner. Hard-shell helmets can comprise a hard outer shell, an impact liner, and a comfort liner. The hard outer shell can be formed by injection molding and can comprise Acrylonitrile-Butadiene-Styrene (ABS) plastics or other similar or suitable material. The outer shell for hard-shell helmets can be made hard enough to resist impacts and punctures, and to meet the related safety testing standards, while being flexible enough to deform slightly during impacts to absorb energy through deformation, thereby contributing to energy management. Hard-shell helmets can be used as skate bucket helmets, motorcycle helmets, snow and water sports helmets, football helmets, batting helmets, catcher's helmets, hockey helmets, and can be used for BMX riding and racing. While various aspects and implementations presented in the disclosure focus on embodiments comprising in-molded helmets, the disclosure also relates and applies to hard-shell helmets.</p>
<p id="p-0026" num="0025">Fit systems comprising one or more adjusters may be added to a helmet to allow a user to adjust the fit or tension of the helmet according to preference. Some adjusters may require a user to remove the helmet to make the adjustment, and some adjusters may require a user to use two hands to adjust the fit system&#x2014;both of which can pose safety risks to a user wanting to adjust the fit system while in motion, such as riding a moving bicycle.</p>
<p id="p-0027" num="0026"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>1</b> and <b>2</b></figref> depict front and rear perspective views of a non-limiting example of a helmet or protective helmet <b>20</b>. Helmet <b>20</b>, for convenience and ease of description, and not by way of limitation, can be described as comprising an interior <b>25</b>, a front portion <b>16</b>, a rear portion <b>17</b>, a right portion <b>18</b>, and a left portion <b>19</b>, wherein the relative descriptors of front, rear, right, and left, are given relative to a position of a user wearing helmet <b>20</b>. Helmet <b>20</b> can provide energy management in controlling and directing energy resulting from collisions, impacts, and a rider falling, such as falling off, or with, a bicycle, skateboard, skis, or other sporting equipment, and coming into contact with any other object. A proper and secure fit for helmet <b>20</b> can improve or optimize energy management for the user <b>10</b> during collisions and impacts. Helmet <b>20</b> may be releasably coupled to a head of the user <b>10</b> so as to remain in place while fitting in a manner that provides user <b>10</b> both comfort and aerodynamic performance. Various users <b>10</b> will have a variety of differing head shapes and sizes <b>15</b>. In addition to the shape of helmet <b>20</b> and the shape of interior <b>25</b>, a shape and position of dampening fit system or occipital dampening fit system <b>40</b>, straps <b>30</b> and <b>32</b>, and chin straps <b>35</b> can together, help determine the overall fit of helmet <b>20</b> on the head <b>15</b> of user <b>10</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0028" num="0027">The helmet <b>20</b> can further comprise an outer shell <b>22</b> and an energy-absorbing layer or impact liner <b>24</b>, although the helmet <b>20</b> need not comprise both. For example, in some embodiments the helmet <b>20</b> can comprise the impact liner <b>24</b> without the outer shell <b>22</b>. Vents or openings <b>28</b> can be formed in the impact liner <b>24</b> and outer shell <b>22</b> to help air circulate near the head <b>15</b> of user <b>10</b>, to improve ventilation, and to cool user <b>10</b>.

<p id="p-0035" num="0034">The dampening fit system <b>40</b> can comprise an adjuster <b>60</b> coupled to belts <b>45</b> and to a frame <b>50</b>. The adjuster <b>60</b> can comprise a housing base <b>62</b> and a cover or adjuster housing cover <b>63</b> that partially encloses a dial or adjustment wheel <b>65</b>. The dampening fit system <b>40</b> can further comprise a frame <b>50</b> that can further comprise pods <b>52</b>; pads or padding <b>54</b>; support arms, fit system arms, or flex arms <b>55</b>; arm fasteners <b>59</b> (see <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b></figref>), a hanger or bridge <b>56</b>, a hanger or bridge fastener <b>57</b>, and belt guides <b>58</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0036" num="0035">The dampening fit system <b>40</b> can be configured to fit and conform to a back of the head <b>15</b> of user <b>10</b> where pads <b>54</b> can rest against the back of head <b>15</b>, approximately laterally below the occipital portion of the head <b>15</b>. Providing support against the lower back portion of head <b>15</b> can improve both a static and dynamic fit of helmet <b>20</b> by providing resistance to the helmet <b>20</b> shifting forwards. As static fit of the helmet <b>20</b> can be improved by allowing a stationary or statically resting helmet adapt to differences in user head shape and head size. A dynamic fit of the helmet <b>20</b> can be improved by providing cushioning, dampening, or both, that results from vibration or movement of the user, the helmet, or both, while the user is moving, or while external forces, such as wind, are acting on the helmet <b>20</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0037" num="0036">The adjuster <b>60</b> can adjust, and can be configured to adjust, the fit of the dampening fit system <b>40</b> by rotating dial <b>65</b> in order to increase the offset, lateral offset, or distance O between support arms <b>55</b> and pods <b>52</b>. For example, rotating dial <b>65</b> towards the right ear of user <b>10</b>, to the right, or clockwise can cause arms <b>55</b> and the pods <b>52</b> to move closer together, as depicted in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b>B</figref> to decrease a size of offset O, such as decreasing the offset O from a large or maximum offset O<b>1</b> to a small or minimum offset O<b>2</b>. In some embodiments, the offset O can comprise distances or offsets in a range of 0-70 millimeters (mm), 2-70 mm, 0-50 mm, 2-50 mm, 5-50 mm, 0-30 mm, 2-30 mm, or 3-30 mm, 0-20 mm, or 2-20 mm. Similarly, rotating dial <b>65</b> as depicted in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b>B</figref> towards the left ear of user <b>10</b>, to the left, or counterclockwise, can cause the arms <b>55</b> and the pods <b>52</b> to move farther away from each other. In alternative embodiments, rotating dial <b>65</b> counterclockwise or to the left can move the arms <b>55</b>, the pods <b>52</b> and the pads <b>54</b> closer together, while rotating dial <b>65</b> clockwise or to the right can move arms <b>55</b>, pods <b>52</b>, and pads <b>54</b> farther apart. In yet other embodiments, the dial <b>65</b> need not move rotationally, but can move linearly, such as left to right or forwards and backwards to actuate movement of the fit system <b>40</b>, including support arms <b>55</b>, pods <b>52</b>, and belt <b>45</b>. As support arms <b>55</b> and the pods <b>52</b> move closer together or farther apart, hanger <b>56</b>, including left or first portion <b>56</b><i>a </i>of hanger <b>56</b> and right or second portion <b>56</b><i>b </i>of hanger <b>56</b> can bend, flex, or deform to allow for relative movement and changes in spacing or distance between the arms <b>55</b> and the pods <b>52</b>, such as changes in the offset O.</p>
<p id="p-0038" num="0037">In some instances, the dial <b>64</b> and the pods <b>52</b> can be separately adjustable such that the dial <b>65</b> can adjust only the relative position of the belt <b>45</b> with respect to the dial <b>64</b>, thereby changing the size of the adjustable inner circumference <b>46</b> without adjusting a position of pods <b>52</b> within the width adjustment track <b>64</b> to change the offset O. The position of the pods <b>52</b> within the width adjustment track <b>64</b> can be independent of the dial <b>64</b> such that the position of the pods <b>52</b> are manually adjusted, such as by a hand or a person or user, with sufficient force to move the pods <b>52</b> past the detents <b>80</b> of the adjustment track <b>64</b>.</p>

While the arm fastener <b>59</b> is shown at the second end <b>71</b> of the support arm <b>55</b>, in some embodiments the arm fastener <b>59</b> can be coupled at a central portion of the support arm <b>55</b>. The arm fastener can be adapted or configured to be releasably or permanently coupled to a portion of the adjuster <b>60</b>, such as width adjustment track <b>64</b>. The width adjustment track <b>64</b> can be configured to receive, or mateably couple with, a portion of the support arms <b>59</b>. In some embodiments, the width adjustment track <b>64</b> can include a number of detents, prongs, bays, notches, compartments, or divots <b>80</b>, that will allow, and are adapted to receive, the arm fasteners <b>59</b> at discrete or continuous increments, points, or offsets <b>82</b>, such as at increments of every 5 mm, or other desirable distance, such as at 2 mm, 3 mm, 4 mm, 5 mm, 6 mm, 7 mm, 8 mm, 9 mm, or 10 mm, plus or minus up to 1 mm.</p>
<p id="p-0043" num="0042"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b></figref> also shows an angle &#x3b8; that can be measured as the angle between the plane defined by pod <b>52</b> and the plane defined by support arm <b>55</b>.

While the angle &#x3b8; can remain constant or substantially the same for a single user <b>10</b>, while the user is in a single position, the angle &#x3b8; can change when the rider changes position, such as going into a tucked riding position. For example, by going into a tucked position, a size or effective circumference of the head <b>15</b> of the user <b>10</b> can increase, and a smaller angle &#x3b8; can accommodated the shift or increase in head size. Similarly, the angle &#x3b8; can change among riders of different head shapes and sizes. For example, the angle &#x3b8; can change and be larger for users <b>10</b> with rounder or more circular head shapes, and the angle &#x3b8; can be larger for a more oval shaped head for a given or fixed offset O between pods <b>52</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0044" num="0043">Aside from the angle &#x3b8;, the shape, length, and material selection for cantilevered support arm <b>55</b> and pod <b>52</b> may also affect the way movements are dampened by dampening fit system <b>40</b>, the degree of improved air circulation, or both. In some instances, support arm <b>55</b> may be approximately 5 cm in length, or in a range of 2-7 cm in length.

The adjuster <b>60</b> may be loosened incrementally, tightened incrementally, or both, proportionate to the amount of rotation of the dial <b>65</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0049" num="0048">Other embodiments may employ an adjuster <b>60</b> configured to tighten, loosen, or both, a cable and drum of a dampening fit system <b>40</b> with a rotation of a dial <b>65</b> of the adjuster <b>60</b>. Rotating the dial <b>65</b> in a first direction can wind one or more cables around a drum, which can tighten the fit of the helmet <b>20</b>. The adjuster <b>60</b> may also comprise teeth configured to prevent or limit slipping and loosening of the adjuster <b>60</b> when the user <b>10</b> wants it to remain tight. Rotating the dial <b>65</b> in a second direction can loosen the adjuster <b>60</b> by raising the drum away from a set of teeth configured to retain the drum and prevent its rotation in the second direction. The drum can be operable to rotate in the second direction and unwind one or more cables from the drum, which can loosen the dampening fit system <b>40</b>. The adjuster <b>60</b> may be loosened incrementally, tightened incrementally, or both, proportionate to the amount of rotation of the dial <b>65</b>. In further embodiments, an adjuster <b>60</b> may tighten, loosen, or both, a capstan, a band and drum, a worm and gear, a screw and nut, or any other suitable mechanism.</p>
<p id="p-0050" num="0049">Accordingly, the dampening fit system <b>40</b> can be configured to dampen movement between helmet <b>20</b> and head <b>15</b> and promote increased ventilation of air by reducing the surface area in contact with head <b>15</b>. The angle &#x3b8; between cantilevered support arm <b>55</b> and pod <b>52</b> combined with the flexibility and material properties of frame <b>50</b> can allow for dampening of movements between head <b>15</b> and helmet <b>20</b>. Additionally, adjuster <b>60</b> can be lifted away from head <b>15</b>, reducing the surface area in contact with head <b>15</b>, and thereby promoting increased air circulation that can dissipate heat better than existing designs. Further, the cantilevered shape of support arm <b>55</b> and pod <b>52</b> provide a spring-like effect in a manner that reduces the risk of catching hair within the spring mechanism (especially when compared to coiled springs). Constructing dampening fit system <b>40</b> to comprise a distance <b>48</b> can also improve comfort of user <b>10</b> by increasing air circulation through reduces surface area in contact with head <b>15</b> and may improve movement and dampening behavior over existing designs.</p>
