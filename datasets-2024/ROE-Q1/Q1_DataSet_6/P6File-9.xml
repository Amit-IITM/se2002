<p id="p-0003" num="0002">This application relates to the field of electronic vaporization technologies, and in particular, to a vaporization core, a vaporizer, and an electronic vaporization device.</p>
<heading id="h-0003" level="1">BACKGROUND</heading>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">In the related art, an electronic vaporization device mainly includes a vaporizer and a body component. The vaporizer generally includes a liquid storage cavity and a vaporization component, where the liquid storage cavity is configured to store a vaporizable medium, and the vaporization component is configured to heat and vaporize the vaporizable medium, to form vapor for an inhaler to inhale. The body component is configured to supply power to the vaporizer.</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">When the vaporizer vaporizes the vaporizable medium, the vaporizable medium is consumed at a fast speed, and an air pressure of the liquid storage cavity is reduced, which results in poor liquid supply to the vaporization assembly, so that the vaporizable medium fails to be quickly replenished to the vaporization assembly. As a result, the vaporization assembly dry burns and is overheated, resulting in damage to the vaporization assembly due to the poor liquid supply, a burnt smell, and harmful substances.</p>
<heading id="h-0004" level="1">SUMMARY</heading>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">In an embodiment, the present invention provides a vaporization core applied to an electronic vaporization device, comprising: a porous substrate comprising a liquid guide part that has a liquid absorbing surface configured to absorb a liquid substrate and a vaporization surface on which a heating element is disposed, the liquid guide part being configured to conduct the liquid substrate on a side of the liquid absorbing surface to the vaporization surface; the heating element; and a vent part connected to the liquid guide part, the vent part having a hydrophobic ventilation characteristic, the vent part comprising an air inlet surface and an air outlet surface, the air inlet surface being configured to contact gas, the air outlet surface being configured to be exposed to a liquid storage cavity, and the vent part being configured to conduct gas on a side of the air inlet surface to the air outlet surface.</p>

<p id="p-0029" num="0028">In an embodiment, the present invention provides a vaporization core, a vaporizer, and an electronic vaporization device, so as to resolve the problem that liquid supply by the electronic vaporization device is not smooth.</p>
<p id="p-0030" num="0029">In an embodiment, the present invention provides a vaporization core applied to an electronic vaporization device. The vaporization core includes a porous substrate and a heating element; and the porous substrate includes: a liquid guide part that has a liquid absorbing surface for absorbing a liquid substrate and a vaporization surface on which the heating element is disposed, where the liquid guide part is configured to conduct a liquid substrate on the side of the liquid absorbing surface to the vaporization surface; and a vent part connected to the liquid guide part, where the vent part has a hydrophobic ventilation characteristic, the vent part includes an air inlet surface and an air outlet surface, the air inlet surface is configured to contact gas, the air outlet surface is configured to be exposed to a liquid storage cavity, and the vent part is configured to conduct gas on the side of the air inlet surface to the air outlet surface.</p>
<p id="p-0031" num="0030">In an embodiment, the present invention provides a vaporizer. The vaporizer includes the foregoing vaporization core. A liquid storage cavity and a vaporization cavity are formed in the vaporizer, a liquid absorbing surface and an air outlet surface are exposed to a liquid substrate in communication with the liquid storage cavity, a vaporization surface is exposed to the vaporization cavity, and an air inlet surface is exposed to gas in communication with the vaporization cavity.</p>
<p id="p-0032" num="0031">In an embodiment, the present invention provides an electronic vaporization device. The electronic vaporization device includes a power supply component and the foregoing vaporizer, where the power supply component is electrically connected to the vaporizer, and is configured to supply power to the vaporization core of the vaporizer.</p>
<p id="p-0033" num="0032">Beneficial effects of this application are as follows: Different from the prior art, this application discloses a vaporization core, a vaporizer, and an electronic vaporization device. By defining that the porous substrate of the vaporization core includes the liquid guide part and the vent part, where the vent part has a hydrophobic ventilation characteristic, so that when the liquid guide part guides the liquid in the liquid storage cavity from the liquid absorbing surface to the vaporization surface, the external gas may be guided to the liquid storage cavity by using the vent part, so as to resolve the problem that liquid discharge is not smooth because air pressure in the liquid storage cavity is too low when the vaporization core guides the liquid, thereby facilitating a return rise of the air pressure in the liquid storage cavity and enabling the liquid to be smoothly guided to the vaporization surface from the liquid absorbing surface. Therefore, the vaporization core provided in this application can supply air to the liquid storage cavity on the side of the liquid absorbing surface, thereby improving an air pressure condition of the liquid storage cavity, so as to avoid the case that liquid discharge is not smooth due to a low air pressure in the liquid storage cavity.</p>
<p id="p-0034" num="0033">The technical solutions in embodiments of this application are clearly and completely described in the following with reference to the accompanying drawings in the embodiments of this application.

An accommodating cavity <b>262</b> for accommodating a part of the vaporization core <b>30</b> is formed in the accommodating part <b>26</b>, and the vaporization core <b>30</b> is partially accommodated in the accommodating cavity <b>262</b>. The accommodating part <b>26</b> communicates with the guide part <b>22</b> and cooperates with a first surface <b>321</b> of the vaporization core <b>30</b>, so that the liquid inlet hole <b>222</b> is in fluid communication with the vaporization core <b>30</b>, so that the e-liquid in the liquid inlet hole <b>222</b> can be delivered to the vaporization core <b>30</b> by using the guide part <b>22</b>.

<p id="p-0041" num="0040">In this embodiment, the liquid inlet hole <b>222</b> and the air outlet hole <b>224</b> are disposed on an end face of the base <b>20</b> near the liquid storage cavity <b>12</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0042" num="0041">The liquid inlet hole <b>222</b> communicates opposite two end surfaces of the guide part <b>22</b>, so that the e-liquid in the liquid storage cavity <b>12</b> flows into the vaporization core <b>30</b> through the liquid inlet hole <b>222</b>. The air outlet hole <b>224</b> communicates the end face of the guide part <b>22</b> with the side surface thereof, and the vaporized vapor flows into the side surface of the guide part <b>22</b> with air flow, and further flows out through the air outlet hole <b>224</b> and the vapor passage <b>14</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0043" num="0042">In this embodiment, the base <b>20</b> having the liquid inlet hole <b>222</b> and the air outlet hole <b>224</b> is formed as an integrated structure, and the liquid inlet hole <b>222</b> and the air outlet hole <b>224</b> are simultaneously formed on the guide part <b>22</b>, thereby further improving utilization of the guide part <b>22</b>, and making the structure of the vaporizer <b>100</b> more compact.</p>
<p id="p-0044" num="0043">There may be only one liquid inlet hole <b>222</b> and one air outlet hole <b>224</b>, or there may be one liquid inlet hole <b>222</b> and a plurality of air outlet holes <b>224</b>, a plurality of liquid inlet holes <b>222</b> and one air outlet hole <b>224</b>, or there are a plurality of liquid inlet holes <b>222</b> and air outlet holes <b>224</b> at the same time.

<p id="p-0046" num="0045">An advantage of setting the shape of the liquid inlet hole <b>222</b> to a non-circular hole is that the non-circular hole can prevent a liquid film from being generated when the e-liquid enters the liquid inlet hole <b>222</b>, so as to ensure fluency of conveying the e-liquid, and avoid a phenomenon of dry burning or a decrease in a vapor amount during continuous suction. The liquid film means that when the e-liquid flows into the liquid inlet hole <b>222</b>, a bubble film is formed at the opening of the liquid inlet hole <b>222</b>, and blocks the liquid inlet hole <b>222</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0047" num="0046">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>6</b></figref>, the internal surface of the air outlet hole <b>224</b> is disposed to include an arc-shaped surface, so as to increase a stay time of vapor in the air outlet hole <b>224</b>, thereby effectively reducing the temperature of converted vapor, and preventing an excessive temperature when the vapor flows out of the air outlet hole <b>224</b> and the vapor passage <b>14</b>, thereby causing burns.</p>

The vent part <b>325</b> has a hydrophobic ventilation characteristic. The hydrophobic characteristic is for a liquid substrate to be vaporized herein. As long as the liquid substrate to be vaporized has the hydrophobic characteristic, it is the hydrophobic characteristic described herein.

The heating element <b>34</b> disposed on the second surface <b>322</b> vaporizes the e-liquid to form vapor in the vaporization cavity <b>41</b>, and the vapor flows through the side surface and the air outlet hole <b>224</b> of the guide part <b>22</b>, flows out of the vapor passage <b>14</b>, and is guided to the mouth of the user through the vapor passage <b>14</b>. The second surface <b>322</b> is the surface of the side of the porous substrate <b>32</b> facing away from the liquid storage cavity <b>12</b>, and the air inlet hole <b>46</b> on the bottom bottom wall <b>42</b> is in fluid communication with the outside, so that an external air flow is sent from the air inlet hole <b>46</b> to the vaporization cavity <b>41</b>, that is, the air flow takes away vapor generated by vaporization at the second surface <b>322</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0075" num="0074">The e-liquid in the liquid storage cavity <b>12</b> is continuously consumed as the user smokes, and the e-liquid in the liquid storage cavity <b>12</b> is reduced, thereby reducing air pressure in the liquid storage cavity <b>12</b>. If this is not improved in a timely manner, it is easy to cause poor e-liquid discharge when the e-liquid in the liquid storage cavity <b>12</b> passes through the porous substrate <b>32</b>, thereby causing the heating element <b>34</b> to dry burn and generate scorched flavor due to a liquid supply failure. Because the vent part <b>325</b> exists, when the internal and external pressure difference of the liquid storage cavity <b>12</b> is excessively large, air may be introduced from one side of the second surface <b>322</b> to the first surface <b>321</b> by using the vent part <b>325</b>, so as to improve a condition that the air pressure in the liquid storage cavity <b>12</b> is excessively low, so as to avoid excessively large internal and external pressure difference of the liquid storage cavity <b>12</b>, thereby facilitating smooth e-liquid discharge in the liquid storage cavity <b>12</b> and avoiding scorched flavor.</p>
<p id="p-0076" num="0075">For example, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>7</b></figref> to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>9</b></figref>, the vent part <b>325</b> penetrates the porous substrate <b>32</b> in the direction of pointing to the second surface <b>322</b> along the first surface <b>321</b>. Therefore, because of the hydrophobic ventilation characteristic of the vent part <b>325</b>, gas may be introduced from one side of the second surface <b>322</b> to one side of the first surface <b>321</b> along the porous structure in the vent part <b>325</b>, thereby improving the air pressure condition in the liquid storage cavity <b>12</b> and avoiding excessively large internal and external pressure difference of the liquid storage cavity <b>12</b>. The arrows in the accompanying drawings are used to indicate directions of the gas.</p>

In other words, the vent part <b>325</b> has a part of the first surface <b>321</b> and a part of the second surface <b>322</b>. Therefore, the part of the porous substrate <b>32</b> located between the air outlet surface <b>329</b> and the air inlet surface <b>328</b> does not undertake a function of conducting the e-liquid, but delivers, under a pressure difference, gas entering through the air inlet surface <b>328</b> to the air outlet surface <b>329</b>, so as to adjust the air pressure condition in the liquid storage cavity <b>12</b>. In addition, if a part of the side surface <b>324</b> is exposed to the e-liquid in communication with the liquid storage cavity <b>12</b>, the side surface <b>324</b> may be used as the liquid absorbing surface <b>326</b>, and if the vent part <b>325</b> has a part of the side surface <b>324</b>, the part of the side surface <b>324</b> may be used as the air outlet surface <b>329</b>.</p>

<p id="p-0102" num="0101">Different from the prior art, this application discloses a vaporization core, a vaporizer, and an electronic vaporization device. By defining that the porous substrate of the vaporization core includes the liquid guide part and the vent part, where the vent part has a hydrophobic ventilation characteristic, so that when the liquid guide part guides the liquid in the liquid storage cavity from the liquid absorbing surface to the vaporization surface, the external gas may be guided to the liquid storage cavity by using the vent part, so as to resolve the problem that liquid discharge is not smooth because air pressure in the liquid storage cavity is too low when the vaporization core guides the liquid, thereby facilitating a return rise of the air pressure in the liquid storage cavity and enabling the liquid to be smoothly guided to the vaporization surface from the liquid absorbing surface. Therefore, the vaporization core provided in this application can supply air to the liquid storage cavity on the side of the liquid absorbing surface, thereby improving an air pressure condition of the liquid storage cavity, so as to avoid the case that liquid discharge is not smooth due to a low air pressure in the liquid storage cavity.</p>
