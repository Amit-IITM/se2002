<heading id="h-0002" level="1">BACKGROUND</heading>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">Skin health and appearance is an important aspect of many beauty regimens. Typical skin care focuses on particular creams or lotions to be applied to the skin, usually performed manually by sponge or brush. Cleaning by hand often fails to adequately apply lotions to the skin, and can be ineffective at removing grease, oils, and other contaminants. An effective skin cleanser device should clean the face more effectively than hand cleaning, but avoid abrasions or other harsh impacts on the skin.</p>
<heading id="h-0003" level="1">SUMMARY</heading>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">A skin cleanser includes one or more oscillating motors or other electromagnetic device that can provide the skin cleanser with various frequency pulsations, and an exterior that can be composed of a soft elastic material, such as silicone, and one or more textured surfaces, including rounded touch-points of 0.5 to 2.5 mm of diameter, or solid surfaces with ridges for cleaning or otherwise interacting with the skin. The oscillating motor moves or oscillates the textured surfaces for application to a user's skin. As the user moves the skin cleanser on the skin, the oscillating pulsations combined with the textured surfaces' touch-points remove oil and other contaminants on the skin's surface. The oscillating pulsations provide a tapping motion to the user's skin to cleanse and loosen contaminants. The oscillations occur at around 50-300 Hertz (Hz). One embodiment includes a high-frequency and a low-frequency oscillating motor or other electromagnetic device that may operate simultaneously or independently. The simultaneous pulsations provide a deep cleaning to the skin. While referred to here as a skin cleanser, the device can also perform other functions besides cleansing, including massaging, exfoliating, buffing, stimulating, toning, exercising, heating, applying lotions or other substances, and so forth.</p>

<p id="p-0017" num="0016">The figures depict various embodiments of the present invention for purposes of illustration only. One skilled in the art will readily recognize from the following discussion that alternative embodiments of the structures and methods illustrated herein may be employed without departing from the principles of the invention described herein.</p>
<heading id="h-0005" level="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION</heading>
<p id="p-0018" num="0017"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref> is a cross-sectional vies of a skin cleanser, according to one embodiment. The skin cleanser directs pulsations to a user through rounded touch-points on a brush, such as silicone brush <b>100</b>. The touch-points and brush can be composed of various elastic materials, preferably materials that are soft and do not damage the skin, such as silicone. Silicone is used as an example throughout, though it is understood that other materials can be used, as well. The silicone brush <b>100</b> is made of a hygienic silicone that is fast-drying and non-absorbent, allowing the skin cleanser to be used with many skin cleaning products without wear. The silicone brush <b>100</b> and other user-contacting portions of the skin cleanser may also include active ingredients, such as vitamin E, antioxidants, or silver nanoparticles. For example, the can be coated with these ingredients by the user or pre-coated, or can have a deliver , mechanism in the brush that can store and provide these ingredients upon use. A high- or low-frequency oscillating motor <b>110</b> creates pulsations that vibrate the skin cleanser. The oscillating motor <b>110</b> in this embodiment provides vibrations between 50 and 300 Hz, though pulsation frequencies higher and lower than this range may also provide beneficial cleansing of the skin. When the skin cleanser, and the silicone brush <b>100</b> in particular, is applied to the body, such as the face or neck, the pulsations provide a thorough cleaning of the skin. The pulsations provide a tapping motion to the skin, in some embodiments, by providing impulses to the skin's surface from the silicone touch-points <b>100</b> pulsating against the skin's surface. The tapping-based cleansing provided by the silicone brush provides a deeper clean that is less abrasive than scrubbing the skin with harsher bristles of other materials (e.g., nylon brush bristles). Frequencies in this range provide deep facial cleansing of oil and dirt, unclog follicles, and stimulate blood circulation and lymph flow within the skin.</p>
<p id="p-0019" num="0018">The oscillating motor <b>110</b> is enclosed in a frame <b>120</b>, which is enclosed by a casing including a top <b>130</b> and a bottom <b>140</b> made of a suitable material, such as plastic. In some embodiments, there is more than one oscillating motor, which may vary from one another in frequency. A controller, such as a printed circuit board <b>150</b>, provides control to the oscillating motor <b>110</b>, which is powered by a battery <b>160</b>. The battery <b>160</b> is charged through a charging port, such as a DC jack <b>170</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0020" num="0019">The user interacts with the controller through controls on the exterior of the skin cleanser (such as those shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref>) or through a wireless remote. When activated by the controls, the controller initiates a high-frequency vibration of the oscillating motor <b>110</b>. The user may increase and decrease the frequency of vibration of the motor through controls to set the frequency desired by the user. The frequency set by the user may be stored by the controller when the controller is deactivated, such that the next time the controller is turned on the controller resumes the desired frequency.</p>
<p id="p-0021" num="0020"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref> is a cross-sectional view of a skin cleanser, according to one embodiment. The skin cleanser in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref> includes similar components to the skin cleanser in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>, and additional components as described. This embodiment includes a second oscillating motor <b>200</b> and a frame <b>210</b> containing the second motor <b>200</b>. In this embodiment, the second motor <b>200</b> is capable of creating vibrations at a lower frequency relative to the high-frequency oscillating motor <b>110</b>. The second motor <b>200</b>, for example, produces pulsations of 50-130 Hz. The controller in this embodiment may use the second motor <b>200</b> alone or in combination with the high-frequency motor <b>110</b> to create different vibration effects from the skin cleanser. Using the back-side of the brush, upward strokes on the skin, such as beneath the jaw line, allow the stronger combination of high-frequency and lower-frequency vibration to tone and tighten underlying musculature, such as that of the neck. Additional benefits can range from stimulating collagen synthesis in fibroblast cells to improving the flow of blood and lymphatic fluid&#x2014;the result is healthier, younger-looking skin, such as in the known problem areas of the face, and a more sharply defined profile of the face. In one embodiment, the <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref> device is a larger cleanser and the <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref> device is a smaller or mini-cleanser.</p>
<p id="p-0022" num="0021">The controller may also activate the lower-frequency motor alone. The lower-frequency vibrations (e.g., in the range of 50-130 Hertz) in conjunction with ridged silicone brush may be used by a user on the skin to relax underlying musculature. In particular, when gently applied to expression-line problem areas at the brow, temples and nasolabial folds, the skin cleanser can relax underlying muscles and reduce the appearance of dynamic wrinkles. Thus, the high-frequency oscillating motor <b>110</b> together with the second oscillating motor <b>200</b> may enable the skin cleanser to provide a variety of modes and benefits to the user. In some embodiments, the motors <b>110</b>, <b>200</b> can be used in an alternating fashion to provide alternating low and high frequency pulsations to the cleanser.</p>
<p id="p-0023" num="0022">In one embodiment, a sensor is also included in the skin cleanser near the front or back of the skin cleanser (or both). The sensor may be a pressure sensor, capacitive sensor, or similar, and detects a user's action to activate the sensor, such as by contacting the body exterior to the sensor. In one embodiment, the controller activates at least one of the oscillating motors when the sensor is activated, permitting the device to automatically activate when the user activates the sensor. Multiple sensors may be included to activate different functions. For instance, in one configuration a sensor is located underneath each textured side of the skin cleanser and detects contact with that textured side. Based on which sensor is activated, the controller activates an operational mode suitable for the side on which the sensor was activated.</p>
<p id="p-0024" num="0023">For example, activating only the low-frequency oscillating motor when one side is contacted, and simultaneously activating the low- and high-frequency oscillating motors when the other side is contacted.</p>
<p id="p-0025" num="0024"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>3</b>-<b>9</b></figref> illustrate various views of the exterior of a skin cleanser according to some embodiments. The exterior shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>3</b>-<b>9</b></figref> correspond to the internal configuration shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref>. The exterior is formed of a soft but durable elastic material, such as a hygienic silicone. The skin cleanser includes brush surfaces <b>300</b> and <b>400</b> on the front and the back of the device with varying textures, such as touch-points of 0.5-2.5 mm diameter, or solid ridged surfaces. The brush surface <b>300</b> comprises a series of thinner touch-points for gentle cleansing of non-oily or sensitive skin, with an area of thicker touch-points grouped towards the top of the cleanser. Providing more resistance than the thinner touch-points, the thicker touch-points allow for more targeted cleansing of oilier areas and hard to-reach points around the nose, ears and hairline. The pattern of touch-points presented in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>3</b>-<b>9</b></figref> is one example of a pattern that might be used to cleansing of what is commonly referred to as &#x201c;normal&#x201d; skin. Normal skin can include some areas that are drier, oilier, or more sensitive, such that the different patterns of thinner and thicker touch-points can be helpful in targeting these areas thinner touch-points for oily areas around the nose). The thinner touch-points and thicker touch-points may vary in size and spacing. In various embodiments, the thinner touch-points are 25-80% thinner (e.g., 30%, 40%, 50%, 60%, 70%, etc. or values in between) compared to the thicker touch-points. In various embodiments, the thinner touch-points are spaced closer together (i.e., the distance between touch-points) by 15%-60%. Thus, the thinner and thicker touch-points for the normal skin cleansing can also be arranged differently around the brush surface than is shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>3</b>-<b>9</b></figref>. In one embodiment, the thicker touch points are between about 1.5 mm and 2.5 mm in diameter, and the thinner touch points are between about 0.5 mm and 1.5 mm in diameter.</p>
<p id="p-0026" num="0025">The touch points and the body of the skin cleanser itself may be compressible and bendable, such that the touch points and body of the skin cleanser conform to the surface of the skin during use.</p>
<p id="p-0027" num="0026">The brush surface <b>400</b> is a series of smooth silicone ridges arranged in a wave formation, intended to provide minimal abrasion and maximize the pulsation energy transfer, and the effectiveness of the dual-frequency toning and low-frequency, muscle-relaxing functions. Thus, both surfaces <b>300</b> and <b>400</b> of the brush can be used for skin cleansing, and specifically for different applications of skin cleansing.</p>
<p id="p-0028" num="0027">The front of the skin cleanser also includes a mode control <b>310</b> and frequency controls <b>320</b>. The mode control <b>310</b> activates the skin cleanser and is used to cycle through modes of operation for the skin cleanser, such as turning the cleanser on, activating the high-frequency and second lower-frequency motor both independently or in unison, and turning the skin cleanser off. Fewer, more, or different controls may be included for other embodiments. The skin cleanser may also activate a mode that directs the user to cycle through portions of the face when applying vibrations through the skin cleanser. The base <b>330</b> of the cleanser may light up or otherwise indicate a prompt for the user to move to another portion of the face. As one example, in this mode that directs cycling through the face, the cleanser may first indicate that the user should apply the brush to the area around the cheeks for a period of time, and then may indicate that the user should apply the brush to the area around the chin, and so forth until the user has cycled throughout the face. The cleanser can indicate when it is time to switch by, for example, lighting up the base, blinking the light a certain number of times, or otherwise using the light to indicate instructions to the user. Different cleaning regimens can be used for different cleansers. For example, a sensitive skin cleanser might have a cycle that is shorter in certain areas of the face to avoid irritating the face. A user might also have a program designed specifically for the user's own skin, with shorter or longer application of the brush to different areas of the face as needed for that user's skin. The program designed for a user's skin may be assessed by the manufacturer and programmed to the controller according to a diagnostic of the users particular skincare needs.</p>
<p id="p-0029" num="0028">The brush surfaces are designed to efficiently channel the high-frequency vibrations into the skin to cleanse deeply, unblock follicles, and to boost circulation and lymph flow. By avoiding abrasive exfoliation (as used in other brush-type devices), the brush surface remains gentle enough to use for twice-daily facial cleansing or more uses in the day, as needed. Relative to other cleansing devices, this skin cleanser does not rely on a spinning or twisting action; the result is a deeper clean without the need for such abrasive scrubbing. The pulsations in combination with the textured surfaces, the elastic, soft material touch-points and the solid ridged surfaces provide thorough cleansing, since the textured surface directs the power of the high-frequency motor substantially orthogonal to the skin's surface, which unlocks the skin's natural potential. In one embodiment, the touch-points of the textured surface vertically oscillate from the brush to the skin to create a tapping motion on the skin, similar to the tapping of fingertips on the skin or the patting with a towel or cotton pad. The vertical tapping of the skin in this embodiment provides a gentle cleansing of the skin, as opposed to a rotating motion that can cause a less favorable twisting or stretching of the skin that may cause damage to or scratching of the skin surface.</p>
<p id="p-0030" num="0029">The vertical tapping motion can be generated by the vibrations of the motor or of multiple motors, or other electromagnetic device in the brush, by electromechanical mechanisms, among other means. For example, the motors can be positioned in the brush to cause the vertical oscillations of the touch-points, such as by positioning one or more motors directly under or adjacent to the textured surface of the brush. The oscillation of the motor(s) can cause each of or at least some of the touch-points to move orthogonal to the skin's surface to tap the skin. Multiple motors can be arranged near the textured surface to create different motions or different speeds of vertical oscillations across the textured surface of the skin. For example, the motors can be positioned so that different touch-point arrangements or patterns on the textured surface can oscillate differently from one another to provide one type of tapping motion for some touch-points and a different type (e.g., different speed, pattern, etc.) for other touch-points. In some embodiments, each touch-point is a single structure rather than a plurality of structures, such as might be found in a brush where each brush bristle is made up of multiple bristle components arranged as a bunch.</p>
<p id="p-0031" num="0030">The skin cleanser body can be configured to have different shapes, such as a substantially oval shape (e.g., <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>3</b>-<b>9</b></figref>), a substantially round shape (e.g., <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>17</b>-<b>18</b></figref>), and so forth, and it includes a base <b>330</b> that is substantially flat to allow the cleanser to be placed on and stand on a surface. The oval or round shape of the body allows the user to hold the cleanser in the palm of her hand, possibly with fingers splayed along the back side of the cleanser and thumb against the controls in the front side of the cleanser. In some embodiments, the cleanser is wider than it is thick, as is shown, for example, in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b></figref>. This configuration allows the user to easily hold the cleanser in the palm of her hand and reach her fingers around both side of the cleanser for easy and ergonomic manipulation of the cleanser against the skin. The body can thus have two components, the textured portions <b>300</b> and <b>400</b>, and a handle or portion for grasping or manipulating the device, which includes everything other than the textured portions <b>300</b>, <b>400</b>. The textured portion can comprise at least 10%, 20%, 30%, 40%, 50% or more of the cleanser outer surface or of the front or of the back of the cleanser outer surface. The textured portion can be positioned on an appear portion or tip of the cleanser, such as is shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>3</b>-<b>9</b></figref>, but can also be otherwise positioned (e.g., at the sides, in the middle, at the bottom, etc.).</p>
<p id="p-0032" num="0031"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>3</b>-<b>9</b></figref> provide just one example of how the touch-points on the brush can be arranged. A variety of other arrangements are also possible (e.g., thinner touch-points at the top and thicker at the bottom, thinner on one side and thicker on the other side, alternating rows of thinner and thicker, various areas or groupings of thinner and thicker in different locations on the brush, and so forth). In addition, different types of touch-points can be included, such as taller or shorter touch-points, touch-points with more or less bulbous ends, touch-points with ends of different shapes (e.g., pointed, feathered, ridged, etc.), and so forth. Similarly, the touch-points can be arranged more or less densely, can be positioned on both the front and back of the brush, can be otherwise located on the brush (e.g., only in the middle, only at the edges, etc.), among other variations. Some other examples of touch-point arrangements are shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>10</b>-<b>15</b></figref>. In addition, the ridges of brush surface <b>400</b> in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>3</b>-<b>9</b></figref> (and for <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>100</b>-<b>15</b></figref>) can be arranged on one or both sides of the brush, can be otherwise located on the brush (e.g., only in the middle, only at the edges, etc.), can be positioned with the touch-points (e.g., above or below, or intermingled within the touch-points), can be formed into other patterns or shapes or with different spacing, among other variations.</p>
<p id="p-0033" num="0032"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>10</b> and <b>11</b></figref> are views of one embodiment of a brush surface configuration for a skin cleanser. This brush configuration is specialized for men's facial skin. The brush on the front side, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>10</b></figref>, includes a series of thicker touch-points covering the whole front surface, reflecting the additional cleansing normally required for men's oilier skin, with its larger pores and facial hair that act as magnets for dirt and pollutants, making acne, blackheads and breakouts more likely to occur. Providing more resistance than the thinner touch-points, they allow for firmer, deeper cleansing to meet the challenges of a man's thicker skin. The resulting boost to the health of the skin can reduce the discomfort and irritation often associated with, for example, daily wet shaving. The brush on the back side, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>11</b></figref>, includes a series of smooth silicone ridges arranged in a wave formation, intended to provide minimal abrasion and to maximize the pulsation energy transfer and the effectiveness of the dual-frequency (high-frequency and lower-frequency motor in combination) toning and low-frequency, muscle-relaxing functions.</p>
<p id="p-0034" num="0033"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>12</b> and <b>13</b></figref> are views of one embodiment of a brush surface configuration for a skin cleanser. This brush configuration is specialized for skin with some oilier areas. The brush on the front side, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>12</b></figref>, includes a series of thinner touch-points for gentle cleansing of non-oily or sensitive skin, with an area of thicker touch-points grouped towards the top of the cleanser, as well as two additional waves of thicker touch-points. Providing less than the thinner touch-points, these allow for stronger cleansing and the targeting of oilier areas and hard to-reach points around the nose, ears and hairline. The brush on the hack side, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>13</b></figref>, includes a series of smooth silicone ridges arranged in a wave formation, intended to provide minimal abrasion and maximize the pulsation energy transfer and the effectiveness of the dual-frequency toning and low-frequency, muscle-relaxing functions.</p>
<p id="p-0035" num="0034"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>14</b> and <b>15</b></figref> are views of one embodiment of a brush surface configuration for a skin cleanser. This brush configuration is specialized for sensitive skin. The brush on the front side, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>14</b></figref>, includes a series of closely packed, smooth silicone ridges in a wave formation, designed to minimize abrasion and allow for the extra-gentle yet highly effective cleansing of even the most sensitive skin. The brush on the back side, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>15</b></figref>, includes a series of smooth silicone ridges arranged in a wave formation, intended to provide minimal abrasion and to maximize the pulsation energy transfer and the effectiveness of the dual-frequency toning and low-frequency, muscle relaxing functions. The smooth silicone ridges on the front side in one embodiment are spaced closer to one another compared to the spacing of the ridges on the back-side. The ridges on the front side may be spaced between 10-60% closer together (e.g., 20%, 30%, 40%, 50%, etc. or values in between) relative to the spacing of the ridges on the back-side. In addition, the ridges on the front side are cushioned with additional space between the soft elastic surface and the plastic casing in order to provide with extra-gentle cleansing.</p>
<p id="p-0036" num="0035"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>17</b> and <b>18</b></figref> are views of one embodiment of a brush surface configuration for a skin cleanser. This brush surface configuration corresponds to the internal configuration shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>. The brush on the front side, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>17</b></figref>, includes a series of thinner touch-points for gentle cleansing of non-oily or sensitive skin, with an area of thicker touch-points grouped towards the top of the cleanser. The brush on the back side, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>18</b></figref>, provides a series of thicker touch-points allowing a deeper clean provided by the thicker touch-points to be applied to a larger area.</p>
<p id="p-0037" num="0036"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>3</b>-<b>15</b> and <b>17</b>-<b>18</b></figref> are just some examples of different brush surface configurations matched) different skin types. Other designs for other skin types are also possible, such as a particular pattern for dry skin, for aging skin, for combination skin or T-zone skin (e.g., oilier around the forehead, nose, and chin), among others. In some embodiments, the front textured surface includes at least two different types of touch-points (e.g., thicker and thinner). The touch-points of a type can be grouped to provide a pattern. For example, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref> shows a group of thicker touch-points at the tip of the cleanser and a group of thinner touch-points below. Each pattern can correspond to a particular skin type (e.g., male, sensitive, oily, normal, etc.). In some embodiments, at least 10%, 20%, 30%, 40%, 50% of the front textured surface includes touch-points of a different type than the rest of the front textured surface.</p>
<p id="p-0038" num="0037">The brush surface can also be designed to contour to the curves of the body or face. In one embodiment, one or more surfaces of the brush, e.g., the textured surfaces, are deformable or bendable. For example, where the textured surface is composed of silicone, the surface can compress or bend when pressed against the skin to mold to the surface of the skin for providing, a deeper cleansing and for better cleaning of skin surfaces that are curved. In other embodiments, the textured surface can be designed to pivot relative to the brush or to include one or more portions that pivot such that the textured surface can mold to the shape of the skin.</p>
<p id="p-0039" num="0038"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>16</b></figref> is a skin analyzer according to one embodiment. The skin analyzer is a handheld device capable of analyzing the skin of the user. The results of the skin analysis may be provided to the user to guide use of the skin cleanser, for example by measuring effectiveness and oiliness of the skin after use. The skin analyzer is encased in a both <b>1600</b> held by the operator of the skin analyzer. The skin analyzer includes sensors <b>1610</b> that sense the skin's condition, such as oil levels, moisture content, and dead skin cell levels. The results of the skin analysis may be communicated to the user by connecting the skin analyzer to a display or by wireless communication with a display or computer to direct the user in the use of a skin cleanser, such as whether the skin cleanser is being used too frequently or to show improvement of the skin over a period of time as the skin cleanser is applied. The skin analyzer may also provide the results of the analysis via an interface to the skin cleanser, which may be used to change the suggested frequency of applying the skin cleanser to portions of the user's face during cleansing. The cleanser can also include an interface to communicate with the skin analyzer, including sending information about how often it is used, what skin regimens or programs are used. etc.</p>
<p id="p-0040" num="0039">In one embodiment, the skin analyzer can provide a diagnostic of the user's particular skincare needs, such as by indicating skin type (e.g., oily skin, oily skin in certain areas, sensitive skin, dry skin, dry in certain areas, male or female skin, normal skin, etc.) or by indicating specific details about the user's skin at different areas of the face or different times of day (e.g., tends to be dry in the morning, tends to be thin near the eye area, tends to be dry around the nose, etc.). The skin analyzer data can be used to design a program or skincare regimen specific to the user's skin. The program designed for a user's skin may be assessed by the user or by a third party, such as the manufacturer of the skin cleanser or analyzer, a beautician, a dermatologist or other medical personnel, etc. For example, information about the program can be transmitted via the interface of the skin analyzer or skin cleanser to a computer of the user or third party for review and possible revision. The program or regimen (possibly as revised by the user or third party) can be programmed to the controller of the skin cleanser according to the diagnostic of the user's particular skincare needs.</p>
<p id="p-0041" num="0040">Additional features may also be included in the skin cleanser. In one embodiment, the skin cleanser includes a heat-emitting source located between the body and the textured surfaces. The heat-emitting source, when activated by the controller, heats the textured surfaces and may be used in conjunction with the oscillations of the touch-points. In a further embodiment, the skin cleanser includes a dosing mechanism integrated in the body of the device to dispense liquids or solid suspensions, such as for the delivery of silver nanoparticles, Vitamin E, etc. as described above. The dosing mechanism may include a reservoir, for example at the base of the skin cleanser, and a pump with an outlet to dispense contents of the reservoir to the textured surfaces or near the textured surfaces.</p>
