<p id="p-0002" num="0001">This application is a national stage application, filed under 35 U.S.C. &#xa7; 371, of International Patent Application No. PCT/IB2021/055407, filed on Jun. 18, 2021, which claims priority to European patent application no. 20181250.0 filed on Jun. 19, 2020, and Italian patent application no. 102020000022039 filed on Sep. 18, 2020, the disclosures of all of which are incorporated herein by reference.</p>
<?cross-reference-to-related-applications description="Cross Reference To Related Applications" end="tail"?>
<?summary-of-invention description="Summary of Invention" end="lead"?>
<heading id="h-0002" level="1">BACKGROUND OF THE DISCLOSURE</heading>
<heading id="h-0003" level="1">1. Field of the Disclosure</heading>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">The present disclosure relates in general to the field of automatic beverage preparation machines and, in particular, to either table-top or free standing automatic beverage preparation machines provided with electromagnetic-induction, continuous-flow fluid heaters.</p>
<heading id="h-0004" level="1">2. Description of Related Art</heading>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">Automatic beverage preparation machines are known for preparing beverages, in general, and hot beverages, in particular, which are obtained by heating a fluid product which can be a liquid such as, for example, water for the preparation of coffee, tea, etc., or milk in all its types or milk-based mixtures for the preparation of hot milk, cappuccino, etc., or even gaseous such as, for example, air or gaseous mixtures used, for example, as a heating means for heating components used for the preparation of the beverages.</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">For this purpose, the known automatic beverage preparation machines are provided with a fluid product heater, which usually is in the form of either a storage heater (boilers, kettles) or a continuous-flow or through-flow heater.</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">The continuous-flow fluid heaters operate according to two different technologies: resistive heating, which is very common in the field, and electromagnetic-induction heating, which is less common in the field with respect to the former.</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">In the first technology, an electrical potential difference is applied to opposite ends of an heating element, which is directly or indirectly flown by the flow of fluid to be heated. An electric current is then generated in the heating element which, by Joule effect, dissipates energy in the form of heat, heating the fluid by conduction.</p>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">Two embodiments of this first technology are disclosed in EP 2 044 869 A1.</p>
<p id="p-0009" num="0008">In the second technology, the fluid is heated using electromagnetic-induction to generate eddy currents within a duct to be heated in which a fluid is caused to flow.</p>
<p id="p-0010" num="0009">The duct can form a nearly straight flow path when it is formed by a single tubular body made of electrically conducting material. The eddy currents dissipate energy, by Joule effect, in the form of heat, thereby heating the fluid flowing in the duct.</p>
<p id="p-0011" num="0010">Alternatively, the duct can form a &#x201c;twisting&#x201d; and, generally, a helical flow path. In this case, an insert is housed inside the tubular body and forms, along with the tubular body, the helical flow path.</p>
<p id="p-0012" num="0011">An electromagnetic-induction, continuous-flow fluid heater with a helical flow path is disclosed in Italian patent application No. 102019000007166 and in the corresponding international application No. PCT/IB2020/052950, both in the name of the present Applicant.</p>
<p id="p-0013" num="0012">In the aforementioned patent applications, the electromagnetic-induction, continuous-flow fluid heater is intended to heat water and the electromagnetic induction is generated by means of an electromagnetic-induction winding wound just around the tubular body.</p>
<p id="p-0014" num="0013">In a different embodiment, the electromagnetic induction is generated by wounding the induction winding around, but at a distance from, the tubular body.</p>
<p id="p-0015" num="0014">In other embodiments, the electromagnetic induction is generated by associating the induction winding with the insert.</p>
<p id="p-0016" num="0015">A different electromagnetic-induction, continuous-flow water heater in an automatic beverage preparation machine is disclosed in international applications WO 2015/063572A1 and WO 2017/191529 A1. The water heater comprises a metal heating duct and an electrical induction winding, the coils of which are wound around a spool made of electrically insulating material and having an inner cavity in which the metal duct is housed. The metal duct and the spool are at least partially separated by a gap inside the cavity to allow the separate maintenance of the metal duct and the electrical winding.</p>
<p id="p-0017" num="0016">In the course of experiments and tests, the Applicant has experienced the particular efficacy of the electromagnetic-induction, continuous-flow water heater which is the object of his Italian patent application No. 102019000007166 and international patent application No. PCT/IB2020/052950 for heating liquids containing fatty substances, and in particular liquid milk used in the preparation of beverages predominantly based on milk, such as hot milk and latte macchiato, and hot beverages produced by brewing brewable substances with pressurised hot water, such as coffee and tea beverages, and also containing liquid milk, hot or cold, frothed or unfrothed, for example espresso macchiato, cappuccino, etc.</p>
<p id="p-0018" num="0017">In particular, the Applicant has ascertained that this particular efficiency derives from the fact that the water heater manages to heat the liquid milk without burning the fats contained therein, thus maintaining the organoleptic properties thereof unaltered.</p>
<p id="p-0019" num="0018">The Applicant has also verified how such a water heater was able to effectively heat any type of liquid milk of natural origin, of artificial origin, of animal origin (cow, goat, sheep, donkey, buffalo, etc.), of vegetable origin, raw, fresh, pasteurised, whole, partially or totally skimmed, UHT, lactose-free, highly digestible, etc., as well as any other type of milk.</p>
<p id="p-0020" num="0019">The electromagnetic-induction, continuous-flow fluid heater for heating liquid substances or mixtures containing fatty substances is the object of the Italian patent application No. IT 102020000014692 and of the corresponding International application No. PCT/IB2021/051201, both of which are in the name of the present Applicant.</p>
<p id="p-0021" num="0020">In the end, the Applicant has also ascertained the effectiveness of the water heater which is the object of his Italian patent application No. 102019000007166 and of the International application No. PCT/IB2020/052950 for heating other types of fluids used in automatic beverage preparation machines, for example gases or gaseous mixtures, in particular air used for foaming milk, or for post-heating beverages already produced, where the temperature thereof is not satisfactory or the user needs to have it at a different temperature from that envisaged.</p>
<p id="p-0022" num="0021">Experimentation carried out by the Applicant lies, to a large extent, in the fact that electromagnetic-induction, continuous-flow fluid heaters are particularly advantageous in that they allow the fluid to be heated in a short time.</p>
<p id="p-0023" num="0022">Different fluid heaters in fluid foaming machines, in particular milk foaming machines, are disclosed in US 2018/193807 A1 and WO 2017/216015.</p>
<heading id="h-0005" level="1">SUMMARY OF THE DISCLOSURE</heading>
<p id="p-0024" num="0023">The above-described electromagnetic-induction, continuous-flow fluid heaters represent a functionally valid solution for heating fluids in general in automatic hot beverage preparation machines.</p>
<p id="p-0025" num="0024">However, the Applicant has ascertained that an efficient heating is subject to careful and daily cleaning of the duct in which the fluid is caused to flow and periodical replacement of some components of the filter, on the one hand, but that these cleaning/replacement operations are extremely difficult and require relatively long intervention times, on the other hand.</p>
<p id="p-0026" num="0025">This is due to the fact that known heaters, although openable or disassemblable to allow the path of the fluid flow to be accessed, are in fact housed inside a casing of the automatic beverage preparation machine in positions which are difficult to reach and such that the cleaning of the same heaters and/or the replacement thereof, when necessary, is subordinate to the disassembly of parts of the casing. Reverse operations are of course then necessary for the recommissioning after maintenance/replacement.</p>
<p id="p-0027" num="0026">In some cases, the disassembly of the casing is not immediate and easy because the casings, sometimes also for aesthetic reasons, consist of half-shells or parts, even of complex geometry, which are connected together by means of &#x201c;hidden&#x201d; screws or bolts and therefore not immediately accessible.</p>
<p id="p-0028" num="0027">In some cases, the maintenance of the heaters even requires the automatic beverage preparation machine to be tilted or completely overturned, forcing the maintenance technician to work in uncomfortable conditions, also to avoid the leakage of liquid following the opening of the heater or the decoupling of the heater from the hydraulic or pneumatic circuit inside the automatic beverage preparation machine.</p>
<p id="p-0029" num="0028">It is clear that such operations are both time-consuming and require relatively large support/maneuvering spaces, which are not normally available in the areas where automatic beverage preparation machines are located.</p>
<p id="p-0030" num="0029">The object of the present disclosure is to provide an automatic beverage preparation machine with electromagnetic-induction, continuous-flow fluid heaters, the design features of which allow to solve the above-mentioned problems in a simple and economical manner and, in particular, allow immediate access to the heater and permit an easy maintenance thereof.</p>
<p id="p-0031" num="0030">According to the present disclosure, an automatic beverage preparation machine with an electromagnetic-induction, continuous-flow fluid heater is provided, as claimed in claim <b>1</b>.</p>

<p id="p-0040" num="0039">With reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>1</b> and <b>2</b></figref>, reference numeral <b>1</b> denotes an automatic beverage preparation machine operable to prepare beverages in general, and hot beverages, in particular, starting from a fluid to be heated at a predefined temperature as a function of the type/temperature of the beverage to be prepared and of the chemical-physical and organoleptic features of the fluid to be heated.</p>
<p id="p-0041" num="0040">Hereinafter the term &#x201c;fluid&#x201d; is meant to indicate any liquid product or any liquid mixture, e.g., water or milk, or any heatable gaseous substance or mixture, e.g., air. Air or an equivalent gaseous mixture is used in brewing beverages, such as tea, coffee, etc., or to froth other substances such as natural or artificial liquid milk, etc.</p>
<p id="p-0042" num="0041">Still with reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>, the automatic beverage preparation machine <b>1</b> comprises a casing <b>2</b>, in turn, comprising a base wall <b>3</b>, an upper wall <b>4</b>, two side walls <b>5</b>, and a front wall <b>6</b> facing, in use, a user. The walls <b>3</b>-<b>6</b> are firmly mutually connected.</p>
<p id="p-0043" num="0042">In the example described, the casing <b>2</b> has a front recess <b>7</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref>) delimited, at the bottom, by a resting surface <b>8</b> for a cup <b>9</b>, into which the beverage is dispensed, and at the top by a wall <b>8</b>A (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref>) from which a beverage dispenser <b>10</b> protrudes to dispense a beverage in a cup <b>9</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0044" num="0043">With reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref>, the casing <b>2</b> houses a beverage preparation group <b>12</b> for preparing and dispensing beverages by heating fluids, in this case both liquids, for example water or milk, and aeriform, for example air or a mixture of gases.</p>
<p id="p-0045" num="0044">The beverage preparation group <b>12</b> comprises an fluid inlet circuit <b>13</b> to receive a fluid to be heated, a heating device <b>14</b> to heat the received fluid, and an fluid outlet circuit <b>15</b> where a heated fluid is supplied and having a fluid outlet connected to a fluid dispensing nozzle <b>10</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0046" num="0045">The heating device <b>14</b> is an electromagnetic-induction, continuous-flow fluid heater and has a fluid inlet <b>14</b>A connected to a fluid outlet of the fluid inlet circuit <b>13</b>, and a fluid outlet <b>14</b>B connected to the fluid outlet circuit <b>15</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0047" num="0046">The fluid inlet circuit <b>13</b> comprises a three-way selection valve <b>18</b>, which has an inlet port fluidly connected to a water supply duct <b>19</b>, an inlet port fluidly connected to a liquid supply duct <b>20</b> provided to supply a liquid different from water, for example milk or a cleaning liquid, and a fluid outlet <b>18</b>A where a selected liquid is supplied. The fluid inlet circuit <b>13</b> further comprises a proportional valve <b>21</b> operable to control inlet air, and a tubular T-joint <b>22</b> with inlets fluidly connected to outlets of the valves <b>18</b> and <b>21</b>, and an outlet fluidly connected to an inlet of the fluid outlet circuit <b>15</b> via a rotary pump <b>23</b> and a pressure sensor <b>24</b>, known per se and not described in detail.</p>
<p id="p-0048" num="0047">With reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref> and, in particular, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b></figref>, the heating device <b>14</b> comprises two heaters <b>25</b> and <b>26</b> housed in, and firmly coupled to, the casing <b>2</b> and arranged mutually in series in a direction of flow of the fluid supplied by the fluid inlet circuit <b>13</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0049" num="0048">Conveniently but not necessarily, each heater <b>25</b>, <b>26</b> is of the type described in the Italian patent application No. 102020000014692 filed on 19 Jun. 2020 in the name of the Applicant and which is referred herein and the disclosure of which is incorporated herein in its entirety in respect of the necessary parts.</p>
<p id="p-0050" num="0049">Conveniently, the two heaters <b>25</b> and <b>26</b> are constructively identical. Preferably, the two heaters <b>25</b> and <b>26</b> are arranged side by side, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>2</b> and <b>4</b></figref>, and are firmly coupled to the casing <b>2</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0051" num="0050">In a variant not illustrated, the two heaters <b>25</b> and <b>26</b> are stacked.</p>
<p id="p-0052" num="0051">In a variant, the two heaters <b>25</b> and <b>26</b> are constructively different.</p>
<p id="p-0053" num="0052">Preferably, the heaters <b>25</b>, <b>26</b> comprise respective tubular bodies <b>27</b> and <b>28</b> having respective longitudinal axes <b>27</b>A and <b>28</b>A. Conveniently, the axes <b>27</b>A and <b>28</b>A are mutually parallel and form an angle A with the resting plane <b>8</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref>).</p>
<p id="p-0054" num="0053">In the preferred, non-limiting embodiment described, the tubular bodies <b>27</b> and <b>28</b> are substantially cylindrical and both axes A are straight.</p>
<p id="p-0055" num="0054">Regardless of geometry, each tubular body <b>27</b>, <b>28</b> is made of an electrically and magnetically conducting material so as to be heatable by electromagnetic induction by means of an electromagnetic induction field.</p>
<p id="p-0056" num="0055">The heaters <b>25</b> and <b>26</b> further comprise respective electrical windings <b>29</b>, <b>30</b> which, in the example described, are wound around the respective tubular body <b>27</b>, <b>28</b> coaxially to the axis A, and are electrically powerable to generate an electromagnetic induction field.</p>
<p id="p-0057" num="0056">Conveniently, the electrical windings <b>29</b> and <b>30</b> are controlled independently. Conveniently, the winding <b>29</b> is controlled to heat the fluid to a temperature between 5&#xb0; and 40&#xb0; C.</p>
<p id="p-0058" num="0057">The winding <b>30</b> is instead controllable to raise the temperature of the fluid supplied by the heater <b>25</b> to a temperature for example of 70&#xb0; C.</p>
<p id="p-0059" num="0058">In a variant, the electrical windings <b>29</b> and <b>30</b> are electrically series-connected and controlled together.</p>
<p id="p-0060" num="0059">Again with reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref>, the heater <b>25</b> is fluidly connected to the outlet of the duct <b>13</b> by means of a fluidic connection device <b>31</b>. In the example described, the fluidic connection device <b>31</b> is of a plug type and comprises a fixed hollow collar <b>32</b>, inside which a lower end section of the tubular body <b>27</b> protrudes, and a closing plug <b>33</b> defining a fluid passage and fixed onto the collar by means of screws <b>34</b>, in order to define with the collar part of a fluid-tight chamber K, into which an end of the tubular body <b>27</b> opens.</p>
<p id="p-0061" num="0060">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b></figref>, the heater <b>26</b> is fluidly connected to an inlet of the fluid outlet duct <b>15</b> by means of a fluidic connection device <b>43</b> constructively identical to the fluidic connection device <b>31</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0062" num="0061">With reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>2</b> and <b>4</b></figref>, the heaters <b>25</b> and <b>26</b> are mutually connected by means of a fluidic connection assembly <b>35</b>, which comprises, a fluidic connection device <b>37</b> associated with the tubular body <b>27</b>, a fluidic connection device <b>38</b> associated with the tubular body <b>28</b>, and a piping <b>39</b> connecting the fluidic connection devices <b>37</b> and <b>38</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0063" num="0062">Conveniently, the fluidic connection devices <b>37</b> and <b>38</b> are constructively identical or similar to the device <b>31</b> and comprise respective collars <b>37</b>A and <b>38</b>A and respective plugs <b>37</b>B and <b>38</b>B, which define respective fluid passages and are fixed onto the respective collars <b>37</b>A and <b>37</b>B by means of screws <b>40</b> to delimit with the same collars part of respective fluid-tight chambers K, into which free ends of the tubular bodies <b>27</b>, <b>28</b> open and protrude (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>3</b>,<b>4</b> and <b>5</b></figref>).</p>
<p id="p-0064" num="0063">Conveniently, each plug <b>37</b>B, <b>38</b>B stably carries a longitudinal insert <b>41</b>, in jargon known as an &#x201c;auger&#x201d;, which extends inside the respective tubular body <b>27</b>, <b>28</b> and is configured to guide the fluid to be heated through a predefined curved or twisting path.</p>
<p id="p-0065" num="0064">In a variant not shown, the plugs <b>37</b>B and <b>38</b>B are deprived of the inserts <b>41</b>, and the fluid flows longitudinally through the tubular bodies <b>27</b>, <b>28</b> along the axes <b>27</b>A and <b>28</b>A.</p>
<p id="p-0066" num="0065">Again with reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>3</b>, <b>4</b> and <b>5</b></figref>, the fluidic connection assembly <b>35</b> extends outside a fixed side wall <b>46</b> of the casing <b>2</b>. The wall <b>46</b> is arranged adjacent to the upper wall <b>4</b>, above the recess <b>7</b> and the fluid dispensing nozzle <b>10</b>, and is provided with a pair of openings <b>45</b> which put the inside of the casing in communication with the outside.</p>
<p id="p-0067" num="0066">In the example described, the tubular bodies <b>27</b> and <b>28</b> extend inside the casing <b>2</b> from the wall <b>46</b>, while the collars <b>37</b>A and <b>38</b>A protrude from the wall <b>46</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0068" num="0067">In the example described, the collars <b>37</b>A and <b>38</b>A, and the corresponding plugs <b>37</b>B and <b>38</b>B and the piping <b>39</b>, are hence arranged completely outside the casing <b>2</b>. And they are housed inside a <b>47</b> chamber (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref>).</p>
<p id="p-0069" num="0068">The chamber <b>47</b> has a back wall defined by the side wall <b>46</b> and is closed by a shaped hatch <b>48</b>. Conveniently, the hatch <b>48</b> is hinged to the upper wall <b>4</b> to rotate about a hinge axis <b>49</b> between a closed position, in which is closes the chamber <b>47</b>, shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>, and an open position, shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0070" num="0069">During beverage dispensing, the hatch <b>48</b> is held in the closed position, thus isolating the fluidic connection assembly <b>35</b> from the outside. When, on the other hand, the heaters <b>25</b> and <b>26</b> have to be subjected to maintenance, the hatch <b>48</b> is moved to the open position, the screws <b>40</b> are removed, so releasing the plugs <b>37</b>B, <b>38</b>B and the collars from the casing <b>2</b>. At this point, decoupling or not the piping <b>39</b> from at least one of the plugs <b>37</b>B, <b>38</b>B, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b></figref>, the plugs <b>37</b>A and <b>38</b>A are extracted along with the associated inserts <b>41</b>, when provided, leaving the accesses to the inside of the tubular bodies <b>27</b> and <b>28</b> visible (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b></figref>).</p>
<p id="p-0071" num="0070">In these conditions it is easy for an operator assigned to cleaning operations to insert a pipe cleaner into the tubular bodies <b>27</b> and <b>28</b> and clean them. After cleaning, the plugs <b>37</b>B and <b>38</b>B are repositioned and screwed back on, the piping <b>39</b> is reconnected, the hatch <b>48</b> is closed and the automatic beverage preparation machine <b>1</b> is again ready for operation.</p>
<p id="p-0072" num="0071">It is clear from the foregoing that the possibility of accessing inside the tubular bodies <b>27</b>, <b>28</b> directly from the outside without having to dismantle parts of the casing <b>2</b> and keeping the automatic beverage preparation machine stationary in the same operating position greatly simplifies cleaning and maintenance operations, on the one hand, and considerably reduces intervention times, on the other. In particular, all the cleaning operations to remove the limescale are facilitated.</p>
<p id="p-0073" num="0072">In addition to this, maintenance does not require operating spaces other than that required for normal machine operation, and the environment around the automatic beverage preparation machine <b>1</b> is not polluted by leakage of liquids or other substances, which in some cases can occur even only if the machine is tilted.</p>
<p id="p-0074" num="0073">The special design and control of the heaters <b>25</b> and <b>26</b> allows precise and gradual control of the temperature of the fluid to be heated so as to avoid temperature fluctuations and thus ensure optimum treatment regardless of the fluid being treated and, in particular, in the presence of sensitive liquids.</p>
<p id="p-0075" num="0074">It is clear from the above that modifications and variations can be made to the automatic beverage preparation machine <b>1</b> described without going beyond the scope of protection defined by the independent claim.</p>
<p id="p-0076" num="0075">In particular, the fluidic connection devices <b>37</b> and <b>38</b> could be made differently than what is described. In particular, the plugs <b>37</b>B and <b>38</b>B and the associated collars <b>37</b>A and <b>38</b>A could be made in a manner other than that indicated by way of example, be mutually connected and to the casing <b>2</b> in a manner other than that indicated and, for example, by means of quick coupling and release devices, such as, for example, bayonet or snap-on devices.</p>
<p id="p-0077" num="0076">Not only that, the fluidic connection devices <b>37</b> and <b>38</b> could not be arranged completely outside the casing <b>2</b>, but extend at least partially inside the casing <b>2</b> through the openings <b>45</b> or even be arranged inside the casing <b>2</b> and the openings <b>45</b> be configured to allow access to the casing <b>2</b> and allow the removal of the plugs <b>37</b>B and <b>38</b>B from the outside so as to make the direct access from the outside to the tubular bodies <b>27</b>, <b>28</b> free without having to disassemble the casing.</p>
<p id="p-0078" num="0077">The openings <b>45</b> may not be separate but parts of a single opening.</p>
<p id="p-0079" num="0078">Similarly, and irrespective of the embodiment, the fluidic connection assembly <b>35</b> and the plugs <b>37</b>B and <b>38</b>B could be arranged in a different area of the casing <b>2</b> than that indicated by way of example with respect to the dispensing nozzle <b>10</b> and, for example, be arranged in outer recesses of the side walls <b>5</b> or even of a rear wall of the automatic beverage preparation machine <b>1</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0080" num="0079">In a preferred embodiment, the heaters <b>25</b> and <b>26</b> may be arranged in positions such that the fluidic connection device <b>43</b> is also accessible from the outside through an access opening formed through the casing <b>2</b>. Conveniently, the two access openings of the fluidic connection devices <b>31</b> and <b>43</b> are opposite and placed one above and one below the heaters <b>25</b> and <b>26</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0081" num="0080">Furthermore, chamber <b>47</b> could be closed by a hatch other than the one indicated as an example or even be an open chamber, in which case the hatch <b>48</b> could be absent.</p>
<p id="p-0082" num="0081">Finally, it is clear from the foregoing that the heating device <b>14</b> could comprise only one heater and, for example, only the heater <b>25</b>. In this case, the fluid outlet circuit <b>15</b> extends from the fluidic connection device <b>37</b>.</p>
