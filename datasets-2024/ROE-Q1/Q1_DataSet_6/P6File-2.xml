The work recipe <b>1300</b> is configured to define work processes of cultivation to be performed in accordance with a change of an elapsed time from the start of cultivation, a condition of the plant cultivation device, a condition of the plant cultivation system <b>800</b>, the environmental value data <b>1230</b> of the basic recipe <b>1200</b> (that is, a change in the environment), or the like.</p>
<p id="p-0130" num="0129">The process control performed by the work recipe <b>1300</b> is managed based on an absolute time from a particular point in time such as sowing.

As a result, when the cultivation environment is changed and the environmental value data <b>1230</b> of the basic recipe <b>1200</b> is changed, the process management may be performed at the time of changing the growing environment, by referring to the work recipe <b>1300</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0131" num="0130">As for the work processes, for example, sowing, transplanting from <b>150</b> strains to <b>32</b> strains, transplanting from <b>32</b> strains to <b>12</b> strains, harvesting, trimming, packaging, storing, transporting and the like may be included. Here, a &#x201c;process&#x201d; as used herein means a progress of a series of activities which are consisted of growing of species of raw material, harvesting the plant, packing the plant, and shipping the plant as a product.</p>
<p id="p-0132" num="0131">The work environment <b>1310</b> defines the constraint condition for the work environment to be satisfied in executing the work process, for each of the work processes. For example, for the work process of the &#x201c;sowing&#x201d;, hours worked are defined as 300 seconds as the restriction condition. Also, as for a temperature, an allowable fluctuation range of a temperature is set to plus or minus 5 degrees from a reference temperature value of 25 degrees which is defined at 0 hours of elapsed time (at a timing of sowing) of the basic recipe <b>1200</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0133" num="0132">Similarly, other allowable fluctuation ranges during the work process of sowing are defined, for example, a fluctuation range of a humidity is set to plus or minus 10% from a reference value of the basic recipe <b>1200</b>, and a fluctuation range of a carbon dioxide concentration is set to from 400 ppm to 1000 ppm.</p>
<p id="p-0134" num="0133">Also, in the work constraint condition <b>1320</b>, items which are required to be controlled for performing the work are also defined, apart from the work environment. For example, when the work is not automated, precautions or the like for working are specified for workers.</p>
<p id="p-0135" num="0134">For example, the number of cultivations for each work process and a designation of a used stage and its position in the device for cultivating a plant are defined as the shelving logic.</p>
<p id="p-0136" num="0135">In addition, at a time of reproducing a cultivation environment in the cultivation device <b>1</b>A by the basic recipe <b>1200</b>, there may be a case where a control method differs depending on the device. The control logic for each device defines the control content specific to each device. For example, in order to set the environmental temperature to 20 degrees, the set temperature of the air conditioner in a device X is set to 20 degrees. In addition, the set temperature is set to A+1 degrees for a device Y. Further, in a case that the air conditioner is not provided in a device Z, a different control content such as controlling the set temperature to 20 degrees by using a cold water and a hot water is defined for the device Z,</p>
<p id="p-0137" num="0136">In the work constraint condition <b>1320</b>, the work step (s) (single process) to be performed at each work process is defined.

<p id="p-0138" num="0137">Alternatively, the process controlling module <b>913</b> displays each work step to be performed as the work process on the output device <b>905</b> such as a monitor, etc., or on the external work terminal <b>830</b>, etc., according to the work recipe <b>1300</b> for managing or controlling a work of a worker.</p>
<p id="p-0139" num="0138">For example, the following may correspond to one of the work steps: preparing a tool such as a tray for sowing, sowing of seeds by a worker, installing the sowed tray in an automated machine, moving the tray to a predetermined position by the automated machine, and growing a plant in an environment-controlled device or the like.</p>
<p id="p-0140" num="0139">In a case where a work of a worker is monitored, a progress of a work step is managed by reading a bar code or a RFID tag which is connected to the work terminal <b>830</b> or the management terminal <b>810</b> by the worker at a timing at which each work step is performed.</p>
<p id="p-0141" num="0140">In addition, by reading a bar code attached to a name tag or the like of the worker by using a bar code reader, information of the worker who performs the work may also be managed.</p>
<p id="p-0142" num="0141">In this way, the entire work process is able to be managed and controlled by appropriately acquiring and managing at least one of information about the worker, the work content, and the work target for each work step (single process) to be performed in each work process in the work constraint condition <b>1320</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0143" num="0142">For the proper illustration of this, a process of transplantation from <b>150</b> strains to <b>32</b> strains (primary transplantation) will be described.</p>

Based on the basic recipe <b>1200</b> downloaded from the management server <b>820</b>, the cultivation environment such as light, air, water, or space relating to a plant to be cultivated in an open type shelf or the like is controlled and managed. Although not perfect, compared to the closed or semi-closed type cultivation device, it is possible to sufficiently control and manage the cultivation environment even in the open type cultivation device.</p>
<p id="p-0164" num="0181"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>16</b></figref> depicts an example of the processing flow <b>1600</b> for controlling the process.</p>
<p id="p-0165" num="0182">The process control processing flow <b>1600</b> is started in response to a change in the value of the environmental value data <b>1230</b> of the basic recipe <b>1200</b>. Alternatively, it may be controlled based on the absolute time from a specific point in time, for example, at a time of sowing, etc., so as to be started when a predetermined time is reached.</p>
<p id="p-0166" num="0183">The process controlling module <b>913</b> of the management server <b>820</b> reads the work recipe <b>1300</b> which is stored in the work recipe DB <b>922</b> (step <b>1610</b>).</p>
<p id="p-0167" num="0184">The process controlling module <b>913</b> confirms the start of the work for the work process defined in the work recipe <b>1300</b> (step <b>1620</b>). For example, each of the work steps of the work process defined in the work recipe <b>1300</b> is displayed on a monitor or a screen of the work terminal <b>830</b> so that the worker is allowed to confirm the work content and tap a start button of the work.</p>
<p id="p-0168" num="0185">Alternatively, by using the bar code reader, the camera, or the RFID reader connected to the work terminal <b>830</b>, the start of the work may be confirmed by reading the information, the bar code, or the RFID tag, etc. for indicating the start of the work,</p>
<p id="p-0169" num="0186">Further, during the process in which the transplantation is performed, the start of the work may be confirmed by sensing an opening of the door of the cultivation device <b>1</b>A for outputting the cultivation tray.</p>
<p id="p-0170" num="0187">The process controlling module <b>913</b> acquires information for confirming each of the work steps of the work process defined in the work recipe <b>1300</b> and related information (step <b>1630</b>).</p>
<p id="p-0171" num="0188">According to the acquired work step, the worker, the robotic manipulator or the conveyor, etc., of the cultivation device <b>1</b>A is allowed to perform each work step of the work process.</p>
<p id="p-0172" num="0189">In a case where the worker performs the work step manually, it is possible to manage the progress of the work step by providing check items for each work step, and by acquiring confirmation data in response to input from the bar code reader, the RFID reader, or the worker for each check item.</p>
<p id="p-0173" num="0190">The process controlling module <b>913</b> acquires various data relating to the environment or the like from a plurality of sensors such as the temperature sensor, the humidity sensor, the carbon dioxide concentration sensor and the like which are provided at the place of work in the cultivation device <b>1</b>A and/or the outside of the cultivation device <b>1</b>A (step <b>1640</b>).</p>
<p id="p-0174" num="0191">Then, the data of the environment or the like obtained from the sensors are determined whether these are within a scope of the constraint condition (that is, a scope of the work environment <b>1310</b> and the work constraint condition <b>1320</b>) defined in the work recipe <b>1300</b> (step <b>1650</b>).</p>
<p id="p-0175" num="0192">In a case that the data are within the scope of the constraint condition (Yes in step <b>1650</b>), each work step is performed as it is, and it is repeated until the end of the work (No in step <b>1680</b>).</p>
<p id="p-0176" num="0193">Alternatively, in a case that the data is outside the scope of the constraint condition (No in step <b>1650</b>), an alert may be displayed (step <b>1670</b>).</p>
<p id="p-0177" num="0194">In the work environment <b>1310</b>, the constraint condition for the work environment is defined, which is supposed to be satisfied for performing the work process. For example, for the work process of the &#x201c;sowing&#x201d;, as the constraint condition, the working hours are defined as 300 seconds. Also, as for the temperature, a range of variation of the allowable temperature is set to plus or minus 5 degrees from a reference temperature value of 25 degrees at the elapsed time of 0 hours (at a time of sowing) defined in the basic recipe <b>1200</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0178" num="0195">The temperature in the closed or semi-closed cultivation device <b>1</b>A is controlled to be 25 degrees Celsius according to the basic recipe <b>1200</b>. In a case where the sowing is performed outside the cultivation device <b>1</b>A, there may be a case that the temperature at the work place of the sowing is out of a range of 25 degrees plus or minus 5 degrees (i.e. out of a range from 20 to 30 degrees). In such a case, an alert may be notified.</p>
<p id="p-0179" num="0196">Also, in a case where the hours worked exceed 300 seconds which are set as the constraint condition, an alert may be notified.</p>
<p id="p-0180" num="0197">In this way, the cultivation device <b>1</b>A of the embodiment is configured to seal the inside of the cultivation device <b>1</b>A for cultivating plant from the outside, and the basic recipe <b>1200</b> defines the environmental value data in the cultivation device <b>1</b>A. In addition, the work recipe <b>1300</b> defines the environmental value data to be satisfied when a plant to be cultivated is outputted to the outside from the cultivation device <b>1</b>A.</p>
<p id="p-0181" num="0198"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>17</b></figref> depicts an example of the processing flow <b>1700</b> for monitoring a growing condition.</p>
<p id="p-0182" num="0199">Firstly, the growing condition monitoring module <b>914</b> of the management server <b>820</b> reads the basic recipe <b>1200</b> stored in the basic recipe DB <b>921</b> (step <b>1710</b>).</p>
<p id="p-0183" num="0200">Then, the growing condition monitoring module <b>914</b> acquires various data from a plurality of sensors which are arranged inside and/or outside the cultivation device <b>1</b>A (step <b>1720</b>).</p>
<p id="p-0184" num="0201">The growing condition monitoring module <b>914</b> monitors and displays the growing condition of the plant to be cultivated according to the information acquired from the various sensors (step <b>1730</b>). For example, a photosynthesis rate, an evaporation rate, a water absorption rate, an area of leaves, a height of leaves, a number of leaves, a weight of strains, an abnormal growth, a number of bacteria, or the like associated with the plant to be cultivated may be monitored.</p>
<p id="p-0185" num="0202">The growing condition monitoring module <b>914</b> displays an assumed growing condition when the plant is assumed to be cultivated according to the environmental value data <b>1230</b> defined in the basic recipe <b>1200</b>, and also an actual growing condition which is obtained from a plurality of sensors. The assumed growing condition and the actual growing condition are displayed in such a manner that the conditions can be compared. The assumed growing condition is specified in the index value alert data <b>1240</b>. For example, as the index value alert data <b>1240</b>, information such as a photosynthesis rate, an evaporation rate, a water absorption rate, an area of leaves, a height of leaves, a number of leaves, a weight of strains, an abnormal growth, a number of bacteria, or the like associated with the plant to be cultivated may be defined.</p>
<p id="p-0186" num="0203">The growing condition monitoring module <b>914</b> determines whether the actual growing condition is within a predetermined range from the assumed growing condition (step <b>1740</b>). When the actual growing condition is out of a predetermined range or more from the assumed growing condition (for example, when the actual growing condition is deviated by 5% or more), an alert may be displayed (step <b>1750</b>).</p>
<p id="p-0187" num="0204">In addition, when the actual growing condition deviates from the assumed growing condition by a predetermined range or more, the growing condition monitoring module <b>914</b> may change the basic recipe <b>1200</b> which is applied to the cultivation device <b>1</b>A, in cooperation with the environment controlling module <b>912</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0188" num="0205">The growing condition monitoring module <b>914</b> repeats the process for monitoring the growing condition until an end indication of the monitoring is made (step <b>1760</b>).</p>
<p id="p-0189" num="0206"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>18</b></figref> depicts an example of a display screen of the monitored growing condition.</p>
<p id="p-0190" num="0207">The growing condition monitoring module <b>914</b> displays the actual growing condition of the plant which is acquired from a plurality of sensors, on a monitor such as the output device <b>905</b> of the management terminal <b>810</b> or on a screen of the work terminal <b>830</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0191" num="0208">As the items to be displayed, information such as a photosynthesis rate, an evaporation rate, a water absorption rate, an area of leaves, a height of leaves, a number of leaves, a weight of strains, an abnormal growth, a number of bacteria, or the like described in the index value alert data <b>1240</b> of the basic recipe <b>1200</b> may be tracked and displayed. In the example illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>18</b></figref>, a rate of increase in weight is shown by measuring the strain weight of the plant to be cultivated.</p>
<p id="p-0192" num="0209">The portion indicated by the broken line corresponds to the assumed growing condition <b>1810</b> when the plant is assumed to be cultivated according to the environmental value data <b>1230</b>. Also, the portion indicated by the solid line corresponds to the actual growing condition <b>1820</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0193" num="0210">In this way, the growing condition monitoring module <b>914</b> is able to display the assumed growing condition and the actual growing condition in such a manner that the conditions can be compared.</p>
<p id="p-0194" num="0211">The parts shown by the reference numbers <b>1830</b> and <b>1840</b> correspond to parts where transplantations have been performed. It can be seen that, in the case of making the transplantation, taking out the plant from the closed or semi-closed cultivation device <b>1</b>A may change the cultivation environment even if it is performed in a short time, resulting in a significant delay in the growth rate of the plant.</p>
<p id="p-0195" num="0212">The growing condition monitoring module <b>914</b> may display an alert when a deviation of a predetermined value (for example, 5% or more) occurs between the assumed growing condition <b>1810</b> such as <b>1830</b> or <b>1840</b> and the actual growing condition <b>1820</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0196" num="0213">Or, it is possible to change the work recipe <b>1300</b> to be applied. For example, it may be changed to the environmental value data <b>1230</b> for promoting the delayed growth.</p>
<p id="p-0197" num="0214">The cultivation device <b>1</b>A of the embodiment is configured as the closed or semi-closed type cultivation device. Therefore, by making different the inside from the normal outside air environment, for example, by setting a photon flux density higher than normal, by setting a cultivation temperature higher than normal, and/or by setting a carbon dioxide concentration higher than a working environment for a person, it becomes possible to set the environment for cultivating a plant with high productivity compared to a plant cultivation method with a conventional plant factory. In the work process, a significant delay may be caused in the cultivation of the plant by taking out the plant from such a special cultivation environment to perform the work process such as the transplantation under the normal outside air environment.</p>
<p id="p-0198" num="0215">Hence, according to the embodiment, the constraint condition such as the work environment <b>1310</b> and/or the work constraint condition <b>1320</b> or the like may be set even for the work process which can be conducted outside the cultivation device <b>1</b>A in order to maintain the work environment within a certain environmental quality not to be deviated largely from the inside of the cultivation device <b>1</b>A. As a result, by performing the environmental control and the process control of the whole plant cultivation process, it becomes possible to enhance the speed and the quality for cultivating the plant.</p>
<heading id="h-0009" level="1">Third Embodiment</heading>
<p id="p-0199" num="0216">In the third embodiment, the cultivation device <b>1</b>A is arranged in a closed or semi-closed cultivation facility <b>1</b>. In this configuration, an external environment of the cultivation device <b>1</b>A is managed together.</p>
<p id="p-0200" num="0217"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>19</b></figref> depicts an example of the cultivation facility for controlling both the inside and the outside of the cultivation device <b>1</b>A.</p>
<p id="p-0201" num="0218">The cultivation facility <b>1</b> is configured as a structure capable of sealing or semi-sealing the inside from the outside of the facility. The cultivation facility <b>1</b> is provided with the cultivation device <b>1</b>A which is described in the first embodiment and/or the second embodiment inside. The cultivation facility <b>1</b> is configured to manage light, air, water, and space outside the cultivation device <b>1</b>A.</p>
<p id="p-0202" num="0219">The cultivation facility <b>1</b> constitutes a part of the plant cultivation system <b>800</b>, and is connected to the management terminal <b>810</b>, the management server <b>820</b>, the work terminal <b>830</b>, and the cultivation device <b>1</b>A via a network.</p>
<p id="p-0203" num="0220">The cultivation facility <b>1</b> includes a plurality of sensors <b>1901</b> for monitoring various conditions such as light, air, water, and space. In addition, the cultivation facility <b>1</b> includes an air circulation device <b>1903</b> and an artificial light source <b>1902</b> or the like for controlling the external environment outside the cultivation device <b>1</b>A. The external environment may have various conditions such as light, air, water, and space.</p>
<p id="p-0204" num="0221">The air circulation device <b>1903</b> has a function similar to that of the air circulation device <b>30</b> provided in the cultivation device <b>1</b>A, that is, a function of adjusting at least a temperature, a humidity, a carbon dioxide concentration, and flow rate (or an amount of flow) of air.</p>
<p id="p-0205" num="0222">The artificial light source <b>1902</b> has a function similar to that of the artificial light source <b>230</b> provided in the cultivation device <b>1</b>A, that is, a function of dimming with light of any brightness and/or wavelength.</p>
<p id="p-0206" num="0223">The cultivation facility <b>1</b> is configured to adjust and manage an environment in the cultivation facility <b>1</b> (and outside the cultivation device <b>1</b>A) such as light, air, water, and space according to the basic recipe <b>1200</b> described in the second embodiment. The basic recipe <b>1200</b> sent from the management server <b>820</b> is received by the management terminal <b>810</b> and the basic recipe <b>1200</b> is stored in the basic recipe DB <b>921</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0207" num="0224">The environment controlling module <b>912</b> of the management terminal <b>810</b> reads the basic recipe <b>1200</b> stored in the basic recipe DB <b>921</b>. Then, the environment controlling module <b>912</b> controls the air circulation device, the artificial light source, the robot manipulator, the conveyor or the like in the cultivation facility <b>1</b> according to the read information in order to control a light wavelength, a photon flux density, a temperature, a humidity, a carbon dioxide concentration, various ion concentrations, a horizontal air flow rate, an air flow rate from above, or the like in the cultivation facility <b>1</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0208" num="0225">It is possible to use the management server <b>820</b> instead of the management terminal <b>810</b> in order to operates the cultivation facility <b>1</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0209" num="0226">In this way, it is possible to control various environments such as light, air, water and space inside of the cultivation device <b>1</b>A and those inside the cultivation facility <b>1</b> (that is, outside the cultivation device <b>1</b>A) according to the basic recipe <b>1200</b> received from the management server <b>820</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0210" num="0227">The basic recipe <b>1200</b> applied to the cultivation device <b>1</b>A defines a constraint condition as an acceptable variation range from the environment in the cultivation device which is controlled according to the environmental value data <b>1230</b>. In addition, the basic recipe <b>1200</b> applied to the cultivation facility <b>1</b> defines a constraint condition as an acceptable variation range from the environment in the cultivation facility <b>1</b> (that is, outside the cultivation device) which is controlled according to the environmental value data <b>1230</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0211" num="0228">In the inside and outside of the cultivation device <b>1</b>A, the environment may be changed due to a growth and movement of a plant to be cultivated and also operations for cultivating a plant, etc. The environment is managed in order to satisfy the constraint condition.</p>
<p id="p-0212" num="0229">The environment controlling module <b>912</b> is able to detect that the environment exceeds the allowable variation range of the environment value which is determined as the constraint condition inside or outside of the cultivation device <b>1</b>A, based on information received from various sensors. In such a case, the environment controlling module <b>912</b> may output an alert to the management terminal <b>810</b> and/or the management server <b>820</b>. In addition, the environment controlling module <b>912</b> may control the air circulation device, the nourishing solution circulation device <b>40</b>, the artificial light source, the robot manipulator, the conveyor or the like in order to adjust the environment of the inside or outside of the cultivation device <b>1</b>A. As a result, it becomes possible to bring the environment within the constraint condition.</p>
<p id="p-0213" num="0230">Next, the environmental value data <b>1230</b> to be set to the inside part and outside part of the cultivation device <b>1</b>A will be described.</p>
<p id="p-0214" num="0231">Basically, a person who performs a work (that is, worker) will not enter in the closed or semi-closed type cultivation device <b>1</b>A. Therefore, the environment in the plant cultivation device managed by the basic recipe is set to correspond to a plant to be cultivated.</p>
<p id="p-0215" num="0232">However, in a case of the inside of the cultivation facility <b>1</b> and the outside of the cultivation device <b>1</b>A, there is a possibility that a worker stays there to perform a work for a plant to be cultivated. In such a case, the environment outside the plant cultivation device managed by the basic recipe is set to correspond to a person who performs a work.</p>
<p id="p-0216" num="0233">It is possible to set the environment in the cultivation device <b>1</b>A out of the scope permitted to a person who performs a work. For example, the outside of the cultivation device <b>1</b>A may be set to an environment in which a carbon dioxide concentration is set not higher than 1000 ppm which is defined by the standards of the environmental hygiene management for the air environment. In addition, the inside of the cultivation device <b>1</b>A is set to an environment in which a carbon dioxide concentration is set higher than this standard value. As a result, it becomes possible to acquire an environment for cultivating a plant with higher productivity than ever, comparing to a case in which a plant is cultivated with a conventional plant factory.</p>
<p id="p-0217" num="0234">When a work process is performed according to the second embodiment, there is a possibility that a plant to be cultivated is outputted from the cultivation device <b>1</b>A. In such a case, the plant to be cultivated may be placed in the environment that is largely different from the environment in the cultivation device <b>1</b>A even if the period is short.</p>
<p id="p-0218" num="0235">As described with reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>18</b></figref>, the change in the cultivation environment even in a short period of time may result in a significant delay in the growth rate of the plant.</p>
<p id="p-0219" num="0236">Therefore, in the present embodiment, the environment outside the cultivation device <b>1</b>A is managed together, so that the variation of the cultivation environment for the plant is suppressed as much as possible to maintain the growth rate.</p>
<p id="p-0220" num="0237">For example, when there is no worker in the environment outside the cultivation device <b>1</b>A, the environment is determined only by the appropriate environment value for the plant to be cultivated. Specifically, the environment is set equivalent to or close to the inside of the cultivation device <b>1</b>A.</p>
<p id="p-0221" num="0238">Or, in a case that the plant to be cultivated does not exist outside the cultivation device <b>1</b>A, the environment is determined only by the appropriate environment value for a worker. For example, the environment is set to be suitable for a worker, such as within a range of content ratio of carbon dioxide of 1000 ppm or below, a temperature range from 17 degrees or more to 28 degrees or below, and a relative humidity range from 40% or more to 70% or below, etc.</p>
<p id="p-0222" num="0239">In addition, in a case that a worker coexists with a plant to be cultivated, the value may be set to a value between an optimal value of the environment for the plant to be cultivated and an optimal value of the environment for the worker. In other words, the environment in the cultivation facility <b>1</b> (and the environment outside the cultivation device <b>1</b>A) is set according to an environmental value data which is calculated from both the basic recipe for defining the environment inside the cultivation device <b>1</b>A and the basic recipe of the cultivation facility <b>1</b> for defining the environment outside the cultivation device <b>1</b>A.</p>
<p id="p-0223" num="0240">For example, the environment outside the cultivation device <b>1</b>A is set according to the constraint condition of the basic recipe for the cultivation device <b>1</b>A and the constraint condition of the basic recipe for the cultivation facility <b>1</b>. Specifically, the environmental setting value is calculated for minimizing a sum of a deviation from the environmental allowable range for the plant to be cultivated defined by the basic recipe for the cultivation device <b>1</b>A to the set environmental value and a deviation from the environmental allowable range for the worker defined by the basic recipe for the cultivation facility <b>1</b> to the set environmental value.</p>
<p id="p-0224" num="0241">Here, it is thought that a plurality of items or values may coexist in the appropriate values of the environment for the plant to be cultivated.</p>
<p id="p-0225" num="0242">In addition, it is conceivable to adapt a method to add a significance factor to the plant to be calculated and/or the worker and to calculate the environmental setting value so as to minimize a sum of the above-mentioned deviation and the significance.</p>
