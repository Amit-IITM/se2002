<heading id="h-0003" level="1">1. Technical Field</heading>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">This document relates to devices and methods for performing transoral surgery. For example, this document relates to oral retractor devices and articulating surgical tools that are well-suited for transoral surgery uses.</p>
<heading id="h-0004" level="1">2. Background Information</heading>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">Transoral robotic surgery (TORS) has become one of the leading surgical techniques for management of oropharyngeal malignancy. This technique has also been applied to laryngeal and hypo-pharyngeal pathology, as well sleep medicine surgery. Since the inception of TORS, there has been little advancement in field regarding techniques, exposure, and instrumentation.</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">TORS is traditionally performed in the supine position with oral retractors that push on the tongue to enable clinicians to view the upper aerodigestive tract through a straight &#x201c;line-of-sight&#x201d; approach. However, in some cases this can significantly compress the base of tongue, larynx, and hypopharynx, rendering visualization and making access difficult, and sometimes impractical.</p>
<heading id="h-0005" level="1">SUMMARY</heading>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">This document provides devices and methods for performing transoral surgery. For example, this document provides oral retractor devices and articulating surgical tools that are well-suited for oral surgery uses.</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">In one implementation, an oral retractor device includes a first maxillary trough configured for engagement with a maxilla of a patient, a first mandibular trough configured for engagement with a mandible of the patient, and a mechanism coupled between the first maxillary trough and the first mandibular trough. The mechanism is actuatable to increase and decrease a separation distance between the first maxillary trough and the first mandibular trough. The first mandibular trough is positionally adjustable in relation to the mechanism and to the first maxillary trough.</p>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">Such an oral retractor device may optionally include one or more of the following features. The mechanism may include two arms configured in a scissors arrangement with a pivot joint. The mechanism may include a retention mechanism for releasably latching the two arms in a fixed relative orientation so that the first maxillary trough and the first mandibular trough are separated in a particular fixed separation distance. The mechanism may include an adjust mechanism for positionally adjusting the first mandibular trough in relation to the mechanism and to the first maxillary trough. The oral retraction device may also include a second maxillary trough configured for engagement with the maxilla of a patient and a second mandibular trough configured for engagement with the mandible of the patient. The first maxillary trough and the second maxillary trough may be coupled together by a maxillary arched member. The first mandibular member and the second mandibular member may be coupled together by a mandibular arched member. The mandibular arched member may including an attachment feature for fixating a tongue to the oral retraction device.</p>
<p id="p-0009" num="0008">In another implementation, an oral retraction system includes an oral retraction device, a maxillary dental protector configured to couple between the maxilla and the first maxillary trough, and a mandibular dental protector configured to couple between the mandible and the first mandibular trough. The oral retraction device may include a first maxillary trough configured for engagement with a maxilla of a patient, a first mandibular trough configured for engagement with a mandible of the patient, and a mechanism coupled between the first maxillary trough and the first mandibular trough. The mechanism is actuatable to increase and decrease a separation distance between the first maxillary trough and the first mandibular trough. The first mandibular trough is positionally adjustable in relation to the mechanism and to the first maxillary trough.</p>

<heading id="h-0007" level="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION</heading>
<p id="p-0026" num="0025">This document provides devices and methods for performing transoral surgery. For example, this document provides oral retractor devices and articulating surgical tools that are well-suited for oral surgery uses. The devices and methods provided herein may be used to treat conditions such as, but not limited to, mouth cancer, throat cancer, tongue cancer, larynx cancer, tonsil cancer, obstructive sleep disorders, and pharyngeal diverticulum, to provide some examples.</p>
<p id="p-0027" num="0026">In some cases, the devices and methods provided herein can be used for transoral robotic surgery (TORS). TORS is a procedure to remove oral cancers, for example, in which a surgeon uses a sophisticated, computer-enhanced system to guide the surgical tools. TORS gives the surgeon an enhanced view of the cancer and surrounding tissue. Using a robotic system to guide the surgical tools allows for more-precise movements in tiny spaces and the capability to work around corners. When compared with more-traditional procedures, TORS for oropharyngeal, laryngeal and hypo-pharyngeal cancer can tend to result in a quicker recovery and fewer complications.</p>
<p id="p-0028" num="0027">In some cases, the devices and methods provided herein can be used for seated TORS procedures. That is, in some cases rather than performing TORS on a patient in the supine position, TORS can be performed on the patient can be in a seated position. In addition, transoral surgery (TOS) in the seated position can also be accomplished with endoscopes and hand held instrumentation, without robotic assistance. The devices and methods provided herein can be used each of these techniques.</p>
<p id="p-0029" num="0028">This disclosure provides devices and methods such as a new oral retractor device that can expose the operative field without compression of the patient's tongue. New oral retracting instruments that can be hand held, fixed, or used with the robotic arm (for TORS) to assist retracting the tongue in a more surgically ergonomic position as also provided. The oral retractor devices provided herein pulls the tongue forward. In addition, new instruments that can be used for surgical access (e.g., in the seated position and other positions) such as angled/adjustable clip appliers, angled/adjustable bipolar cautery, angled/adjustable dissectors, and the like, are also provided herein. The instruments are configured to curve in correspondence with the curve at the back of the mouth and pharynx and adjust to accommodate individual patient and tumor anatomy.</p>
<p id="p-0030" num="0029">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>, an example oral retractor device <b>100</b> can be used to retract the mouth of a patient in an open position in preparation for transoral surgery. Oral retractor device <b>100</b> is configured to provide advantageous exposure and visualization of the complex anatomy of the back of the mouth and of the upper aerodigestive tract. That is accomplished, for example, because oral retractor device <b>100</b> allows the patient's mandible <b>12</b> to be distracted in a cranial-caudal (open/close) direction, as well as in a protracted anterior-posterior (jaw forward/back) position in relation to the patient's maxilla <b>14</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0031" num="0030">In some embodiments, the tongue <b>16</b> can be pulled anteriorly by a tongue stitch <b>180</b>. In some cases, tongue stitch <b>180</b> can be intermittently secured to an attachment member <b>156</b> on the anterior/inferior arch of oral retractor device <b>100</b> to maximize exposure without locking it into any single position. This would allow both the surgeon and surgical assistant to manipulate tongue <b>16</b> to gain better visibility and access throughout the case.</p>
<p id="p-0032" num="0031">In the depicted embodiment, oral retractor device <b>100</b> includes an actuation portion <b>110</b> and a retraction portion <b>140</b>. Actuation portion <b>110</b> and retraction portion <b>140</b> are coupled at a pivot joint <b>120</b>. Hence, actuation portion <b>110</b> and retraction portion <b>140</b> expand and retract inversely to each other.</p>
<p id="p-0033" num="0032">Actuation portion <b>110</b> includes a first handle <b>112</b><i>a </i>and a second handle <b>112</b><i>b</i>. First handle <b>112</b><i>a </i>is connected to a first arm <b>114</b><i>a</i>. Second handle <b>112</b><i>b </i>is connected to a second arm <b>114</b><i>b</i>. Arms <b>114</b><i>a </i>and <b>114</b><i>b </i>cross at a pivot joint <b>120</b> (like a scissors). Therefore, as actuation portion <b>110</b> is compressed to a smaller configuration (i.e., as handles <b>112</b><i>a </i>and <b>112</b><i>b </i>are moved closer to each other), retraction portion <b>140</b> becomes correspondingly enlarged. Conversely, as actuation portion <b>110</b> is enlarged (i.e., as handles <b>112</b><i>a </i>and <b>112</b><i>b </i>are moved farther from each other), retraction portion <b>140</b> transforms to a correspondingly smaller configuration. Therefore, to retract (separate) mandible <b>12</b> in an open position in relation to maxilla <b>14</b>, a clinician can compress handles <b>112</b><i>a </i>and <b>112</b><i>b </i>towards each other.</p>
<p id="p-0034" num="0033">Actuation portion <b>110</b> also includes a retention mechanism <b>114</b>. Retention mechanism <b>114</b> is releasably latchable. That is, as handles <b>112</b><i>a </i>and <b>112</b><i>b </i>are compressed towards each other, retention mechanism <b>114</b> can be biased to releasably latch first handle <b>112</b><i>a </i>in a fixed position in relation to second handle <b>112</b><i>b</i>. Accordingly, the retraction forces applied by retraction portion <b>140</b> to mandible <b>12</b> and maxilla <b>14</b> are maintained. In that fashion, the patient's mouth can be maintained retracted in an open position. The retraction forces can also be selectively released by deactivating (e.g., unlatching) retention mechanism <b>114</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0035" num="0034">In some embodiments, retention mechanism <b>114</b> also includes a numeric scale <b>116</b>. Numeric scale <b>116</b> can provide a quantitative indication of the extent of retraction between mandible <b>12</b> and maxilla <b>14</b>. In some embodiments, a force sensor is included that provides the clinician with an indication of the retraction force applied by retraction portion <b>140</b> onto the patient's mandible <b>12</b> and maxilla <b>14</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0036" num="0035">Retraction portion <b>140</b> includes arms <b>114</b><i>a </i>and <b>114</b><i>b</i>. Arms <b>114</b><i>a </i>and <b>114</b><i>b </i>extend from pivot joint <b>120</b> to a maxillary joint <b>122</b><i>a </i>and a mandibular joint <b>122</b><i>b</i>. In some embodiments, maxillary joint <b>122</b><i>a </i>and/or mandibular joint <b>122</b><i>b </i>are pivoting joints or hinged junctions. In some embodiments, a maxillary arch member <b>116</b><i>a </i>extends from maxillary joint <b>122</b><i>a</i>, and/or a mandibular arch member <b>116</b><i>b </i>extends from mandibular joint <b>122</b><i>b. </i></p>
<p id="p-0037" num="0036">A maxillary trough <b>150</b><i>a </i>is pivotably coupled to maxillary joint <b>122</b><i>a</i>. A mandibular trough <b>150</b><i>b </i>is pivotably coupled to mandibular joint <b>112</b><i>b</i>. Troughs <b>150</b><i>a </i>and <b>150</b><i>b </i>releasably couple with the patient's teeth or jaw bones. For example, in some cases troughs <b>150</b><i>a </i>and <b>150</b><i>b </i>releasably couple with the maxillary and mandible molars. In some embodiments, troughs <b>150</b><i>a </i>and <b>150</b><i>b </i>can be relocated to other positions on arch member <b>116</b><i>a </i>and <b>116</b><i>b </i>respectively.</p>
<p id="p-0038" num="0037">In some cases, a maxillary dental protector <b>190</b><i>a </i>and a mandibular dental protector <b>190</b><i>b </i>are used between troughs <b>150</b><i>a </i>and <b>150</b><i>b </i>and the patient's maxillary and mandibular dentition respectively. Dental protectors <b>190</b><i>a </i>and <b>190</b><i>b </i>protect the teeth and tongue <b>16</b>, and can prevent or inhibit slipping of the retractor troughs <b>150</b><i>a </i>and <b>150</b><i>b </i>in relation to the teeth in some embodiments.</p>
<p id="p-0039" num="0038">In some embodiments, dental protectors <b>190</b><i>a </i>and <b>190</b><i>b </i>can be compliant members similar to mouth guards (i.e., worn on the teeth). Mandibular trough <b>150</b><i>b </i>releasably couples with mandibular dental protector <b>190</b><i>b </i>(such that mandibular distraction can be actuated by mandibular trough <b>150</b><i>b</i>, as described further below). In some cases, dental protectors <b>190</b><i>a </i>and <b>190</b><i>b </i>are inserts that are attachable to troughs <b>150</b><i>a </i>and <b>150</b><i>b</i>. Such inserts can be disposable items that can be removed from attachment to troughs <b>150</b><i>a </i>and <b>150</b><i>b </i>after use and discarded (while oral retractor device <b>100</b> can be reused after decontamination).</p>
<p id="p-0040" num="0039">Troughs <b>150</b><i>a </i>and <b>150</b><i>b </i>apply the retraction force to separate maxilla <b>14</b> and mandible <b>12</b>. In some embodiments, a single maxillary trough <b>150</b><i>a </i>and a single mandibular trough <b>150</b><i>b </i>are included as part of oral retractor device <b>100</b>. In some such embodiments, no maxillary arch member <b>116</b><i>a </i>or mandibular arch member <b>116</b><i>b </i>are included as part of oral retractor device <b>100</b>. When a single maxillary trough <b>150</b><i>a </i>and a single mandibular trough <b>150</b><i>b </i>are included as part of oral retractor device <b>100</b>, either a single oral retractor device <b>100</b> can be used for a patient, or two oral retractor devices <b>100</b> can be used for a patient (one on each side of the patient's mouth). In such a case, the second oral retractor device <b>100</b> can be a mirror image of the oral retractor device <b>100</b> as shown. In such a case, no maxillary arch member <b>116</b><i>a </i>and mandibular arch member <b>116</b><i>b </i>are included as part of oral retractor device <b>100</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0041" num="0040">Alternatively, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>9</b></figref>, in some embodiments two maxillary troughs <b>150</b><i>a </i>and two mandibular troughs <b>150</b><i>b </i>are included as part of a bilateral oral retractor device <b>100</b>&#x2032;. In some such embodiments, maxillary arch member <b>116</b><i>a </i>extends between the two maxillary troughs <b>150</b><i>a</i>, and mandibular arch member <b>116</b><i>b </i>extends between the two mandibular troughs <b>150</b><i>b</i>. Accordingly, each of both maxillary troughs <b>150</b><i>a </i>and each of both mandibular troughs <b>150</b><i>b </i>can apply retraction forces to open the patient's mouth.</p>
<p id="p-0042" num="0041">In some embodiments, maxillary arch member <b>116</b><i>a </i>and/or mandibular arch member <b>116</b><i>b </i>are adjustable to allow for a customized fit for a particular patient's mouth (e.g., the ability to adjust to different mandibular/maxillary arch widths). For example, maxillary arch member <b>116</b><i>a </i>and/or mandibular arch member <b>116</b><i>b </i>can include one or more hinges, telescopic joints, and the like. In some embodiments, maxillary arch member <b>116</b><i>a </i>and/or mandibular arch member <b>116</b><i>b </i>can be malleable members that can be custom formed to provide a suitable fit for a particular patient's mouth size and shape.</p>
<p id="p-0043" num="0042">In some embodiments, mandibular arch member <b>116</b><i>b </i>includes an attachment member <b>156</b> that can be used to secure tongue <b>16</b> in an extended orientation, so that tongue <b>16</b> is out of the way for optimal access to the throat. For example, in some cases a suture stitch can be used to attach tongue <b>16</b> to attachment member <b>156</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0044" num="0043">In some embodiments, maxillary trough <b>150</b><i>a </i>and/or mandibular trough <b>150</b><i>b </i>include one or more through-holes <b>152</b><i>a </i>and <b>152</b><i>b </i>respectively. Through-holes <b>152</b><i>a </i>and <b>152</b><i>b </i>can be used, along with bone screws, to rigidly couple maxillary trough <b>150</b><i>a </i>to maxilla <b>14</b> and/or mandibular trough <b>150</b><i>b </i>to mandible <b>12</b> respectively. In some cases, the use of self-tapping screws in conjunction with through-holes <b>152</b><i>a </i>and <b>152</b><i>b </i>may be advantageous for stabilization of oral retraction device <b>100</b> in a dentulous or edentulous patient, and would result in limited instrumentation/crowding within the oral cavity.</p>
<p id="p-0045" num="0044">In some embodiments, retraction portion <b>140</b> includes a mandibular trough adjustment mechanism <b>154</b>. Using mandibular trough adjustment mechanism <b>154</b>, mandibular trough <b>150</b><i>b </i>can be positionally adjusted in relation to maxillary trough <b>150</b><i>a </i>to increase or decrease mandibular distraction. That is, mandible <b>12</b> can be moved anteriorly and posteriorly in relation to maxilla <b>14</b> by adjusting mandibular trough adjustment mechanism <b>154</b>. By moving mandible <b>12</b> anteriorly in relation to maxilla <b>14</b>, access to the rear of the mouth and throat is generally enhanced.</p>
<p id="p-0046" num="0045">Mandibular trough adjustment mechanism <b>154</b> can be a variety of different types of mechanisms. For example, in some embodiments mandibular trough adjustment mechanism <b>154</b> can be a rack and pinion gear arrangement. In some embodiments, mandibular trough adjustment mechanism <b>154</b> can be a lead screw arrangement. In some embodiments, mandibular trough adjustment mechanism <b>154</b> includes a ratcheting mechanism.</p>
<p id="p-0047" num="0046">In some embodiments, mandibular trough adjustment mechanism <b>154</b> facilitates an adjustment up to about 1 cm of travel. In some embodiments, mandibular trough adjustment mechanism <b>154</b> facilitates an adjustment up to about 2 cm of travel.</p>
<p id="p-0048" num="0047">Mandibular trough adjustment mechanism <b>154</b> can include a numeric mandible distraction scale <b>156</b>. Mandible distraction scale <b>156</b> can provide a quantitative indication of the extent of the mandibular distraction. In some embodiments, a force sensor is included that provides the clinician with an indication of the distraction force applied by mandibular trough adjustment mechanism <b>154</b> onto the patient's mandible <b>12</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0049" num="0048">Referring also to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref>, a transoral retractor instrument <b>200</b> can be used to apply additional retraction to tongue <b>16</b>.
