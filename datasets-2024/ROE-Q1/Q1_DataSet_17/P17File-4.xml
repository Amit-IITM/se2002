<p id="p-0014" num="0013">To solve the problem, the present invention provides a method for cleaning medical equipment by scrubbing the equipment with a melamine-formaldehyde foam comprising an antibacterial active composition, wherein the melamine-formaldehyde foam is prepared from a melamine-formaldehyde precondensate, wherein the molar ratio melamine to formaldehyde of the melamine-formaldehyde precondensate is smaller than 0.5.</p>
<p id="p-0015" num="0014">Preferred embodiments of the method according to the invention are described in claims <b>2</b> to <b>7</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0016" num="0015">The melamine-formaldehyde foam may be produced by heating and foaming an aqueous mixture M using microwave radiation, said mixture M comprising at least one melamine-formaldehyde precondensate, at least one curative, at least one surfactant, at least one blowing agent. A suitable process is described in WO 2014/037233.</p>
<p id="p-0017" num="0016">Commercially available melamine-formaldehyde precondensates are useful for a multiplicity of fields of use, for example for further processing into glues. Melamine formaldehyde precondensates comprising sulfite groups are advantageous for use in some of these fields. Such sulfite group-containing melamine-formaldehyde precondensates are obtainable for example as described in EP-B 37470 whereby from 1% to 20% by weight of sodium disulfite is incorporated in the course of the condensation of melamine and formaldehyde to obtain co-condensed sulfite groups.</p>
<p id="p-0018" num="0017">For the processes of the present invention, however, the melamine-formaldehyde precondensate comprises preferably less than 1 wt.-%, preferably less than 0.1 wt.-% of sulfite groups, most preferably the melamine-formaldehyde precondensate is essentially free of sulfite groups.</p>
<p id="p-0019" num="0018">The mechanical/elastic properties or the melamine-formaldehyde foams are dependent on the molar melamine to formaldehyde ratio (M:F) of the melamine-formaldehyde precondensate. Preferably the molar ratio melamine to formaldehyde of the melamine-formaldehyde precondensate is smaller than 0.5 and more preferably is in the range from 1:2.1 to 1:3.9 and most preferably in the range from 1:2.5 to 1:3.5. The molar ratio of the melamine to formaldehyde used for preparing the melamine-formaldehyde precondensate may be determined by nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy and integration of the peak area of the methylene and methylol bridging units.</p>
<p id="p-0020" num="0019">The melamine-formaldehyde precondensate in addition to melamine and formaldehyde may comprise up to 50% by weight and preferably up to 20% by weight (all based on the weight of co-condensed melamine formaldehyde precondensate) of other thermoset-formers and up to 50% by weight and preferably up to 20% by weight (all based on the weight of co-condensed melamine formaldehyde precondensate) of other aldehydes in co-condensed form. Useful thermoset formers include for example: alkyl- and aryl-alkyl-substituted melamine, urea, urethanes, carboxamides, dicyandiamide, guanidine, sulfurylamide, sulfonamides, aliphatic amines, glycols, phenol and its derivatives. Examples of useful other aldehydes are acetaldehyde, trimethylolacetaldehyde, acrolein, benzaldehyde, furfurol, glyoxal, glutaraldehyde, phthalaldehyde and terephthalaldehyde. Particular preference is given to an unmodified melamine-formaldehyde precondensate, i.e., a melamine-formaldehyde precondensate devoid of any other thermoset formers or other aldehydes.</p>
<p id="p-0021" num="0020">Anionic, cationic and nonionic surfactants and also mixtures thereof can be used as emulsifier for the emulsification of the blowing agent and stabilization of the foam.</p>
<p id="p-0022" num="0021">Useful anionic surfactants include for example diphenylene oxide sulfonates, alkane and alkylbenzenesulfonates, alkylnaphthalenesulfonates, olefinsulfonates, alkyl ether sulfonates, fatty alcohol sulfates, ether sulfates, &#x3b1;-sulfo fatty acid esters, acylaminoalkanesulfonates, acyl isethionates, alkyl ether carboxylates, N-acylsarcosinates, alkyl and alkylether phosphates. Useful nonionic surfactants include alkylphenol polyglycol ethers, fatty alcohol polyglycol ethers, fatty acid polyglycol ethers, fatty acid alkanolamides, ethylene oxide-propylene oxide block copolymers, amine oxides, glycerol fatty acid esters, sorbitan esters and alkylpolyglycosides. Useful cationic emulsifiers include for example alkyltriammonium salts, alkylbenzyldimethylammonium salts and alkylpyridinium salts.</p>
<p id="p-0023" num="0022">The emulsifiers are preferably added in amounts from 0.2% to 5% by weight, based on the melamine-formaldehyde precondensate.</p>
<p id="p-0024" num="0023">Preferably a surfactant mixture is used as emulsifier comprising a mixture of 50 to 90 wt.-% of at least one anionic surfactant and 10 to 50 wt.-% of at least one nonionic surfactant, wherein the weight percentages are each based on the total weight of the surfactant mixture. Most preferably a surfactant mixture of 50 to 90 wt. % at least one alkanesulfonate and 10 to 50 wt.-% of at least on alkyl polyethylene glycol ether is used.</p>
<p id="p-0025" num="0024">As curatives it is possible to use acidic compounds which catalyze the further condensation of the melamine formaldehyde resin. The amount of these curatives is generally in the range from 0.01% to 20% by weight and preferably in the range from 0.05% to 5% by weight, all based on the precondensate. Useful acidic compounds include organic and inorganic acids, for example selected from the group consisting of hydrochloric acid, sulfuric acid, phosphoric acid, nitric acid, formic acid, acetic acid, oxalic acid, toluenesulfonic acids, amidosulfonic acids, acid anhydrides and mixtures thereof.</p>
<p id="p-0026" num="0025">Preferably formic acid is used as curative.</p>
<p id="p-0027" num="0026">The mixture comprises a blowing agent. The amount of blowing agent in the mixture generally depends on the desired density for the foam. Preferably the amount in relation to the melamine-formaldehyde precondensate is chosen in an amount that the density of the foam is 8 to 12 kg/m<sup>3</sup>, more preferably 9 to 11 kg/m<sup>3</sup>.</p>
<p id="p-0028" num="0027">In principle, the process of the present invention can use both physical and chemical blowing agents. Useful blowing agents include for example hydrocarbons, such as pentane, hexane, halogenated, more particularly chlorinated and/or fluorinated, hydrocarbons, for example methylene chloride, chloroform, trichloroethane, chlorofluorocarbons, hydrochlorofluorocarbons (HCFCs), alcohols, for example methanol, ethanol, n propanol or isopropanol, ethers, ketones and esters, for example methyl formate, ethyl formate, methyl acetate or ethyl acetate, in liquid form or air, nitrogen or carbon dioxide as gases.</p>
<p id="p-0029" num="0028">The mixture further comprises at least one blowing agent. This blowing agent is present in the mixture in an amount of 0.5% to 60% by weight, preferably 1% to 40% by weight and more preferably 1.5% to 30% by weight, based on the melamine-formaldehyde precondensate. It is preferable to add a physical blowing agent having a boiling point between 0 and 80&#xb0; C. Preferably pentane is used as blowing agent.</p>
<p id="p-0030" num="0029">The precondensate being foamed up generally by heating the suspension of the melamine-formaldehyde precondensate to obtain a foamed material.</p>
<p id="p-0031" num="0030">The introduction of energy may preferably be effected via electromagnetic radiation, for example via high-frequency radiation at 5 to 400 kW, preferably 5 to 200 kW and more preferably 9 to 120 kW per kilogram of the mixture used in a frequency range from 0.2 to 100 GHz, preferably 0.5 to 10 GHz. Magnetrons are a useful source of dielectric radiation, and one magnetron can be used or two or more magnetrons at the same time.</p>
<p id="p-0032" num="0031">The mixture to be blown is irradiated immediately on emerging from the foaming die. The blowing agent evaporates, the resin mixture foams up and at the same time cures through. The foamed materials produced are finally dried, removing residual water and blowing agent from the foam. To improve elasticity the foam may be tempered and/or pressed.</p>
<p id="p-0033" num="0032">The melamine-formaldehyde foam preferably has an open-cell structure. Preferably the melamine-formaldehyde foam has an open-cell content of more than 50% and more particularly more than 95%, when measured according to DIN ISO 4590. Preferably the density of the foam is 8 to 12 kg/m<sup>3</sup>, more preferably 9 to 11 kg/m<sup>3</sup>.</p>
<p id="p-0034" num="0033">The melamine-formaldehyde foam comprises an antibacterial active composition, comprising one or more antibacterial active substances. Suitable antibacterial active substances include alcohols, such as ethanol, hexanol, n-propanol or isopropanol, quaternary ammonium compounds, such as benzalkonium chloride, or halogenated compounds, such as triclosan, 2,4-dichlorbenzyl alcohol, chlorhexidine gluconate or povidone-iodine.</p>
<p id="p-0035" num="0034">Preferably a solution or dispersion comprising isopropyl alcohol, chlorhexidine gluconate or povidone-iodine or mixtures thereof is used as antibacterial active composition.</p>
<p id="p-0036" num="0035">Preferably the open-cell melamine-formaldehyde foam comprises from 0.1 to 10 wt.-% of the antibacterial active composition.</p>
<p id="p-0037" num="0036">The antibacterial active composition or substances may be incorporated to the melamine-formaldehyde foam before the step of foaming a precondensate by heating a solution or dispersion of a melamine-formaldehyde precondensate in the presence of a foaming agent as described in WO 2008/110475 and/or a melamine-formaldehyde foam may be coated or filled with the antibacterial active composition. Preferably the melamine-formaldehyde foam is soaked with a solution or dispersion of the antibacterial active composition and squeezed thereafter.</p>
<p id="p-0038" num="0037">Preferably the melamine-formaldehyde foam has an open-cell structure which is totally or partially filled with a solution or dispersion comprising isopropyl alcohol, chlorhexidine gluconate or povidone-iodine or mixtures thereof as antibacterial active composition.</p>
<p id="p-0039" num="0038">The method according to the invention is especially useful for removing biofilm depositions from medical equipment.</p>
<p id="p-0040" num="0039">Preferably the method is applied for cleaning a catheter or endoscope, most preferably a Central Venous Catheter (CVC) system port, as medical equipment.</p>

<heading id="h-0002" level="2">Test Procedure for Cleaning Test</heading>
<p id="p-0042" num="0041">A test soil based on hand cream and carbon black was prepared and applied to tiles with a doctor blade to yield a film height of 300 &#x3bc;m. The material was subsequently burned onto tiles in an oven at 160&#xb0; C. for 10 minutes. Tiles prepared by the aforementioned method were cleaned with melamine formaldehyde sponges and the number of strokes needed to remove the soil from the surface was measured.</p>
<heading id="h-0003" level="2">Ram Pressure Value [N]:</heading>
<p id="p-0043" num="0042">All stamps pressure value measurements for evaluation of the mechanical/elastic properties of the melamine/formaldehyde foams were carried out as follows: one cylindrical steel die with a diameter of 8 mm and a height of 10 cm was applied at right angles in a cylindrical foam sample having a diameter of 11 cm and a height of 5 cm is pressed, to the foam sample broke. Up to the tearing of the foam sample maximum force applied by the plunger (unit: N), in the following also referred to as ram pressure value, provides information about the quality of the foam mechanically/elastic (reported in table 1 in each case the measurements were performed parallel to the rise direction of the foam). The larger the punch pressure values are, the better the mechanical/elastic properties of the melamine/formaldehyde foams.</p>

<heading id="h-0010" level="1">Examples 6 and 7</heading>
<p id="p-0052" num="0054">70 parts by weight of a spray-dried melamine/formaldehyde precondensate mf-1 was dissolved in 30 parts by weight of water.

<p id="p-0053" num="0055">The effect of adding 0.1 wt % AgNO<sub>3 </sub>as antimicrobial agent was tested by the above described test procedure for cleaning test for M:F ratios of greater (Comparative Examples C3 and C4) and smaller 0.5 (Examples 5 and 6) and summarized in Table 2. In both cases the pristine resins (Examples C3 and 5) perform better than the silver-modified systems (Examples C4 and 6). The mechanical/elastic properties (ram pressure) of systems with M:F &#x3c;0.5 (Examples 5 and 6) are better and less strokes are needed for cleaning than for systems with M:F &#x3e;0.5 (Examples C3 and C4).</p>
