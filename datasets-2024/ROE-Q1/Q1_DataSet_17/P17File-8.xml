<heading level="1" id="h-0005">DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE EXEMPLARY EMBODIMENT</heading>
<p id="p-0021" num="0020">The present disclosure will hereinafter be described in detail with reference to an exemplary embodiment. To make the technical problems to be solved, technical solutions and beneficial effects of the present disclosure more apparent, the present disclosure is described in further detail together with the figures and the embodiment. It should be understood the specific embodiment described hereby is only to explain the disclosure, not intended to limit the disclosure.</p>
<p id="p-0022" num="0021">Please refer to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>, an e-cigarette <b>100</b> is provided for the present invention, the e-cigarette <b>100</b> includes a housing body <b>1</b> with a smoking mouth <b>11</b> at the top, an atomizer <b>2</b> accommodated in the housing body <b>1</b> and spaced apart from the smoking mouth <b>11</b>, a smoke chamber <b>3</b> provided between the atomizer <b>2</b> and the smoking mouth <b>11</b>, a first containment cavity <b>10</b> connected with the smoking mouth <b>11</b>, and a MEMS sensor <b>4</b> provided in the first containment cavity <b>10</b>. The MEMS sensor <b>4</b> is welded and fixed in the first containment cavity <b>10</b> of the housing body <b>1</b>. The tar is injected into the smoke chamber <b>3</b>. The first containment cavity <b>10</b> is located at the bottom end of the housing body <b>1</b> and is connected with the smoking mouth <b>11</b> through the smoke channel <b>13</b>. The bottom end of the housing body <b>1</b> is also provided with a first through hole <b>12</b> that is connected with the outside world and the MEMS sensor.</p>
<p id="p-0023" num="0022">Please refer to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref>, the MEMS sensor <b>4</b> in the e-cigarette of the first embodiment provided for the present invention is shown, the MEMS sensor <b>4</b> includes a printed circuit board <b>43</b>, a first housing <b>41</b> connected with the printed circuit board <b>43</b> to form a second containment cavity <b>40</b>, a MEMS chip <b>44</b> and an ASIC chip <b>45</b> placed in the second containment cavity <b>40</b>, and a second housing <b>42</b> which covers the first housing <b>41</b> and is connected to the printed circuit board <b>43</b>. The first housing <b>41</b> and the second housing <b>42</b> are spaced apart to form a third containment cavity <b>401</b>. Since the third containment cavity <b>401</b> has a certain volume, it can store a certain amount of tar, which effectively increases the oil resistance. In addition, the first housing <b>41</b> and the second housing <b>42</b> can both be metal housing. The first housing <b>41</b> and the second housing <b>42</b> increase the surface area of the housing, which is conducive to condensing gaseous tar, preventing gaseous tar from entering the interior of the MEMS sensor <b>4</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0024" num="0023">In the present invention, the printed circuit board <b>430</b> is provided with a second through hole <b>430</b> that connect the first through hole <b>12</b> and the back cavity <b>440</b> of the MEMS chip <b>44</b>, and the first housing <b>41</b> is provided with a third through hole <b>410</b> that connect the second containment cavity <b>40</b> and the third containment cavity <b>401</b>. The third through hole <b>410</b> may be one or multiple, and the third through hole <b>410</b> is used for gas circulation. A gap <b>400</b> connecting the first containment cavity <b>10</b> and the third containment cavity <b>401</b> is provided between the second housing <b>42</b> and the printed circuit board <b>43</b>. The gap <b>400</b> is small enough for airflow to pass through, and can also effectively prevent the entry of liquid tar.</p>
<p id="p-0025" num="0024">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref>, the printed circuit board <b>43</b> is provided with a first golden finger <b>432</b> connected to the second housing <b>42</b>, and the second housing <b>42</b> is square. The first golden finger <b>432</b> includes a plurality of first golden fingers <b>432</b> spaced apart to form the gap <b>400</b>. A plurality of first golden fingers <b>432</b> are provided at corner positions of the second housing <b>42</b>, respectively. The first golden finger <b>432</b> is preferably copper foil. Therefore, the first golden finger <b>432</b> can not only play the role of electrically connecting the second housing <b>42</b>, but also form the gap <b>400</b> during the process of manufacturing the first golden finger <b>432</b>, and the size of the gap <b>400</b> can be set as required. Not only can it prevent liquid tar from entering the interior of the MEMS sensor <b>4</b>, but also the operation is simple and cost saving. In addition, the printed circuit board <b>43</b> can also be provided with a second golden finger <b>433</b> connected to the first housing <b>41</b>, and the second golden finger <b>433</b> is arranged with a continuous annular structure. It can play the role of electrically connecting the first housing <b>41</b> and protecting the internal chip of the MEMS sensor <b>4</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0026" num="0025">A conductive terminal <b>431</b> is provided in the printed circuit board <b>43</b>, and the ASIC chip <b>45</b> is electrically connected to the conductive terminal <b>431</b> through a gold bonding wire <b>46</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0027" num="0026">A microprocessor may be provided on the printed circuit board <b>43</b>, or a microprocessor may be integrated on the ASIC chip <b>45</b>. the MEMS chip <b>44</b> includes a back plate <b>441</b> and a vibration diaphragm <b>442</b> spaced from the back plate <b>441</b>. Due to the pressure difference acting on the vibration diaphragm <b>442</b> from the second through hole <b>430</b> and the third through hole <b>410</b>, the vibration diaphragm <b>442</b> moves towards the smoking mouth <b>11</b>, and the capacitance between the back plate <b>441</b> and the vibration diaphragm <b>442</b> changes. The ASIC chip <b>45</b> detects this change and outputs an electric signal. After the signal is processed, the microprocessor will receive the signal and output the corresponding signal to drive the atomizer to work, thereby generating smoke, which is introduced into the human mouth along the smoke channel.</p>
<p id="p-0028" num="0027">It is to be understood, however, that even though numerous characteristics and advantages of the present exemplary embodiment have been set forth in the foregoing description, together with details of the structures and functions of the embodiment, the disclosure is illustrative only, and changes may be made in detail, especially in matters of shape, size, and arrangement of parts within the principles of the invention to the full extent indicated by the broad general meaning of the terms where the appended claims are expressed.</p>
