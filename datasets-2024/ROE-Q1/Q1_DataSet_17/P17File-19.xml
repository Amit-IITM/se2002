<abstract id="abstract">
<p id="p-0001" num="0000">An electronic device includes a housing sidewall defining an opening and a display component, such as a display cover, disposed in the opening to form a gap between the housing sidewall and the display component. In at least one example, the cavity is defined by the sidewall and the display cover with the cavity in fluid communication with an external environment through the gap. In at least one example, an epoxy component at least partially defines the cavity and can be in direct contact with the housing sidewall.</p>

<p id="p-0003" num="0002">The present disclosure relates generally to electronic devices. More particularly, the present disclosure relates to wearable electronic devices.</p>
<heading id="h-0003" level="1">BACKGROUND</heading>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">Electronic devices are increasingly being designed with device portability in mind, for example, to allow users to use these devices in a wide variety of situations and environments. In the context of wearable devices, these devices can be designed to include many different functionalities and to be operated in many different locations and environments. The components of an electronic device, for example, the processors, memory, antennas, display, and other components can partially determine a level of performance of the electronic device. Further, the arrangement of these components with respect to one another in the device can also determine the level of overall performance of the electronic device.</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">Continued advances in electronic devices and their components have enabled considerable increases in performance. Existing components and structures for electronic devices can, however, limit the levels of performance of such devices. For example, while some components can achieve high levels of performance in some situations, the inclusion of multiple components in devices sized to enhance portability can limit the performance of the components, and thus, the performance of the device. Consequently, further tailoring and arrangement of components for electronic devices to provide additional or enhanced functionality, without introducing or increasing undesirable device properties, can be desirable.</p>

<p id="p-0099" num="0098">In at least one example, the display cover <b>222</b> defines a top surface disposed in a plane. The plane can be flush with or set below the upper peripheral edge of the sidewalls <b>228</b>. In this way, when the wearable electronic device <b>200</b> comes into contact with a surface or object at or near the upper surface of the display cover <b>222</b> and/or the upper peripheral edge of the sidewalls <b>228</b>, contact and potential damage to the display cover <b>222</b> can be reduced. In one example, the display cover <b>222</b> is set flush with or below the upper peripheral edges of the sidewalls <b>228</b> to protect the display cover <b>222</b> from damage.</p>
<p id="p-0100" num="0099">In at least one example, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b>A</figref>, the sidewalls <b>228</b> can define a first side of the wearable electronic device <b>200</b> having a recessed feature in which a crown <b>210</b> is positioned. The crown <b>210</b> can be a part of a turn dial button or other functional knob configured to be manipulated by the user. The crown <b>210</b> can be disposed in the recessed portion, as noted above, such that first side of the sidewalls <b>228</b> extend outward and at least partially around the crown <b>210</b>. In this way, contacts and bumps against of other objects against the first side of the sidewall <b>228</b> during use can contact the sidewall <b>228</b> without pressing or turning the crown <b>210</b>. In this way, the recessed portion of the first side of the sidewalls <b>228</b> prevents inadvertent manipulation of the crown <b>210</b>. The button <b>209</b> shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b>A</figref> can also be at least partially surrounded by an outwardly extending portion of the sidewall <b>228</b>, such that the button <b>209</b> is disposed within a recess thereof, to protect the button <b>209</b> form inadvertent contacts.</p>
<p id="p-0101" num="0100">In at least one example, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b>B</figref>, the sidewalls <b>228</b> can define a second side opposite the first side shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b>A</figref>. In such an example, the wearable electronic device <b>200</b> can include a first speaker vent <b>249</b>, a second speaker vent <b>247</b>, and a button <b>208</b> disposed between the first speaker vent <b>249</b> and the second speaker vent <b>247</b>. The first and second speaker vents <b>249</b>, <b>247</b> can provide fluid communication from a common speaker volume behind the sidewall <b>228</b> (e.g., within an internal volume defined by the sidewalls <b>228</b>) and the external environment. The button <b>208</b> can be disposed between the first and second speaker vents <b>249</b>, <b>247</b> to save space and provide a compact design without interrupting the functionality of the one or more speakers communicating with the external environment through the first and second speaker vents <b>247</b>, <b>249</b>.</p>

While the contact between the wave ring <b>526</b> and the electrical contact <b>572</b> is shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>9</b>A-<b>9</b>C</figref> (as well as in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>12</b> and <b>13</b></figref> below) as resulting from an undulation or circumferential variation (or wave) in the wave ring <b>526</b>, the electrical contacts can be made by any number of discrete or continuous geometries such as indents or protrusions on the wave ring <b>526</b>, or by discrete or continuous protrusions on the housing.

<p id="p-0126" num="0125">In at least one example, the upper portion <b>532</b> of the sidewall <b>528</b> can be electrically isolated from the lower portion <b>534</b> via the intermediary and non-conductive middle portion <b>536</b>. In this way, the upper portion <b>532</b> can be a resonating element of an antenna of the device <b>500</b> with the lower portion <b>534</b> of the sidewall <b>528</b> acting as an electrical grounding plane relative to the resonating plane of the upper portion <b>532</b>.

<p id="p-0127" num="0126">The wearable electronic devices described herein can include antennas configured to send and receive electromagnetic signals during use. Incorporating effective antennas into small, compact devices such as wearable electronic watches can be challenging because the greater the distance between a resonating plane and a grounding plane of an antenna, among other factors, the better the performance of the antenna will be. However, space is often limited to create the required Z-distances necessary in compact wearable electronic devices. In devices described herein, the housing and sidewalls of the device can be electrically separated into multiple portions to create resonating elements and grounding elements of an antenna with sufficient separation (Z-distance) therebetween for the housing itself to act as an antenna. However, this design has its own challenges, including electrically connecting the resonating element to a PCB, processor, or other electronic device without reducing the Z-distance of the antenna. Wearable electronic devices described herein are configured to overcome these challenges.</p>
<p id="p-0128" num="0127">Along these lines, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>10</b>A and <b>10</b>B</figref> show a top perspective view and a top view, respectively, of a subassembly of a device <b>600</b>, according to the present disclosure. The subassembly includes housing sidewall <b>628</b> that includes the upper portion <b>632</b>, lower portion <b>634</b>, and middle portion <b>636</b> separating the upper portion <b>632</b> from the lower portion <b>634</b>. As noted above, the upper portion <b>632</b> and the lower portion <b>632</b> can include electrically conductive material and the middle portion <b>636</b> can include electrically insulating or non-conductive material such that the upper portion <b>632</b> of the sidewall <b>628</b> forms a resonating element of an antenna separated by a distance in the vertical or &#x201c;Z&#x201d; direction (or a &#x201c;Z-distance&#x201d;) relative to the electrical grounding plane of the lower portion <b>634</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0129" num="0128">The epoxy component <b>638</b> can also be bonded to an inside of the sidewall <b>628</b> and to the middle portion <b>636</b> and the lower portion <b>634</b>. In addition, the wave ring <b>626</b> is also shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>10</b>A</figref>. A close-up view of the subassembly from a top view is shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>10</b>C</figref>, with the close-up region indicated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>10</b>B</figref>, to illustrate a portion of the wave ring <b>626</b> extending away from the sidewall <b>628</b> to make contact with an electrical contact in the internal volume of the device. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>10</b>B</figref>, the interior portion of the wave ring <b>626</b> includes a number of dimples or protrusions <b>640</b> configured to engage electrical contacts <b>572</b> that can extend through the insulating material <b>576</b> and electrically connect to the PCB <b>574</b> (as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>9</b>C</figref>). As noted above, in addition or alternative to the protrusions <b>640</b> on the wave ring <b>626</b>, protrusions can be formed on the housing to facilitate or ensure a secure connection between the wave ring <b>626</b> and the electrical contacts <b>572</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0130" num="0129"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>10</b>A</figref> also illustrates a cutout <b>650</b> formed in the inner surface of the housing sidewall <b>628</b>. As shown, the cutout <b>650</b> extends into the housing sidewall <b>628</b> below the middle portion <b>636</b> and the epoxy portion <b>638</b>. According to one example, the cutout <b>650</b> is formed by machining or otherwise removing a slot of the housing sidewall <b>628</b> to create a cavity on the upper portion of the interior volume, prior to assembly of the device <b>600</b>. As shown, the cutout <b>650</b> provides for additional volume within the housing sidewall <b>628</b> that can be used for connections or other housings. According to one example, the cutout provides an isolated volume where component connections can be made, such as for microphones or pressure sensors that are typically located near the exterior of the device <b>600</b>, without consuming valuable interior volume. In one example, board to board connections, such as hot-bar soldering, can be performed on the main PCB within the main cavity, and a flexible cable can then extend from the main PCT to the cutout <b>650</b> formed in the inner surface of the housing sidewall <b>628</b>. Within the cutout <b>650</b>, according to one example, a tray <b>652</b> that can be fastened to the housing can include a circuit board <b>654</b> with any number of components <b>656</b>, such as connectors, components, gyroscopes, accelerometers, etc. that can then be connected to the PCB via the flexible cable. According to this example, the transition of a number of connections to previously unused portions of the housing sidewall <b>628</b> allows for added room within the housing for additional battery volume or the inclusion of additional connectors or features on the main PCB.</p>

<p id="p-0132" num="0131"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>11</b></figref> shows another cross-sectional view similar to the cross-sectional views shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>9</b>A-<b>9</b>C</figref>, where a sidewall <b>728</b> includes an upper portion <b>732</b>, a middle portion <b>736</b>, and a lower portion <b>734</b>. The sidewall <b>728</b> defines an opening <b>732</b> in which a display assembly <b>706</b> is disposed, the display assembly <b>706</b> including a display cover <b>722</b> and one or more other display layers or components <b>724</b>. An epoxy component <b>738</b> can contact the lower portion <b>734</b> and the middle portion <b>736</b> as shown and one or more other layers or components can be stacked or disposed between the display cover <b>722</b> and the epoxy component <b>738</b>, for example the lth antenna layer <b>772</b> and the insulating material <b>776</b>. In at least one example, the insulating material <b>776</b>, which can also be referred to herein as a mounting component <b>776</b>, can structurally support one or more other components, including the electrical contact <b>772</b> extending there through and/or the display cover <b>722</b> or other components <b>724</b> of the display assembly <b>706</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0133" num="0132">In at least one example, the display mounting component <b>776</b> may be formed from a molded material, such as a molded insulating material, including a polymer (e.g., a low-injection-pressure-overmolded polymer). The material that forms component <b>776</b> may be epoxy, polyurethane, and/or other polymer materials. Thermoplastic and/or thermoset polymer may be used in forming component <b>776</b>. Heat and/or light (e.g., ultraviolet light) may be used in curing the polymer forming component <b>776</b>. As one illustrative example, component <b>776</b> may be formed from a thermoset structural adhesive such as a one-part heat-cured epoxy. Other polymer(s) may be used, if desired. Vacuum may be applied to the interior of a mold to help draw liquid polymer into a desired shape within a mold during formation of component <b>776</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0134" num="0133">One or more surfaces of component <b>776</b> can serve as a reference surface (datum) that helps establish a desired physical relationship between component <b>776</b> and other portions of a device including the display assembly <b>706</b>. As an example, component <b>776</b> can be attached to an opposing surface of a housing using a layer of adhesive. The shape and location of component <b>776</b> relative to display cover layer <b>722</b>, display layers <b>724</b>, and other structures in display <b>706</b> can help establish a desired position for display <b>706</b> relative to a device housing. The upper surface of component <b>776</b> can be molded directly to the underside of display cover <b>722</b> to help form an environmental seal. In some examples, however, the display assembly <b>706</b> can include a separate seal that can aid in forming an environmental seal between the display assembly <b>706</b> and a housing.</p>
<p id="p-0135" num="0134">The location of the display mounting component is indicated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>11</b> and <b>12</b></figref>. As can be see, the display mounting component <b>776</b> extends around a periphery of the PCB <b>774</b>. As the PCB <b>774</b> is smaller than the display cover <b>722</b>, the molded insulating material of the display mounting component <b>776</b> may be adjacent to an edge of the PCB <b>774</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0136" num="0135">In some examples, however, a display assembly <b>706</b> for an electronic device can include a PCB <b>774</b> that has one or more major dimensions, such as a width and/or height, which are substantially similar to the corresponding major dimension of the display cover <b>722</b> or other components <b>724</b> of the display assembly <b>706</b>. By using a PCB <b>774</b> with these dimensional relationships, a tail of the display layer <b>724</b> can be made flush with a major surface of the PCB <b>774</b> so that only a single shut-off is needed during the molding operation which can be used to form the display mounting component. Accordingly, the molded insulating material of the display mounting component <b>776</b> can be disposed on a major surface of the PCB <b>774</b> and adjacent to a periphery thereon while also at least partially surrounding the flexible tail of an associated display layers <b>724</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0137" num="0136">In the present example, the molded material of the display mounting component <b>776</b> can also serve to affix the display assembly <b>706</b> to the device housing sidewall <b>728</b>, or at least to a component of the sidewall <b>728</b> such as the lower portion <b>734</b>, and/or to provide an environmental seal between the display cover <b>722</b> and the device housing sidewall <b>728</b>. In some examples, the display mounting component <b>776</b> can at least partially define an exterior surface of the device, such as at an upper surface of the upper portion <b>732</b>. Thus, in some examples, a portion of the insulating molded material of the display mounting component <b>776</b> that defines the exterior surface of the device can be positioned between the display cover <b>722</b> and a sidewall <b>728</b> of the housing. Further, in some examples, the portion of the exterior surface defined by the display mounting component <b>776</b> can be substantially level, in line with, and/or flush with portion of the exterior surface defined by the housing sidewall <b>728</b> and/or display cover <b>722</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0138" num="0137">As noted above, in order to electrically connect the upper portion <b>732</b> of the sidewall <b>728</b>, as a resonating element of an antenna, the electrical connector <b>772</b> can extend through the insulating material <b>776</b> from the wave ring <b>726</b> to the PCB <b>774</b> and the wave ring <b>726</b> can contact the upper portion <b>732</b> of the sidewall <b>728</b> at another point or location along the length of the wave ring <b>726</b>, similar to that shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>9</b>B</figref> and described above. In this way, while the PCB <b>774</b> is disposed lower than the upper portion <b>732</b> of the sidewall <b>728</b>, the upper portion <b>732</b> of the sidewall <b>728</b> can predominantly define an upper resonating plane separated from the grounding plane defined by the lower portion <b>734</b> of the sidewall <b>728</b>. This increased Z-distance between the upper and lower portions <b>732</b>, <b>734</b> of the sidewall <b>728</b> correspondingly increases the performance of the antenna of which the upper portion <b>732</b> forms a part, or at least forms a part of a resonating element thereof.</p>
<p id="p-0139" num="0138">As illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>11</b></figref>, the wavering <b>726</b> can vary in profile. According to one example, the wavering <b>726</b> is asymmetric in shape, placing the protrusion or dimple lower on the body so that it provides a better contact with the extension feature <b>784</b> of the electrical connector <b>772</b>. In other words, due to the asymmetric profile of the wave ring <b>726</b>, the dimple or protrusion sits lower in the channel formed by the sidewall <b>728</b>, and can make a more secure connection to an extension feature <b>784</b> having a lower profile. Additionally, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>11</b></figref>, the wave ring <b>726</b> can include any number of optional back dimples <b>727</b> to extend toward the wave ring <b>726</b> and towards the extension feature <b>784</b>, ensuring a consistent contact therewith, as well as promoting contact with the housing. Alternatively, or additionally, the sidewall <b>728</b> can have selective protrusions or bump-outs <b>729</b> that reduce the distance between the wave ring <b>726</b> and the extension feature <b>784</b>, ensuring a secure contact. Such added connection securement features can be especially beneficial in corners of the sidewall <b>728</b> where antenna feeds can be located.</p>

<p id="p-0184" num="0173"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>20</b>A</figref> shows an example of an electronic device <b>1800</b> that includes an outer housing <b>1802</b> defining an internal volume <b>1852</b>, a first speaker <b>1863</b> and a second speaker <b>1861</b> disposed in the internal volume <b>1852</b>, the first speaker <b>1863</b> including a frame <b>1859</b> disposed around a periphery of a diaphragm <b>1857</b> of the first speaker <b>1863</b>, a front volume <b>1855</b> defined by the outer housing, the first speaker <b>1863</b>, and the second speaker <b>1861</b>, a first back volume <b>1853</b> defined by the first speaker <b>1863</b> and the frame <b>1859</b>, and a second back volume <b>1845</b> defined by the second speaker <b>1861</b> and the frame <b>1859</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0185" num="0174">In at least one example, the electronic device <b>1800</b> can include an outer housing <b>1802</b>, an inner housing <b>1851</b> spaced apart from the outer housing <b>1802</b>, a speaker assembly disposed between the inner and outer housings <b>1802</b>, <b>1851</b>. The speaker assembly can include the first speaker <b>1863</b>, the second speaker <b>1861</b>, and the speaker frame <b>1859</b> supporting the first speaker <b>1863</b>. The device can further include the first back volume <b>1853</b> defined by the inner housing <b>1851</b> and the first speaker <b>1863</b> and the second back volume <b>1845</b> defined by the inner housing <b>1851</b> and the second speaker <b>1861</b>, with the second back volume <b>1845</b> separated from the first back volume <b>1853</b> by the speaker frame <b>1859</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0186" num="0175">Another example of the electronic device <b>1800</b> can include the outer housing <b>1802</b>, the inner housing <b>1851</b>, the speaker assembly disposed between the inner and outer housings <b>1851</b>, <b>1802</b> including the first speaker <b>1863</b> and the second speaker <b>1861</b>. The device <b>1800</b> can also include a front volume <b>1855</b> defined by the outer housing <b>1802</b> and the speaker assembly, the back volume defined by the inner housing and the speaker assembly and separated into first and second isolated portions <b>1853</b> and <b>1845</b>, respectively. In at least one example, the device <b>1800</b> can also include first vent <b>1849</b> defined by the housing <b>1802</b> through which a first end of the front volume <b>1855</b> is in fluid communication with an external environment and a second vent <b>1847</b> defined by the housing <b>1802</b> through which a second end of the front volume <b>1855</b> is in fluid communication with the external environment.</p>
<p id="p-0187" num="0176">In at least one example, the front volume <b>1855</b> can be isolated from the first and second back volumes <b>1853</b> and <b>1845</b>, respectively. The speakers <b>1863</b>, <b>1861</b> can be disposed between the front volume <b>1855</b> and the first and second back volumes <b>1853</b>, <b>1845</b> and the frame <b>1859</b> can structurally support the first speaker <b>1863</b>. In at least one example, the frame <b>1859</b> forms an air-tight seal between the first back volume <b>1853</b> and the second back volume <b>1845</b>. In addition, as noted above, the inner housing <b>1851</b> can at least partially define the first back volume <b>1853</b>. For example, the frame <b>1859</b> can include a collar <b>1843</b> and a molded seal <b>1841</b> extending from the collar <b>1843</b> toward the internal volume <b>1852</b> and contacting the inner housing <b>1851</b> to seal the first back volume <b>1853</b> as shown behind/below the first speaker <b>1863</b>. The collar <b>1843</b> can include a metal ring disposed around the speaker <b>1863</b> and configured to redirect magnetic flux around the speaker <b>1863</b>. In at least one example, the speaker frame <b>1859</b> structurally supports the second speaker <b>1861</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0188" num="0177">In one example, the first speaker <b>1863</b> is smaller than the second speaker <b>1861</b>. The first speaker <b>1863</b> can be referred to as a tweeter and be configured to output higher frequency sound waves than the larger second speaker <b>1861</b>. Accordingly, to accommodate the smaller volumetric air displacement caused by the first speaker <b>1863</b>, in at least one example, the first back volume <b>1853</b> can be smaller than the second back volume <b>1845</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0189" num="0178">In at least on example, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>20</b>A and <b>20</b>B</figref>, the electronic device <b>1800</b> can also include a valve <b>1839</b> disposed in an aperture defined by the inner housing <b>1851</b> to vent air from the first isolated portion <b>1853</b> of the back volume to the internal volume <b>1852</b>. In at least one example, the pressure valve <b>1839</b> can be configured to equalize pressure between the internal volume <b>1852</b> and the back volume <b>1853</b>. In at least one example, the valve <b>1839</b> can include a mesh and a channel passing through and defined by the inner housing <b>1851</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0190" num="0179">The shared front volume <b>1855</b> can be in fluid communication with an external environment through various vents passing through the outer housing <b>1802</b>. The location and configuration of each vent can be designed to accommodate high siren-type frequencies output by the smaller tweeter speaker (first speaker <b>1863</b>) and lower frequencies output by the second speaker <b>1861</b>. In this way, a broader range of frequencies can be output by the speaker assembly clearly and effectively.</p>
<p id="p-0191" num="0180">In at least one example, the first vent <b>1849</b> is formed of a single aperture defined by the outer housing <b>1802</b>. The second vent <b>1847</b> can include two or more apertures defined by the outer housing <b>1802</b>. In at least one example, a distance between any two adjacent apertures of the second vent <b>1847</b> can be less than a distance between any aperture of the second vent <b>1847</b> and the single aperture of the first vent <b>1849</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0192" num="0181">As noted above, the arrangement and configuration of the speaker assembly of the electronic device <b>1800</b> shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>20</b>A and <b>20</b>B</figref> enables the speaker assembly to output frequencies in the normal range of daily use, including music, voice, and other typical audio outputs, as well as loud, high frequencies in the range of above 3 kHz, 3.5 kHz, or even above 4.5 kHz from the first smaller speaker <b>1863</b> to be used as a siren. The siren can be used in conjunction with a fall-detection system of the device <b>1800</b> to alert others if the user has fallen or been injured. During other activities, for example during mountain biking, the siren can output warning signals when coming around a blind corner on a trail or the like. A guardian mode of the device <b>1800</b> could activate the siren as an assault whistle or a mugging deterrent.</p>
<p id="p-0193" num="0182">In order to fit the dual speaker assembly within a tight space between the inner housing <b>1851</b> and the outer housing <b>1802</b> of the device <b>1800</b>, some of the components discussed above and shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>20</b>A-<b>20</b>B</figref> are configured to interface with and be disposed with other component of the device <b>1800</b> to form a tight, compact, space-saving device <b>1800</b>. For example, the speaker assembly shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>20</b>A and <b>20</b>B</figref> can be disposed within the device <b>1800</b> in generally the same location as a button of the device, such that the button and the speaker assembly share the same location or portion of the internal volume of the device <b>1800</b>.

<p id="p-0198" num="0187">In order to seal off the front volume <b>1855</b> from the second back volume <b>1845</b>, the device <b>1800</b> can include a gasket <b>1825</b> surrounding the plunger <b>1837</b> and forming a fluid-tight seal between the frame <b>1859</b> and the plunger <b>1837</b>. Thus a fluid-tight seal is formed by the gasket <b>1825</b> between the front volume <b>1855</b> and the second back volume <b>1845</b>. In at least one example, the gasket can include an O-ring disposed around the plunger <b>1837</b>.

When the button <b>1808</b> is not depressed, the plunger <b>1837</b> and the electrical contact <b>1823</b> are separated so that no electrical connection is made therebetween. The electrical contact <b>1823</b> can also be referred to herein as a &#x201c;tactile switch&#x201d; or a &#x201c;tac switch.&#x201d;</p>
<p id="p-0202" num="0191">The tac switch <b>1823</b> can electrically couple and/or physically contact an electrical flex <b>1804</b> partially disposed on a top surface of the inner housing <b>1851</b> and at least partially extending under the tac switch <b>1823</b> between the tac switch <b>1823</b> and the inner housing <b>1851</b>. The flex <b>1804</b> can extend around an edge of the inner housing <b>1851</b> and continue underneath or on a lower surface, opposite the top surface of the inner housing <b>1851</b>, as shown. In one example, the bend formed in the flex <b>1804</b> as the flex rounds the edge of the inner housing <b>1851</b> from one surface to the other can, on its own, bias the portion of the flex <b>1804</b> disposed between the tac switch <b>1823</b> and the inner housing <b>1851</b> away from the inner housing <b>1851</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0203" num="0192">In order to counteract this biasing force away from the inner housing <b>1851</b>, the device <b>1800</b> can include a foot <b>1806</b> pressing downward onto the flex <b>1804</b> to keep the flex <b>1804</b> in position between the tac switch <b>1823</b> and the inner housing <b>1851</b>, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>20</b>G</figref>. The foot <b>1806</b> can be a molded plastic piece or other non-conductive material anchored to the speaker frame <b>1859</b>, the inner housing <b>1851</b>, or other component to produce the force of the foot <b>1806</b> pressing the flex <b>1804</b> against the inner housing as shown.

The button spring <b>1810</b>, and specifically the spring arms <b>1812</b>, can be formed of conductive material, including metal, and shaped so as to provide an upward biasing force against the button <b>1808</b>. The button spring <b>1810</b> can include a lower portion <b>1814</b> anchored to the speaker housing <b>1859</b> or other component of the device <b>1800</b> relative to which the button <b>1808</b> travels when depressed. In at least one example, the button spring <b>1810</b> provides a constant force to maintain an upper/outer surface of the button <b>1808</b> flush with an outer surface of the housing <b>1802</b> of the device <b>1800</b> (not shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>20</b>H</figref> but shown in at least <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>20</b>A and <b>20</b>B</figref>).

<p id="p-0206" num="0195">Referring briefly to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>20</b>A</figref>, when the button <b>1808</b> is not depressed, an electrical grounding path can be formed through one or more screws <b>1816</b> contacting a portion of the housing <b>1802</b>. Accordingly, the screws <b>1816</b> and the housing <b>1802</b> can be formed of electrically conductive materials. The screws <b>1816</b> can act as a stop feature or datum contacting an inner surface of the housing <b>1802</b> to prevent the button <b>1808</b> from extending beyond the housing <b>1802</b> and maintaining a flush external surface with the housing <b>1802</b>. Referring again to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>20</b>H</figref>, when the button <b>1808</b> is partially depressed, the screws <b>1816</b> separate from the housing <b>1802</b> but the plunger <b>1837</b>, which is also in electrical communication with the button <b>1808</b>, is not yet in electrical contact with the tac switch <b>1823</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0207" num="0196">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>20</b>I</figref>, in this partially depressed position of the button <b>1808</b>, the button spring <b>1810</b> can form an electrical grounding pathway between a grounding component or plane of the device <b>1800</b> and the button.

The lower portion <b>1814</b> of the button spring <b>1810</b> can electrically contact or couple to a collar <b>1818</b>, which can be coupled to ground, or one or more other components forming the grounding pathway. The spring arms <b>1812</b> can contact the button <b>1808</b> as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>20</b>H</figref> to complete the pathway to the button <b>1808</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0208" num="0197">In at least one example, the lower portion <b>1814</b> of the button spring <b>1810</b> defines an aperture <b>1820</b> through which the plunger <b>1837</b> extends. In at least one example, the lower portion <b>1814</b> of the button spring <b>1810</b> forms a bend <b>1822</b> that biases portions of the button spring <b>1810</b> on either side of the bend <b>1822</b> away from each other, contributing to the upward force from the button spring <b>1810</b>. For example, the bend <b>1822</b> can bias a first portion <b>1824</b> on one side of the bend <b>1822</b> away from a second portion <b>1826</b> on the other side of the bend <b>1822</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0209" num="0198">In at least one example, the first portion <b>1824</b> contacts or extends into the housing <b>1802</b> at <b>1828</b> to complete an electrical pathway from the button <b>1808</b>, through the button spring <b>1810</b>, to the housing <b>1802</b>. In addition, in at least one example, a collar <b>1818</b> defines an aperture <b>1830</b> and an anti-rotation feature or extension <b>1832</b> of the second portion <b>1826</b> can extend through the aperture <b>1830</b> or at least partially into the aperture <b>1830</b> to prevent the button spring <b>1810</b> from rotating out of position as the button <b>1808</b> is depressed and travels up and down during use. In at least one example, the anti-rotation feature <b>1832</b> engages the collar <b>1818</b> without adhesives. In general, the button spring can be disposed and fixed in position as shown without adhesives. The area or volume in which the button spring <b>1810</b> is disposed can include an area between the inner housing <b>1851</b> and the outer housing <b>1802</b> such that any adhesives present could be exposed to chemical aggressors from the external environment, for example through the various vents defined by the housing, including first and second vents <b>1849</b> and <b>1847</b>, respectively. Thus, the button spring <b>1810</b> can be fixed in position via the anti-rotation feature <b>1832</b>, an interface with the housing <b>1802</b> at <b>1828</b>, and/or with the button <b>1808</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0210" num="0199">In at least one example, the device <b>1800</b> can include a shim <b>1834</b> disposed between the button <b>1808</b> or the button cap and the plunger <b>1837</b>.

<p id="p-0211" num="0200">Referring back to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>20</b>H</figref>, the device <b>1800</b> can include speaker meshes <b>1836</b><i>a</i>, <b>1836</b><i>b </i>disposed over speakers <b>1863</b>, <b>1861</b>, respectively. Each screw <b>1816</b> of the button <b>1808</b> can include a lower surface <b>1838</b> of the screw head facing the mesh <b>1836</b><i>a</i>-<i>b</i>. The lower surface <b>1838</b> can be chamfered. The meshes <b>1836</b><i>a</i>-<i>b </i>can be recessed to match or accommodate the curvature of the lower surfaces <b>1838</b> of the screws <b>1816</b>. The recessed geometry of the meshes <b>1836</b><i>a</i>-<i>b </i>can provide extra space or volume into which the screws <b>1816</b> can extend toward the meshes <b>1836</b> without the screws <b>1816</b> and meshes <b>1836</b><i>a</i>-<i>b </i>contacting or colliding when the button <b>1808</b> is depressed. Additionally, the speaker meshes <b>1836</b><i>a</i>, <b>1836</b><i>b </i>can include any number of stacked meshes of varying pore size and material. Pore size can be identified and selected to balance the resistance to ingress of foreign materials, cosmetic benefits, water ejection, and acoustic performance. In some examples, the speaker meshes can both be metal and be welded to the device <b>1800</b>.

<p id="p-0213" num="0202"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>20</b>J</figref> shows a cross-sectional view of a portion of a device <b>1800</b>, including a button <b>1808</b> disposed in an aperture <b>1833</b> defined by a housing <b>1802</b> and a speaker diaphragm <b>1836</b> disposed in an internal volume of the device <b>1800</b>. The speaker diaphragm <b>1836</b>, the button <b>1808</b>, and the housing <b>1802</b> can define the front volume <b>1855</b>, which is also shown and labeled in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>20</b>A</figref>. In at least one example, the device <b>1800</b> can include an acoustic gasket <b>1840</b> extending between the button <b>1808</b> and the housing <b>1802</b>. In at least one example, the gasket <b>1840</b> is greater than or equal to about 100 microns thick where the gasket <b>1840</b> contacts the housing <b>1802</b>. In at least one example, an upper surface of the gasket <b>1840</b> interfaces at an angle with the vertical surface of the housing <b>1802</b> defining the aperture <b>1833</b> at greater than 0-degrees, for example at least about 20-degrees or more relative to the horizontal plane orthogonal to the surface of the housing <b>1802</b> defining the aperture <b>1833</b>. In at least one example, the gasket includes an elastic material. In at least one example, the gasket <b>1840</b> includes a material with a Shore-A hardness of between about 30 A and 90 A, or between about 40 A and 80 A, or between about 50 A and 70 A, for example about 60 A.</p>
<p id="p-0214" num="0203">Accordingly, with a gasket <b>1840</b> having the above-noted dimensions and material properties, the gasket <b>1840</b> can maintain and rebound to its resting shape after the button <b>1808</b> is depressed by the user. In addition, according to the above-noted dimensions and material properties, the gasket <b>1840</b> can seal the front volume <b>1855</b> such that pressure can build up greater than an atmospheric pressure external to the device <b>1800</b>. In this way, the volume of the first speaker <b>1863</b> can be increased. In at least one example, the material properties, shape, and dimensions of the gasket <b>1840</b> can be tuned to maximize at least one of the resonant frequencies of the first speaker <b>1863</b>. In at least one example, the gasket <b>1840</b> can be permeable to water but impermeable to dust and debris from the external environment.</p>
<p id="p-0215" num="0204">The first speaker <b>1863</b> can include two peak resonance frequencies, a mechanical resonant frequency generated by shape of the first speaker <b>1863</b> itself operating in open air and front port resonance leveraging the length of the first vent <b>1849</b> as a tube that creates a higher pitch frequency and lets sound out from the first speaker <b>1863</b> through the housing <b>1802</b>. The pressure built up in the front volume <b>1855</b>, in part due to the seal formed by the gasket <b>1840</b>, affects the pressure waves of sound from the first speaker <b>1863</b> exiting the first vent <b>1849</b>. In this way, the gasket <b>1840</b> can tune the sound from the first speaker <b>1863</b> and increase the resonant tube frequency. In this way, multiple resonant frequencies (mechanical and tube) can be utilized and a broader range of sound frequencies can be increased.</p>

<p id="p-0217" num="0206"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>20</b>K</figref> illustrates a cross-sectional view of a portion of a device <b>1800</b> including a button <b>1808</b>, a housing <b>1802</b>, and a gasket <b>1840</b> extending between the housing <b>1802</b> and the button <b>1808</b>. The button <b>1808</b> can include an exterior color layer <b>1842</b> that can be formed by physical vapor deposition. The color layer <b>1842</b> can also be referred to as a PVD layer <b>1842</b>. The PVD layer can extend over a first surface <b>1844</b> angled or curved at a first angle or curvature and a second surface <b>1848</b> angled at a second angle different than the angle of the first surface <b>1844</b>. During the PVD process of forming the PVD layer <b>1842</b>, the PVD layer <b>1842</b> can be deposited onto the button <b>1808</b> in a constant direction regardless of the curvature, angles, or portion of the surface being deposited, in order to simplify the PVD process. In one example, the direction of deposition is indicated by the deposition direction <b>1850</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0218" num="0207">Because the first angle of the first surface <b>1844</b> is different than the second angle of the second surface <b>1848</b>, relative to the deposition direction <b>1850</b>, the PVD layer <b>1842</b> deposited on the first surface <b>1844</b> is formed thicker than the PVD layer <b>1842</b> of the second surface <b>1848</b>. This can be due to the steeper angle of the second surface <b>1848</b> relative to the horizontal plane of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>20</b>K</figref> orthogonal to the deposition direction <b>1850</b>. As shown, the PVD layer <b>1842</b> of the second surface <b>1848</b> is thinner than the PVD layer <b>1842</b> of the first surface <b>1844</b> due to this difference in angle relative to the deposition direction <b>1850</b>. The thickness of the PVD layer <b>1842</b> affects the color of the PVD layer <b>1842</b>. In one example, the thicker PVD layer <b>1842</b> at the first surface <b>1844</b> can appear red while the color of the PVD layer <b>1842</b> at a transition or corner surface <b>1846</b> between the first and second surfaces <b>1844</b>, <b>1848</b> can appear blue and the color of the thinner PVD layer <b>1842</b> of the second surface <b>1848</b> can shift back toward red, for example appearing orange or red-orange. The thickness of the PVD layer <b>1842</b> at the corner <b>1846</b> can be thicker than the PVD layer <b>1842</b> at the second surface <b>1848</b> but thinner than the PVD layer <b>1842</b> at the first surface <b>1844</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0219" num="0208">In the example noted above, the blue color of the PVD layer <b>1842</b> at the corner <b>1846</b> stands out more visually compared to the red color of the PVD layer <b>1842</b> at the first surface <b>1844</b> than the orange color of the PVD layer <b>1842</b> at the second surface <b>1848</b>. In order to minimize the contrast of the blue and red between the corner <b>1846</b> and the first surface <b>1844</b>, the corner <b>1846</b> can include a small radius of curvature to minimize the area of the surface of the button <b>1808</b> defined by the corner <b>1846</b>. While the PVD layer <b>1842</b> at the second surface <b>1848</b> is thinner than the PVD layer <b>1842</b> at the corner <b>1846</b>, the orange color of the PVD layer <b>1842</b> at the second surface <b>1848</b> is closer to red and visually less contrasting or noticeable. Thus, the angle of the second surface <b>1848</b> can be chosen to tune the thickness of the PVD layer <b>1842</b> on the second surface <b>1848</b> relative to the thickness of the PVD layer <b>1842</b> of the first surface <b>1842</b> in order to minimize the color difference.</p>
<p id="p-0220" num="0209">In at least one example, the second surface <b>1848</b> is angled between about 1-degree and 10-degrees relative to the deposition direction <b>1850</b>, or between about 3-degrees and about 7-degrees relative to the deposition direction <b>1850</b>, for example at about 5-degrees relative to the deposition angle <b>1850</b>. In this way, the thickness of the PVD layer <b>1842</b> at the second surface <b>1848</b> can be less than about 50% of the thickness or less than the thickness of the PVD layer <b>1842</b> of the first surface <b>1844</b>. In examples where the PVD layer <b>1842</b> at the second surface <b>1848</b> is less than about 50% of the thickness of the PVD layer <b>1842</b> at the first surface, the color difference between the PVD layer <b>1842</b> of the first and second surfaces <b>1844</b>, <b>1848</b> can be visually minimized.</p>

<p id="p-0224" num="0213">As noted above, the wearable electronic devices described herein can be configured to be used during any daily activity of the user. Often, the wearable device will rub against other objects, including clothing, or be subjected to wind if outside during use. Typically, these types of interactions, including rubbing, scratching, and wind blowing can cause negatively affect the performance of one or more microphones of the device. For example, some wearable devices can include a microphone to receive the user's voice during a cellular call using the device. However, often when speaking in an outside environment where wind is present, the wind can cause unwanted noised as it passed over the device and specifically as it passed over one or more microphone apertures in the housing of the device, which can create unwanted background noise and unclear voice transmission from the device.</p>
<p id="p-0225" num="0214">For example, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>22</b></figref>, a user is wearing a wearable electronic watch <b>1900</b> on his/her wrist while riding a bicycle. Such an activity causes wind to pass over and contact the device <b>1900</b>. The same may be true while walking, jogging, hiking, or any other active and/or outdoor activity. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>23</b></figref> shows the device <b>1900</b> subject to wind flowing toward and around the device <b>1900</b>. Flow lines <b>1919</b> illustrate one possible flow path of wind crossing over the device <b>1900</b>. In some examples, turbulent currents <b>1921</b> can be created at one or more sides of the device <b>1900</b>. Such wind and turbulent flow can travel over certain components or opening to microphones and speakers of the device <b>1900</b> and cause unwanted noise when transmitting the user's voice during a cellular call or while recording his or her voice with the device <b>1900</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0226" num="0215">The extent of such noise interference from wind can vary depending on the location of the microphone and the direction of the wind. As noted above, the principles discussed with respect to wind interference can also be true for other types of interference such as water and moisture interference and rubbing or scratching the device <b>1900</b> against other objects such as clothes. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>24</b></figref> shows wind <b>1919</b> coming from various different directions all around the device <b>1900</b>. The locations <b>1917</b><i>a</i>, <b>1917</b><i>b</i>, <b>1917</b><i>c</i>, and <b>1917</b><i>d </i>on the device <b>1900</b> illustrate potential locations of a microphone of the device <b>1900</b>. Again, the extent of noise interference from wind can vary depending on the location of the microphone and the direction of the wind and those directions and locations can vary from one moment to another during use.</p>
<p id="p-0227" num="0216">In order to reduce the interference from wind and other objects, wearable electronic devices of the present systems and methods can include three microphones disposed in the internal volume of the device and configured to receive sound through three respective apertures, The location and orientation of the apertures and microphones can be such that while one or two of the microphones may pick up wind interference during use, at least one of the microphones and apertures will be positioned and oriented to pick up less interference noise. In such a configuration, the device can be configured to process the combined noise detected by all three microphones to reduce the noise. In one example, the device can be configured to rely more heavily on microphones picking up less interference noise such that the detected noise is clear and un-affected by the interference noise caused by the wind.</p>

<p id="p-0245" num="0234"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>29</b>A</figref> shows a bottom elevation view of an example of a back cover <b>1114</b> and an electromagnetically transparent component <b>1116</b> assembled together to form the back side or back surface of a device <b>1100</b>. In at least one example, the back cover <b>1114</b> can be secured to the sidewalls <b>1128</b> of the device <b>1100</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0246" num="0235">In at least one example, the back cover <b>1114</b> can be secured to the sidewalls <b>1128</b> using one or more fasteners <b>1192</b>. In the illustrated example of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>29</b>A</figref>, four fasteners <b>1192</b> are used to secure the back cover <b>1114</b> to the sidewalls <b>1128</b>, with one fastener <b>1192</b> disposed at each corner of the device <b>1100</b>. Using the fasteners shown, the back cover <b>1114</b>, which in some examples can be made of ceramic, glass, or other brittle material, the back cover <b>1114</b> can be secured to the sidewalls <b>1128</b> without cracking, separating from the sidewalls <b>1128</b>, or otherwise being damaged during assembly.</p>
<p id="p-0247" num="0236">In at least one example, the back cover <b>1114</b> can include zirconia, or other brittle material, which is hard to CNC and machine to form intricate connection features. Using the fasteners shown in the figures to secure the back cover <b>1114</b> to the sidewalls <b>1128</b> of the device <b>1100</b> can simplify the geometry of the back cover <b>1114</b> in order to simplify the manufacturing process thereof. For example, as shown in the cross-sectional view of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>15</b>B</figref>, the back cover <b>1114</b> can be formed of a simple geometry extending around the electromagnetically transparent component <b>1116</b> and defining a through hole <b>1194</b> for each fastener <b>1192</b> to pass through.</p>
<p id="p-0248" num="0237">In at least one example, each fastener <b>1192</b> can be disposed through the back cover <b>1114</b> a certain distance away from an outer peripheral edge of the back cover <b>1114</b> such that enough material is present between the fastener <b>1192</b> and the outer peripheral edge of the back cover <b>1114</b> to prevent cracking of the back cover between the fastener and the outer edge. This distance is also designed to reduce any stress concentrations in the back cover <b>1114</b> during and after assembly as the fastener <b>1192</b> presses the material of the back cover <b>1114</b> against the sidewalls <b>1128</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0249" num="0238">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>30</b> and <b>31</b></figref>, in at least one example, the through hole <b>1194</b> defined by the back cover <b>1114</b> can include a counter bore in which the head <b>1196</b> of the fastener <b>1192</b> is disposed when assembled. In addition, in at least one example, the head <b>1196</b> of the fastener <b>1192</b> can include an outwardly extend flange <b>1198</b> with a gasket <b>1199</b> pressed between the flange <b>1198</b> and the back cover <b>1114</b>. In one example, the fastener <b>1192</b> can include a threaded screw. When assembled, the threaded screw can be threaded into a threaded receiving hole defined by the sidewalls <b>1128</b> such that the head <b>1196</b> of the fastener <b>1192</b> presses the back cover <b>1114</b> against the sidewalls <b>1128</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0250" num="0239">The flange <b>1198</b> thus presses against the gasket <b>1199</b> forming an environmental seal against external moisture and other debris from entering the through hole <b>1194</b>. This environmental seal can also reduce corrosion of the fastener itself as it prevent water or other moisture/fluid from entering the through hole <b>1194</b> and coming into contact with the fastener <b>1192</b> disposed inside the through hole <b>1194</b>. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>31</b></figref> shows an O-ring seal <b>1197</b> instead of the gasket shown in the example of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>30</b></figref>, and <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>32</b></figref> shows a side view of the fastener <b>1192</b> with the gasket <b>1199</b> disposed underneath the flange <b>1198</b>.</p>

The angles and depth dimensions shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>37</b></figref> and described herein are exemplary only and can vary to form features of different sizes, shapes, number, and depth. In general, the depth and angle of the features can be iteratively widened and deepened as described until the desired depth and angle of each feature is accomplished.</p>
<p id="p-0256" num="0245">Any of the features, components, and/or parts, including the arrangements and configurations thereof shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>33</b>A-<b>37</b></figref> can be included, either alone or in any combination, in any of the other examples of devices, features, components, and parts shown in the other figures.

<p id="p-0257" num="0246">Wearable electronic devices currently on the market, including current wearable electronic watches, cannot accurately detect environmental pressures in both submerged environments and above water. Usually, this is because the scale of pressures is so different between air pressure above water and fluid pressure below water. It can be especially difficult to configure a single pressure sensor into such a device that is sensitive enough to detect changes in air pressure above water but robust enough to detect pressure changes under water, for example up to 10-bar under water.</p>
<p id="p-0258" num="0247">However, devices of the present disclosure, including the wearable electronic devices and watches described herein, can include a single pressure sensor to detect pressure above water and below water up to 10-bar. In at least one example, the pressure sensor can be electrically connected to an ASIC switch and associated circuitry and processors to switch pressure scales when high pressures are detected when the device is submerged under water.</p>
<p id="p-0259" num="0248">For example, such an ASIC circuitry connected to the sensor can include a low gain mode that measures depth and a high gain mode that measures depth and elevation. This change in gain can be switched with the ASIC to tune the sensor between water and air sensitivities. The processor of the device can also receive temperature measurement from a temperature sensor of the device to take into account the temperature of the external environment, which can affect the pressure sensor reading and sensitivity. Along these lines, at least one example of such a device can also include a heater to apply heat to the pressure sensor in order to perform a health check on the sensor to calibrate the sensor to its original calibration that was performed or set at the same temperature to which it is heated by the heater.</p>
<p id="p-0260" num="0249">To the extent applicable to the present technology, gathering and use of data available from various sources can be used to improve the delivery to users of invitational content or any other content that may be of interest to them. The present disclosure contemplates that in some instances, this gathered data may include personal information data that uniquely identifies or can be used to contact or locate a specific person. Such personal information data can include demographic data, location-based data, telephone numbers, email addresses, TWITTER&#xae; ID's, home addresses, data or records relating to a user's health or level of fitness (e.g., vital signs measurements, medication information, exercise information), date of birth, or any other identifying or personal information.</p>
<p id="p-0261" num="0250">The present disclosure recognizes that the use of such personal information data, in the present technology, can be used to the benefit of users. For example, the personal information data can be used to deliver targeted content that is of greater interest to the user. Accordingly, use of such personal information data enables users to calculated control of the delivered content. Further, other uses for personal information data that benefit the user are also contemplated by the present disclosure. For instance, health and fitness data may be used to provide insights into a user's general wellness, or may be used as positive feedback to individuals using technology to pursue wellness goals.</p>
<p id="p-0262" num="0251">The present disclosure contemplates that the entities responsible for the collection, analysis, disclosure, transfer, storage, or other use of such personal information data will comply with well-established privacy policies and/or privacy practices. In particular, such entities should implement and consistently use privacy policies and practices that are generally recognized as meeting or exceeding industry or governmental requirements for maintaining personal information data private and secure. Such policies should be easily accessible by users, and should be updated as the collection and/or use of data changes. Personal information from users should be collected for legitimate and reasonable uses of the entity and not shared or sold outside of those legitimate uses. Further, such collection/sharing should occur after receiving the informed consent of the users. Additionally, such entities should consider taking any needed steps for safeguarding and securing access to such personal information data and ensuring that others with access to the personal information data adhere to their privacy policies and procedures. Further, such entities can subject themselves to evaluation by third parties to certify their adherence to widely accepted privacy policies and practices. In addition, policies and practices should be adapted for the particular types of personal information data being collected and/or accessed and adapted to applicable laws and standards, including jurisdiction-specific considerations. For instance, in the US, collection of or access to certain health data may be governed by federal and/or state laws, such as the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA); whereas health data in other countries may be subject to other regulations and policies and should be handled accordingly. Hence different privacy practices should be maintained for different personal data types in each country.</p>
<p id="p-0263" num="0252">Despite the foregoing, the present disclosure also contemplates embodiments in which users selectively block the use of, or access to, personal information data. That is, the present disclosure contemplates that hardware and/or software elements can be provided to prevent or block access to such personal information data. For example, in the case of advertisement delivery services, the present technology can be configured to allow users to select to &#x201c;opt in&#x201d; or &#x201c;opt out&#x201d; of participation in the collection of personal information data during registration for services or anytime thereafter. In another example, users can select not to provide mood-associated data for targeted content delivery services. In yet another example, users can select to limit the length of time mood-associated data is maintained or entirely prohibit the development of a baseline mood profile. In addition to providing &#x201c;opt in&#x201d; and &#x201c;opt out&#x201d; options, the present disclosure contemplates providing notifications relating to the access or use of personal information. For instance, a user may be notified upon downloading an app that their personal information data will be accessed and then reminded again just before personal information data is accessed by the app.</p>
<p id="p-0264" num="0253">Moreover, it is the intent of the present disclosure that personal information data should be managed and handled in a way to minimize risks of unintentional or unauthorized access or use. Risk can be minimized by limiting the collection of data and deleting data once it is no longer needed. In addition, and when applicable, including in certain health related applications, data de-identification can be used to protect a user's privacy. De-identification may be facilitated, when appropriate, by removing specific identifiers (e.g., date of birth, etc.), controlling the amount or specificity of data stored (e.g., collecting location data a city level rather than at an address level), controlling how data is stored (e.g., aggregating data across users), and/or other methods.</p>
<p id="p-0265" num="0254">Therefore, although the present disclosure broadly covers use of personal information data to implement one or more various disclosed embodiments, the present disclosure also contemplates that the various embodiments can also be implemented without the need for accessing such personal information data. That is, the various embodiments of the present technology are not rendered inoperable due to the lack of all or a portion of such personal information data. For example, content can be selected and delivered to users by inferring preferences based on non-personal information data or a bare minimum amount of personal information, such as the content being requested by the device associated with a user, other non-personal information available to the content delivery services, or publicly available information.</p>
<p id="p-0266" num="0255">The foregoing description, for purposes of explanation, used specific nomenclature to provide a thorough understanding of the described embodiments. However, it will be apparent to one skilled in the art that the specific details are not required in order to practice the described embodiments. Thus, the foregoing descriptions of the specific embodiments described herein are presented for purposes of illustration and description.
