<heading level="1" id="h-0002">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">Flexible enclosures such as medical patient privacy curtains typically provide access to a patient area for medical professionals or hospital guests by manually sliding the flexible enclosure between an open and closed position. The opening and closing of such enclosures typically involves gripping the curtain and pushing, pulling or otherwise sliding the curtain to further open or close the enclosure. The curtains have surfaces frequently touched by medical professionals or hospital guests, which may be referred to as &#x201c;touch surfaces&#x201d; or &#x201c;contact surfaces&#x201d;, and certain areas of the curtain may naturally be a higher frequency touch surface than other areas of the curtain. Such touch surfaces are often easily contaminated and may represent vectors for contamination that can lead to the spread of disease through contact transference of contamination. For example, Influenza and Covid-19 viruses may be transferred to such touch surfaces, and then transmitted to the next person in contact with the touch surface.</p>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">Patient privacy curtains are cleaned infrequently, touched numerous times at different areas by clinicians and hospital guests, and are contributing to spread of viruses such as Covid-19, superbugs and hospital acquired infections. Typically, there is not handwashing or glove changes in between shutting the curtain and examining the patient, or examining the patient and opening the curtain. It is estimated by the US Center for Disease Control (CDC) that influenza viruses affect 5% to 20% of the U.S population each year, and novel viruses can affect the population at much higher rates. Contamination, such as Covid-19 virus can transfer from a contaminated touch surface and enter one&#x2019;s body when hands that have previously touched an infected surface also touch the mouth, nose, eyes or other vulnerable areas of entry to the body.</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">Thus, there is a need in the art for a device that offers hygienic access to touch surfaces such as patient privacy curtains that is simple to use, easy to clean, and minimizes the spread of virus and contamination of surfaces between uses.</p>

In another embodiment, the attachment element can be magnetic or a hook and loop arrangement. The user handle <b>204</b> is configured to interface with and temporarily engage the curtain attachment <b>202</b> element, allowing the user to manipulate the curtain <b>210</b> via contact with the user handle <b>204</b> only. The corresponding user handle can be a device that is compatible for interfacing with the attachment element for temporarily attaching to it and sliding the curtain open or shut. For example, the user handle can be a hook if the curtain has a ring, mesh, netting, or a buttonhole; or a ring if the curtain has a hook; or a magnetic or hook and loop fastener as appropriate. It will be apparent to those having ordinary skill in the art that other types of interfacing elements known in the art can be utilized for the curtain attachment element or the user handle. The curtain attachment element can be permanently or temporarily/removably attached to the curtain.</p>
<p id="p-0025" num="0024">With reference now to the system <b>250</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b>B</figref>, according to one embodiment, the curtain attachment element <b>252</b> assumes the shape of a handle <b>254</b>, and the user handle is a sleeve <b>256</b> that is configured to cover the handle-shaped curtain attachment element <b>252</b> for grasping and opening or closing the curtain <b>260</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0026" num="0025">In one embodiment, hooks (e.g. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b>A</figref>) can be used to avoid handle contamination. In one embodiment, the hooks are used with an existing handle having a closed structure or figure. In one embodiment, the handle can have a rectangular, circular, square or any other suitable shape. In one embodiment, the hook can engage the closed structure and be pulled back by a user to open a flexible enclosure without risk of getting infected by a virus already on the surface of the handle.</p>
<p id="p-0027" num="0026">In one embodiment, the hook may be disposable after single use. In one embodiment, the hook can be personalized to each user, so that every user can use their own hook to open a flexible enclosure, without risking cross-contamination. In one embodiment, the hook is able to be sterilized or autoclaved between uses.</p>
<p id="p-0028" num="0027">In one embodiment, the hook may be made from any material such as metals, plastics, polymers and combinations thereof. In one embodiment, the material can be stiff to allow engaging with the handle without losing the hook shape.</p>
<p id="p-0029" num="0028">In one aspect, a sanitary and elasticized sleeve is provided (e.g. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b>B</figref>) for use with an existing handle on a flexible enclosure. In one embodiment, the sleeves include an elasticized and compressible/flattenable body having a substantially three-dimensional shape conforming to the shape of a handle with an inner face, an outer face, and an open inserting end. In one embodiment, the body of the sleeves defines a substantially rubberized or plasticized material. In one embodiment, the sleeves are opaque or transparent. In one embodiment, the sleeves may be elastically stretched so as to apply around the configuration of the handle. In one embodiment, the sleeves are capable of being applied to any of a plurality of differently configured handles (knobs, levers, etc.). Alternatively, embodiments of the sleeves can be packaged in pluralities of differing sizes to accommodate the different types and sizes of handles.</p>
<p id="p-0030" num="0029">In one embodiment, the inner face of the sleeve may be covered with disinfecting material. The particular use of the disinfecting material is intended to kill off as many germs as possible adhering to the exposed surfaces of the handle and in attempt to provide the maximum degree of protection to the user.</p>
<p id="p-0031" num="0030">In one embodiment, the sleeves are flat sheets in convenient sizes for coverage of commonly shared surfaces areas. In one embodiment, the sleeves are produced as rolls in sizes which allow a single person to easily hold and tear off individual sections for a cover of desired size and as flat sheets in convenient sizes for coverage of handles. The self-adhesive on the one side of the sleeve&#x2019;s affixes to any surface quickly without excessive handling. The removable adhesive also allows the sleeve to be easily removed from the surface it covers in one piece when users have finished with the use of the equipment.</p>
<p id="p-0032" num="0031">In one embodiment, plurality of the sleeves may be carried within a suitable dispensing device and to then apply each of the sleeves to each of a succeeding plurality of individual handles, such as is typical in public places. The simplicity of the sleeves of the present invention is further such that they may be disposable after every use. In one embodiment, the dispensing device can be attached to the flexible enclosure device for ease of use. In one embodiment, the dispensing device can be placed near the flexible enclosure device.</p>
<p id="p-0033" num="0032">In one embodiment, the handle is permanently attached to the flexible enclosure. In one embodiment, the handle is easily attached and removed from the flexible enclosure device so as to enable removal of the flexible enclosure device for laundering or replacement or the like. Embodiments can be used for any type of facility, and can be adapted for high frequency touch surfaces for restrooms, changing rooms and the like.</p>
