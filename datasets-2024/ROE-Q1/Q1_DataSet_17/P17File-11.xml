<heading level="1" id="h-0001">FIELD OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0002" num="0001">The present invention relates to the field of shoes with a heel which is adjustable in height. In particular, the invention relates to a height adjustable heel of a women&#x2019;s shoe, and more particularly to a women&#x2019;s shoe of the non-sports type.</p>
<heading level="1" id="h-0002">BACKGROUND ART</heading>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">Women&#x2019;s shoes are often provided with a heel. Generally, the height of the heel cannot be modified.</p>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">Certain manufacturers have proposed shoes with a removable and interchangeable heel, in which the heel may be removed and replaced with another heel of a different height.</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">However, this solution is not very practical, in particular because there is a need to have replacement heels available.</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">Thus, a shoe in which the heel is foldable has also been proposed, in particular in which the heel may be rotated and accommodated in a seat obtained in the sole. To date, the need is felt for a heel configured so that the height thereof may be adjusted in an easier and safer manner and adapted to have at least two or at least three different heights.</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">A problem occurring when the heel height of a shoe is modified is the disadvantageous variation of the ergonomics of the shoe caused by the variation in the height of the heel.</p>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">Indeed, the ergonomics of shoes is optimized only for one heel height.</p>
<p id="p-0009" num="0008">Thus, if the heel height in a shoe is varied, the ergonomics of the shoe is no longer optimal.</p>
<p id="p-0010" num="0009">In particular, by varying the height of the heel, an undesired raising of the tip of the shoe occurs which, in addition to being unaesthetic, negatively affects the ergonomics of the shoe.</p>
<p id="p-0011" num="0010">Therefore, the need is also felt for a shoe provided with a heel which is height adjustable in an easy and safe manner, which in particular also allows maintaining the ergonomics at all the possible heights of the heel.</p>
<heading level="1" id="h-0003">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0012" num="0011">It is an object of the present invention to provide a heel of a shoe, in particular a women&#x2019;s shoe, the height of which is adjustable in an easy and safe manner.</p>
<p id="p-0013" num="0012">In particular, in this context, a heel adapted to have at least two or at least three different heights is to be made.</p>
<p id="p-0014" num="0013">It is another object of the present invention to provide a shoe with a height adjustable heel, which is ergonomic at all heights of the heel.</p>
<p id="p-0015" num="0014">The present invention achieves at least one of such objects, and other objects which will become apparent in light of the present description, by means of a shoe heel which is height adjustable so as to have at least two positions, to which a respective height of the heel corresponds, at which it may be locked; the heel comprising:
<ul id="ul0001" list-style="none">
<li id="ul0001-0001" num="0015">a hollow body adapted to be fastened to the sole of the shoe, provided with grooves arranged at different heights from one another;</li>
<li id="ul0001-0002" num="0016">a group of components at least partially inserted into the hollow body, the group of components and the hollow body being adapted to mutually slide; said group of components comprising</li>
<li id="ul0001-0003" num="0017">a lever;</li>
<li id="ul0001-0004" num="0018">a button connected to the lever, adapted to cause a rotation of the lever;</li>
<li id="ul0001-0005" num="0019">at least one locking element connected to the lever so as to switch from a locked position, in which said at least one locking element is inserted into a groove of the hollow body, whereby the group of components and the hollow body are mutually locked in position, to a sliding position, in which the group of components and the hollow body can mutually slide;</li>
<li id="ul0001-0006" num="0020">elastic means arranged so as to exert a force which brings said at least one locking element from the sliding position to the locked position.</li>
</ul>
</p>
<p id="p-0016" num="0021">The heel proposed provides the possibility of easily and quickly adjusting the height thereof. Moreover, the heel is particularly safe because it allows maintaining the desired height when the shoe is worn.</p>
<p id="p-0017" num="0022">The heel may be curved or straight in all embodiments. However, the curved configuration is preferred because it allows obtaining improved ergonomics of the shoe.</p>
<p id="p-0018" num="0023">Preferably, in all embodiments the heel may be height adjusted so as to have at least three positions, e.g. three positions, at which it can be locked, to which a respective heel height corresponds.</p>
<p id="p-0019" num="0024">The invention also relates to a shoe according to claims 9 and 10.</p>
<p id="p-0020" num="0025">Preferably and advantageously, the sole of the shoe comprises a rear zone, to which the heel is restrained, and a front zone, between which there is a zone adapted to be deformed when the heel switches from a first position to a second position of said at least two positions, and vice versa;</p>
<p id="p-0021" num="0026">whereby the relative orientation between the rear zone and the front zone may vary according to the height of the heel.</p>
<p id="p-0022" num="0027">In this case, the relative orientation or inclination between the rear zone and the front zone varies according to the height of the heel, in particular when the base of the heel is in contact with the ground.</p>
<p id="p-0023" num="0028">Therefore, the sole adapts according to the height of the heel, thus allowing the ergonomics of the shoe to be maintained, at any height of the heel.</p>
<p id="p-0024" num="0029">The aforesaid zone allows varying the relative inclination between the rear zone and the front zone according to the height of the heel.</p>
<p id="p-0025" num="0030">Indeed, the aforesaid zone is deformable, in particular reversibly deformable, more specifically it is flexible.</p>
<p id="p-0026" num="0031">Therefore, the undesired raising of the front zone, in particular of the tip of the shoe, advantageously is avoided.</p>
<p id="p-0027" num="0032">Further features and advantages of the invention will become more apparent in light of the detailed description of non-exclusive embodiments.</p>
<p id="p-0028" num="0033">The dependent claims describe particular embodiments of the invention.</p>

<p id="p-0100" num="0111">To vary the height of heel <b>1</b>, the user may exert a force on button <b>104</b> so as to cause a rotation of lever <b>103</b>. The rotation of lever <b>103</b> causes a movement of the two locking elements <b>106</b>, <b>107</b> in mutually opposite direction, in particular in a direction approaching each other. Both locking elements <b>106</b>, <b>107</b> move towards the inside of heel <b>1</b>, thus becoming disengaged from the respective groove. The group <b>102</b> of components and the hollow body <b>101</b> thus may mutually slide. The user may position the locking elements <b>106</b>, <b>107</b> at the pair of grooves <b>121</b><i>a</i>, <b>121</b><i>b</i>, <b>122</b><i>a</i>, <b>122</b><i>b</i>, <b>123</b><i>a</i>, <b>123</b><i>b</i> corresponding to the desired height h1, h2, h3 for heel <b>1</b>. When button <b>104</b> is released, the locking elements <b>106</b>, <b>107</b> move towards the outside under the effect of spring <b>108</b> and are engaged with the pair of grooves, whereby heel <b>1</b> remains at the desired height also when the user wears the shoe, in particular even during walking.</p>
<p id="p-0101" num="0112">As mentioned above, the invention also relates to a shoe comprising a heel <b>1</b> and a sole <b>2</b>, which are restrained to each other.</p>
<p id="p-0102" num="0113">Sole <b>2</b> comprises a rear zone <b>21</b>, to which heel <b>1</b> is restrained, and a front zone <b>22</b>. Preferably, there is a zone <b>23</b> (which is part of sole <b>2</b>) between the rear zone <b>21</b> and the front zone <b>22</b> which is adapted to be deformed when heel <b>1</b> switches from a first position to a second position of said at least two or at least three positions, and vice versa. In other words, zone <b>23</b> is adapted to be deformed when the height h1, h2, h3 of heel <b>1</b> is varied. In particular, the connection zone <b>23</b> is flexible.</p>
<p id="p-0103" num="0114">Therefore, the relative orientation or inclination between the rear zone <b>21</b> and the front zone <b>22</b> advantageously may vary according to the height h1, h2, h3 of heel <b>1</b>. In particular, the relative orientation or inclination between the rear zone <b>21</b> and the front zone <b>22</b> varies according to the height of heel <b>1</b> when the base <b>111</b> of heel <b>1</b> is in contact with ground S, more specifically when the shoe is worn.</p>
<p id="p-0104" num="0115">In particular, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>, the angle between the rear zone <b>21</b> and the front zone <b>22</b> increases as the height of heel <b>1</b> decreases. In particular, the aforesaid angle is formed between the upper surfaces of the rear zone <b>21</b> and the front zone <b>22</b>. The upper surface of sole <b>2</b>, and therefore of the rear zone <b>21</b> and of the front zone <b>22</b>, is the surface opposite to the surface to which the heel <b>1</b> is fixed.</p>
<p id="p-0105" num="0116">Advantageously, the sole <b>2</b> adapts according to the height of heel <b>1</b>, thus allowing the ergonomics of the shoe to be maintained at any height of heel <b>1</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0106" num="0117">Preferably, the orientation of the front zone <b>22</b>, in particular with respect to ground S, substantially remains the same, independently of the height of heel <b>1</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0107" num="0118">An advantageous aspect is shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>, where the shoe is diagrammatically shown in three different configurations, in particular in which heel <b>1</b> has three different heights h1, h2, h3, with h1&gt;h2&gt;h3.</p>
<p id="p-0108" num="0119">It can be noted that, advantageously, by varying the height of heel <b>1</b>, the relative inclination between the rear zone <b>22</b> and the front zone <b>21</b> is also varied. The orientation of the front zone <b>21</b> preferably does not change with respect to ground S when the height of heel <b>1</b> is changed.</p>
<p id="p-0109" num="0120">Preferably, zone <b>23</b> is proximal to the front end <b>29</b> of sole <b>2</b> and distal from the rear end <b>28</b> of sole <b>2</b>.</p>

Such a distance was selected on the basis of studies on ergonomics. Preferably, zone <b>23</b> is at a distance from 130 to 190 mm from the rear end <b>28</b> of sole <b>2</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0111" num="0122">Said distance is, for example measured from the rear end <b>28</b> of sole <b>2</b> up to the start of zone <b>23</b>, starting from the rear end <b>28</b>, in particular following the curve or outline of sole <b>2</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0112" num="0123">In particular, the overall length of sole <b>2</b> is measured from the rear end <b>28</b> to the front end <b>29</b> of sole <b>2</b>. More specifically, the length of sole <b>2</b> preferably is measured along sole <b>2</b>, i.e. following the outline thereof.</p>
<p id="p-0113" num="0124">Preferably, zone <b>23</b> has a width which is substantially equal to the width of sole <b>2</b>, or in other words, zone <b>23</b> extends from a side edge portion of sole <b>2</b> to the opposite side edge portion.</p>
<p id="p-0114" num="0125">Preferably, zone <b>23</b> has a length, perpendicularly to the width, of at least 0.5 cm or of at least 1 cm, for example from 0.5 to 6 cm, or from 1 to 4 cm, or from 1 to 2 cm. In addition to zone <b>23</b>, sole <b>2</b> may be provided with other deformable zones, in particular flexible zones, for possibly further improving the ergonomics of the shoe. In general, zone <b>23</b> substantially connects the part or front zone <b>22</b> of sole <b>2</b> with the part or rear zone <b>21</b> of sole <b>2</b> and may also be defined connection zone <b>23</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0115" num="0126">Zone <b>23</b> may, for example, be part of the front zone <b>22</b>. In particular, it may be made of the same material of which the front zone <b>22</b> is made. Preferably, the rear zone <b>21</b> is made of a different material as compared to the front zone <b>22</b>, in particular more rigid than the front zone <b>22</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0116" num="0127">In a variant, zone <b>23</b> may optionally be made of a different material as compared to the rear zone <b>21</b> and the front zone <b>22</b>.</p>
