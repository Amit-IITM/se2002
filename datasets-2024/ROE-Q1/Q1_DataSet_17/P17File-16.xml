<heading id="h-0002" level="1">BACKGROUND</heading>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">Deep frying is a common cooking method often used by restaurants and fast food chains as a quick and inexpensive way to prepare foods. Some aspects of these operations may be relatively messy and/or dangerous due to spills, splashes, etc. of a cooking medium such as oil, and as such there is a continuing desire to automate or simplify various aspects of deep frying methods or systems.</p>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">For example, during the process of frying foods such as french fries, chicken, onion rings, etc., kitchen personnel will remove the fryer baskets from the frying medium with the consumable items inside of the basket, to shake the foods before reloading the basket into the frying medium. This process of shaking the basket during the frying process ensures an even, thorough frying of the food and also shakes off excess oil.</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">Additionally, automated devices operating within a cooking environment may move with respect to multiple axes to accomplish a variety of culinary tasks (e.g., flipping burgers, frying tater tots, filling drinks, plating meals, etc.). When frying foods, an automated food processing system may be implemented that, using an automated device (e.g., a robotic arm), moves downward in a food processing area (e.g., the oil contents of a fryer) to grip an attachment extension (e.g., a handle) extending from a first side of a basket, moves upward to lift the basket out of the food processing area, and moves forward to latch one or more attachment hooks, connected to a second side of the basket, to a hanger to allow the food processing container to rest above the food processing area. It will be understood that under normal conditions the automated device latches the one or more attachment hooks of the basket on a hanger of a food processing device (e.g., a deep fryer), where the one or more attachment hooks and the hanger are co-planar with respect to each other. In some examples, due to manufacturing tolerance and/or attrition from frying operation, the attachment extension (e.g., the handle) may experience twist (e.g., a misconfiguration that may include bend, tilt, etc.) relative to the attachment hook(s). This twist may result in a rotation of the one or more attachment hooks' x-z plane about its y-axis, obstructing the hanger plane (e.g., no longer making them co-planar) and, consequently, misaligning the attachment/basket hooks or preventing the automated device from latching the one or more basket hooks onto the hanger of the food processing device. Accordingly, the automated device may drop the food processing container into the food processing area, which halts the automated frying process. Twist of the attachment extension (e.g., the handle) may make basket placement difficult or unreliable. Alternate procedures (e.g., a camera vision system) exist to circumvent orientation issues (e.g., by locating fiducial marker(s) on baskets to perform spatial distance measuring in free space) generated by twist of the attachment extension but are very expensive and commonly require customized add-ons to food processing containers.</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">There is a continued desire to automate the above and other aspects of food preparation, such as for deep frying or other cooking or food processing devices.</p>
<heading id="h-0003" level="1">SUMMARY</heading>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">In at least some example illustrations, a food processing apparatus is provided, comprising a basket retainer configured to support a basket of consumable items above a food processing device. The food processing apparatus may also include a reciprocating agitator configured to impart a repetitive contact to the basket, thereby inducing motion of the consumable items within the basket.</p>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">In at least some examples, the agitator includes one of a rotary motor, a linear actuator, a vibrator, or a pneumatic cylinder.</p>
<p id="p-0009" num="0008">In at least some example illustrations, the agitator comprises a rotary output and a linkage pivotally secured at an end thereof to the rotary output. The linkage may induce the reciprocal motion of the basket retainer via rotation of the rotary output.</p>
<p id="p-0010" num="0009">In at least some examples, the reciprocal motion is along a first direction, and the agitator is configured to induce an additional motion in the basket retainer in a second direction, with the second direction being normal to the first direction.</p>
<p id="p-0011" num="0010">In at least some example illustrations, the reciprocal motion is vertically oriented with respect to the basket retainer.</p>
<p id="p-0012" num="0011">In at least some example approaches, the reciprocal motion is horizontally oriented with respect to the basket retainer.</p>
<p id="p-0013" num="0012">In at least some examples, the basket retainer is configured to retain one of an edge of the basket or a basket handle.</p>
<p id="p-0014" num="0013">In at least some example illustrations, the basket retainer includes one of a hook, a lip, a holding surface, or a support surface.</p>
<p id="p-0015" num="0014">In at least some examples, the agitator comprises a pneumatic cylinder configured to impart repetitive contact to a handle of the basket.</p>
<p id="p-0016" num="0015">In at least some example illustrations, the reciprocal motion is vertically oriented with respect to the basket retainer.</p>
<p id="p-0017" num="0016">In at least some example approaches, the reciprocating agitator reciprocates at a frequency of up to six times per second, or 0-6 Hz.</p>
<p id="p-0018" num="0017">In at least some example approaches, the reciprocating agitator is configured such that the repetitive contact is interspersed with a lack of contact between the reciprocating agitator and the basket.</p>
<p id="p-0019" num="0018">In at least some example illustrations, the food processing device is a fryer.</p>
<p id="p-0020" num="0019">In at least some example approaches, the basket retainer comprises a guide having a base configured to be positioned adjacent a basket mounting position on the food processing apparatus. The basket guide may narrow from the base to an uppermost portion. Opposing guide surfaces of the basket guide may extend from the uppermost portion toward the base and are configured to horizontally align a basket holder with respect to the basket mounting position as the basket holder descends toward the basket mounting position.</p>
<p id="p-0021" num="0020">In at least some examples, the apparatus further includes a manipulator, comprising a first extension defining a first handle opening configured to receive a handle of the basket, and a second extension defining a second handle opening configured to receive the handle. The manipulator may also include a gripper assembly configured to enclose the handle within the first handle opening and the second handle opening. The manipulator may also include a sensor configured to determine a proximity of the handle to the second handle opening. In at least a subset of these examples, the sensor comprises at least one of a beam receiver, an imaging sensor, a position sensor, a pressure sensor, a proximity sensor, a motion sensor.</p>
<p id="p-0022" num="0021">In at least some example illustrations, an automated food processing system is provided, comprising a basket having an attachment extension extending from a first side of the basket, and one or more attachment hooks located at a second side of the basket. The system may further include a robotic arm including a gripping mechanism configured to grip the attachment extension. While the attachment extension is gripped, the robotic arm is configured to move the basket with respect to a food processing device. The food processing device may include a food processing area and a basket retainer above the food processing area. The food processing device may also include a basket guide adjacent the basket retainer. The basket guide may narrow from a base adjacent a basket mounting position on the basket retainer to an uppermost portion. Further, opposing guide surfaces of the basket guide may extend from the uppermost portion toward the base and may be configured to horizontally align the one or more attachment hooks with respect to the basket mounting position as the robotic arm causes the food processing container to descend toward the basket mounting position.</p>
<p id="p-0023" num="0022">In at least some example illustrations of an automated food processing system, the food processing device includes an agitator configured to induce a reciprocal motion of the basket retainer, thereby inducing motion of the basket.</p>
<p id="p-0024" num="0023">In at least some examples, the one or more attachment hooks are disposed at an end of the basket opposite the attachment extension, wherein the one or more attachment hooks define a horizontal opening delimited at opposing sides corresponding to the opposing guide surfaces. In at least a subset of these examples, the horizontal opening is substantially equal to a width of the base.</p>
<p id="p-0025" num="0024">In at least some example approaches, the automated food processing system further comprises a manipulator. The manipulator may include a first extension and a second extension, each having respective handle openings configured to receive a handle of the basket. The manipulator may also include a gripper assembly configured to enclose the handle within the first handle opening and the second handle opening and a sensor configured to determine a proximity of the handle to the second handle opening.</p>

<heading id="h-0005" level="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION</heading>
<p id="p-0039" num="0038">Robotic automated food preparation systems have been developed for automating various kitchen operations of a restaurant. For example, each of U.S. patent application Ser. No. 17/494,664 (filed on Oct. 5, 2021) and U.S. Provisional Patent Application Ser. No. 63/088,162 (filed on Oct. 6, 2020) disclose examples of robotic automated food preparation systems that may be used to fry consumable items such as french fries, onion rings, chicken, etc., and the contents of these applications are hereby incorporated by reference in their entireties.</p>
<p id="p-0040" num="0039">Various aspects of these example robotic automated food preparation systems may be further automated, as described in further detail below. More specifically, in some example approaches, an agitator is provided for shaking or agitating a plurality of consumable or food items, e.g., to encourage even distribution and/or breaking individual items apart within a basket, shake off excess cooking medium, etc. The agitator may reciprocate, thereby imparting a repetitive contact to a basket of consumable items.</p>
<p id="p-0041" num="0040">In other examples, guidance of a robot performing tasks such as moving a basket of consumable or food items may be enhanced using one or more mechanical guides. More specifically, a guide may be employed which catches, engages, or otherwise contacts a corresponding feature of a basket for the consumable/food items. In another example, one or more sensors may be provided to provide an indication that a robot gripper is within a proximity of a basket and/or handle thereof.</p>
<p id="p-0042" num="0041">Turning now to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>, an example illustration of a partial restaurant operation is illustrated. Restaurant operations are generally divided into front-of-house operations and the back-of-house operations such as the illustrated kitchen operation of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>. Front-of-house operations may include entry and waiting areas for customers, ordering queues, employee stations, point of sale (PoS) systems, front-of-house employees (e.g., taking orders, delivering food, cleaning), staging areas for completed orders, dining areas, and other related customer-facing facilities and operations based on particular restaurant design and operations. By contrast, back-of-house operations such as illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref> generally include a number of stages and types of food storage, numerous racks for temporary storage of inventory to be used in food preparation, various types of food preparation equipment and preparation stations for preparing and combining prepared food items, racks for storage of partially prepared and prepared food items, and numerous employees, to handle food items and equipment from inventory.</p>
<p id="p-0043" num="0042">Generally, the system <b>100</b> includes a back-of-house operation or kitchen for a restaurant, which employs a cooking apparatus <b>101</b> and a robotic arm <b>102</b>. The system <b>100</b> may be integrated into any restaurant or kitchen operation. In some example approaches, the system <b>100</b> is integrated into a back-of-house operation of a restaurant, examples of which are described in U.S. patent application Ser. No. 16/780,797 and U.S. Provisional Patent Application Ser. No. 62/819,326, and the contents of each of these applications are hereby expressly incorporated by reference in their entireties.</p>
<p id="p-0044" num="0043">In the example shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>, the system <b>100</b> includes refrigerated ingredient storage <b>104</b><i>a </i>and <b>104</b><i>b</i>, cooking devices <b>106</b><i>a </i>and <b>106</b><i>b</i>, food ingredient finishing areas <b>108</b><i>a</i>, <b>108</b><i>b</i>, refrigerated items <b>109</b>, cooktop <b>112</b>, warming/short-term storage area <b>114</b>, dry food ingredient storage <b>116</b>, and assembly/topping application <b>118</b>. The system <b>100</b> may include any other components or subsystems that are convenient, e.g., freezers or refrigerators, bulk ingredient storage, liquid storage, etc. The back-of-house operations may also include numerous employees and operations that do not directly involve the preparation of food, such as loading areas for receiving inventory, dishwashing and sanitizing stations, storage areas, and offices for administrative employees such as management, accountants, etc.</p>
<p id="p-0045" num="0044">The cooking apparatus <b>101</b> includes a plurality of processing devices for producing food, and in the example illustrated these processing devices include the refrigerated ingredient storages <b>104</b><i>a </i>and <b>104</b><i>b </i>(collectively, <b>104</b>), cooking devices <b>106</b><i>a </i>and <b>106</b><i>b </i>(collectively, <b>106</b>), and food ingredient finishing areas <b>108</b><i>a</i>, <b>108</b><i>b </i>(collectively, <b>108</b>). These processing devices generally represent distinct locations in a process of producing, in this example, fried foods. The robot arm <b>102</b> may be used to move or manipulate food ingredients to and from the processing devices of the cooking apparatus <b>101</b> to produce cooked food(s) for serving. While the examples that follow illustrate the robot arm <b>102</b> in the context of system <b>100</b> and cooking apparatus <b>101</b>, numerous other example approaches will be apparent upon consideration of the present disclosure. Accordingly, implementation of other example systems <b>100</b>, cooking apparatuses <b>101</b>, or robot arms <b>102</b> are not limited to the production of fried foods.</p>
<p id="p-0046" num="0045">The cooking devices <b>106</b> are described herein as deep fat fryers, i.e., employing a volume of cooking medium, e.g., vegetable oil, peanut oil, or the like, which is heated to cook food ingredients. Food ingredients such as cut potatoes, battered onion rings, or the like, may be kept in refrigerated ingredient storage <b>104</b> and delivered to the fryers <b>106</b> and/or finishing areas <b>108</b> by robot arm <b>102</b>. Upon completion of cooking the food ingredients, the robot arm <b>102</b> may move the food ingredients from the fryers <b>106</b> to the finishing areas <b>108</b>. In the finishing areas <b>108</b>, the cooked ingredients may be seasoned or otherwise finished. The finishing areas <b>108</b> may also have heating elements, lamps, or the like to keep the cooked food warm to allow serving on demand. Personnel in the kitchen operation <b>100</b> may collect the cooked food, e.g., in serving containers.</p>
<p id="p-0047" num="0046">The robot arm <b>102</b> may be any robot capable of moving and manipulating food ingredients amongst the processing devices, i.e., the ingredient storage <b>104</b>, cooking devices <b>106</b>, and/or finishing areas <b>108</b>. In the illustrated example seen in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>1</b> and <b>2</b></figref>, the robot arm <b>102</b> includes a plurality of rigid arm members <b>120</b> connected by respective joints <b>122</b>. The robot arm <b>102</b> extends from a base <b>124</b>, which is configured to move along a rail <b>126</b>. The joints <b>122</b> are each configured to facilitate movement of an end effector <b>128</b> of the robot arm <b>102</b> amongst the cooking apparatus <b>101</b>. For example, each of the joints <b>122</b> may be a single or a multi-axis joint allowing relative rotation between adjacent arm members <b>120</b>. The joints <b>122</b> and arm members <b>120</b> cooperate with the sliding base <b>124</b> to provide multi-axis freedom of movement of the end effector <b>128</b> within the cooking apparatus <b>101</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0048" num="0047">Referring now to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref>, the rail <b>126</b> is described in further detail in the context of an example cooking apparatus <b>101</b>, although the rail <b>126</b> may be used with other cooking apparatuses. Generally, the rail <b>126</b> provides a fixed location from which the robot arm <b>102</b> extends and moves an end effector <b>128</b>, e.g., to move food and/or ingredients amongst processing devices or locations of the cooking apparatus <b>101</b>. The rail <b>126</b> includes rollers <b>130</b>, which may facilitate rolling movement of the robot arm <b>102</b> along a floor or ground surface, e.g., away from the cooking apparatus <b>101</b> for cleaning, maintenance, or the like. The rail <b>126</b> also includes lifts <b>132</b> at each end, which generally lift the rail <b>126</b> to prevent movement of the rail <b>126</b> along the ground/floor surface via the rollers <b>130</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0049" num="0048">While the robot arm <b>102</b> is movable via the rail <b>126</b> as noted above, it is desirable to fix a relative position of the rail <b>126</b> of the robot arm <b>102</b> relative to processing devices in the cooking apparatus <b>101</b>, e.g., processing devices <b>104</b>, <b>106</b>, and/or <b>108</b>, while the robot arm <b>102</b> is operating. In this manner, movements of the robot arm <b>102</b> may be controlled to facilitate accurate grasping, manipulation, and delivery of food ingredients within a cooking apparatus. The robot arm <b>102</b> may move amongst the processing devices <b>104</b>, <b>106</b>, and/or <b>108</b> according to a controller, as will be detailed further below. Additionally, it is desirable to allow the robot arm <b>102</b> to be moveable with respect to the processing devices <b>104</b>, <b>106</b>, and/or <b>108</b> to allow cleaning or maintenance of the robot arm <b>102</b> and/or the processing devices.</p>
<p id="p-0050" num="0049">As noted above, in some examples it may be desirable to agitate or shake food or consumable items, e.g., before, during, or after being fried in one of the cooking devices <b>106</b>. Turning now to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>3</b>, <b>4</b>, <b>5</b>A, and <b>5</b>B</figref>, example components systems for agitating or shaking food items are described in further detail.</p>
<p id="p-0051" num="0050">Referring now to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>3</b> and <b>4</b></figref>, an example component system <b>300</b> is illustrated and described in further detail. Generally, system <b>300</b> may include a basket retainer <b>302</b> that is configured to hold a basket <b>304</b> of fried consumable items <b>308</b> therein and a reciprocating agitator <b>306</b> configured to induce a reciprocal or &#x201c;back and forth&#x201d; motion of the basket retainer <b>302</b>. In an example, fried consumable items <b>308</b> are french fries, chicken nuggets or strips, or the like, which are initially submerged in a frying medium, e.g., oil, contained in a vat <b>110</b>. The consumable items <b>308</b> may be removed from the frying medium in vat <b>110</b> and agitated while being held above the vat <b>110</b> and/or frying medium. In example illustrations described herein, an agitator <b>306</b> may be linked with the basket retainer <b>302</b> that may &#x201c;shake,&#x201d; e.g., in a linear or back-and-forth motion, the basket retainer <b>302</b>. Accordingly, motion is imparted to the basket <b>304</b>, which is filled with the consumable items <b>308</b>. In this manner, the consumable items <b>308</b>, initially relatively stuck together as illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref>, may be broken apart or otherwise distributed relatively evenly within the basket <b>304</b> as illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b></figref> to ensure the consumable items <b>308</b> are more evenly fried.</p>
<p id="p-0052" num="0051">As illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>3</b> and <b>4</b></figref>, system <b>300</b> may include a basket retainer <b>302</b>, in which a basket <b>304</b> of fried consumable items <b>308</b> may be held. The basket <b>304</b> may be configured to hold one or more of the consumable items <b>308</b>. Each of the basket retainers <b>302</b> may include one of a hook, a lip, or a holding surface, and may sit atop an existing food processing device <b>106</b><i>a </i>and/or <b>106</b><i>b</i>, e.g., an existing fryer. Accordingly, each basket retainer <b>302</b> may be configured to retain an edge of the basket or a basket handle. As will be described further below, in the example illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>3</b> and <b>4</b></figref> the basket <b>304</b> includes hooks <b>310</b> which are received on the basket retainer <b>302</b>. A basket guide <b>312</b> defined by the basket retainer <b>302</b> protrudes through the hooks <b>310</b>. Accordingly, the basket retainer <b>302</b> retains an end of the basket <b>304</b> that is opposite an end of the basket <b>304</b> having a handle <b>314</b>. The handle <b>314</b> may facilitate grasping of the basket <b>304</b>, e.g., by kitchen personnel and/or a robot or other automated device. With the basket <b>304</b> mounted to the basket retainer <b>302</b>, the basket <b>304</b> may be raised and lowered relative to the vat <b>110</b>, e.g., to submerge consumable items <b>308</b> within a cooking medium and remove consumable items <b>308</b> from the cooking medium. The basket retainer <b>302</b> may be provided on a raising/lowering device of the cooking devices <b>106</b><i>a </i>and/or <b>106</b><i>b</i>, and this raising and/or lowering of the basket <b>304</b> may be automated in any manner that is convenient. Merely by way of examiner, upon a basket <b>304</b> being submerged in the vat <b>110</b> and/or a cooking medium therein, the cooking device <b>106</b><i>a </i>and/or <b>106</b><i>b </i>may automatically raise the basket retainer <b>302</b> after expiration of a desired cooking time, thereby facilitating proper cooking of consumable items <b>308</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0053" num="0052">The agitator <b>306</b> may generally be configured to induce a reciprocal motion of the basket retainer <b>302</b>, and thereby coming into repetitive contact with the basket <b>304</b> and/or the basket retainer <b>302</b>. The reciprocating motion of the agitator <b>306</b> may thereby agitate consumable items <b>308</b> within the basket <b>304</b> while the basket <b>304</b> is held by the basket retainer <b>302</b>. For example, the consumable items <b>308</b>, to any extent they may become stuck together (e.g., as a result of freezing, thawing, cooking, etc.), may impact other consumable items <b>308</b> and/or interior walls of the basket <b>304</b> as a result of the shaking of the basket <b>304</b> caused by the agitator <b>306</b>, thereby breaking apart the consumable items <b>308</b> into smaller and/or individual pieces of the consumable items <b>308</b>. Example agitator(s) <b>306</b> may include a rotary motor, a linear actuator, and/or a vibrator. In the example illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>3</b> and <b>4</b></figref>, the agitator <b>306</b> comprises a motor <b>316</b> configured to induce the reciprocal motion of the basket retainer via a linkage <b>320</b> pivotally secured at an end thereof to a rotary output <b>318</b> of the motor <b>316</b>. More specifically, the motor <b>316</b> may cause the rotary output <b>318</b>, which as illustrated may be circularly or disc-shaped, to rotate about a center axis thereof. Accordingly, the linkage <b>320</b> causes contact block <b>322</b> to impact the basket retainer <b>302</b> or the basket <b>304</b>, thereby shaking or agitating the basket <b>304</b>. The agitator <b>306</b> may induce motion in various ways that are configured to break apart or redistribute consumable items <b>308</b> within the basket <b>304</b> to enhance the degree to which the consumable items <b>308</b> are evenly cooked, e.g., in a frying medium. For example, agitation of the basket retainer <b>302</b> and/or basket <b>304</b> may be performed with variable speeds, with different degrees/distances of motion, or with motion in different directions. In the example illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b></figref>, the reciprocal motion of the basket <b>304</b> is initiated in a first direction, as indicated by first direction arrow <b>324</b>. The agitator <b>306</b> may, in some examples, be additionally configured to induce motion of the basket retainer <b>302</b> and/or basket <b>304</b> in a second direction <b>326</b> different from the first direction <b>324</b>. For example, a linear motion of the basket retainer <b>302</b> may be applied at an angle to the basket <b>304</b> (e.g., by an angled surface of contact block <b>322</b> interfacing with or contacting the basket retainer <b>302</b> and/or basket <b>304</b>), such that the agitating motion has a component in the first direction <b>324</b>, as well as a second direction <b>326</b> normal or orthogonal to the first direction. It should also be noted that while the reciprocal motion illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b></figref> is of a linear nature, this is not limiting and the agitation may be done via a vibration, up-and-down motion, tilting, or any other motion that might serve to enhance agitation of the consumable items.</p>
<p id="p-0054" num="0053">Turning now to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>5</b>A and <b>5</b>B</figref>, another component system <b>500</b> for agitating or shaking basket <b>304</b> is illustrated and described in further detail. As with the examples illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>3</b> and <b>4</b></figref>, the basket <b>304</b> may be positioned upon a basket retainer <b>302</b>. Further, the basket retainer <b>302</b> may generally engage a first end of the basket <b>304</b> that is opposite an extension or handle <b>314</b> of the basket <b>304</b>. More specifically, one or multiple hooks <b>310</b> fixed to the basket <b>304</b> are configured to hang over basket retainer <b>302</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0055" num="0054">In the component system <b>500</b>, agitator <b>306</b>&#x2032; is provided, which is positioned adjacent the basket <b>304</b> at a same end of the basket <b>304</b> as the handle <b>314</b>. The agitator <b>306</b>&#x2032; is configured to be extended generally vertically, such that a contact surface <b>330</b> of the agitator contacts the handle <b>314</b>, forcing the basket <b>304</b> upwards. The contact surface <b>330</b> may extend vertically any distance that is convenient. As illustrated, in an example the contact surface <b>330</b> extends from an initial height H<sub>1 </sub>(see <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b>A</figref>) relative to a support surface to an extended height H<sub>2 </sub>(see <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b>B</figref>). The agitator <b>306</b>&#x2032; may quickly and repetitively extend upwards and downwards from a base <b>332</b> of the agitator <b>306</b>&#x2032;, causing the handle <b>314</b> to be &#x201c;bounced&#x201d; up and down, impacting the agitator <b>306</b>&#x2032; and/or the contact surface <b>330</b>. In this manner, the agitator <b>306</b>&#x2032; causes repetitive contact between the handle <b>314</b> of the basket <b>304</b> and the agitator <b>306</b>&#x2032;.</p>
<p id="p-0056" num="0055">In an example, the agitator <b>306</b>&#x2032; comprises one or more pneumatic cylinders <b>334</b> extending from the base <b>332</b>, which is mounted to the food processing device <b>106</b> adjacent the vat <b>110</b>. As the pneumatic cylinders are extended from the base <b>332</b>, e.g., due to increase/decrease of pneumatic pressure, the contact surface <b>330</b> is brought into repetitive contact with the handle <b>314</b> and/or basket <b>304</b>, thereby imparting a shaking or otherwise repetitive motion of the basket <b>304</b> relatively quickly. Accordingly, consumable items <b>308</b> within the basket <b>304</b> are generally caused to break apart into smaller and/or individual pieces as a result of collisions with other consumable items <b>308</b> and/or interior walls of the basket <b>304</b>. Additionally, the reciprocating agitator <b>306</b>&#x2032; may impact the handle <b>314</b> or other part of the basket <b>304</b> with sufficient force that the handle <b>314</b> (or, for that matter, any other part of the basket <b>304</b> being repetitively contacted) is forced away or &#x201c;bounced&#x201d; off of the contact surface <b>330</b> repeatedly. As a result, the agitator <b>306</b>&#x2032; causes the repetitive contact to be interspersed with a lack of contact between the reciprocating agitator <b>306</b>&#x2032; and the basket <b>304</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0057" num="0056">As noted above, the pneumatic cylinder(s) <b>334</b> generally extend and lower in a vertical direction with respect to the food processing device <b>106</b>. As such, the reciprocal motion is vertically oriented with respect to the basket retainer <b>302</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0058" num="0057">The agitator <b>306</b>&#x2032; may operate with any frequency, force, etc. that is convenient to impart a desired shaking or reciprocating movement to the basket <b>304</b>. In an example, the reciprocating agitator <b>306</b>&#x2032; in the illustrated example of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>5</b>A and <b>5</b>B</figref> reciprocates at a frequency of 0-6 Hz (i.e., up to six times per second). In another example, the reciprocating agitator <b>306</b>&#x2032; reciprocates with an amplitude of 0-4 inches per oscillation (e.g., corresponding to a distance traveled by the contact surface <b>330</b>, or a difference between height H<sub>1 </sub>and H<sub>2 </sub>as illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>5</b>A and <b>5</b>B</figref>). In a further example, the reciprocating agitator <b>306</b>&#x2032; may reciprocate with at a frequency of 0-6 Hz and an amplitude of 0-4 inches per oscillation. These examples are not limiting, however, and any other amplitude or frequency of the oscillation or reciprocation of the reciprocating agitator <b>306</b>&#x2032; may be employed that is convenient. The reciprocation of the agitator <b>306</b>&#x2032; (and, for that matter, of agitator <b>306</b>) may involve a repetitive translational motion between two endpoints.</p>
<p id="p-0059" num="0058">As noted above, in some example approaches the food processing apparatus may be included in an automated food preparation system. The automated food preparation system may comprise a robot, robotic arm <b>102</b>, conveyors, or any other automated movement mechanisms configured to move consumable items <b>308</b>, e.g., from an ingredient storage to a cooking device <b>106</b>, and from the cooking device(s) <b>106</b> to a finishing device. Accordingly, robot arm <b>102</b> may be used to position a basket <b>304</b> of consumable items <b>308</b> on the basket retainer <b>302</b> positioned atop a cooking device <b>106</b><i>a</i>/<b>106</b><i>b</i>. The robotic arm <b>102</b> may also remove the basket <b>304</b> from the basket retainer <b>302</b>, and/or transport the fried consumable items <b>308</b> into a finishing device after shaking initiated by the agitator <b>306</b> and/or <b>306</b>&#x2032; and basket retainer <b>302</b>, e.g., as described above.</p>
<p id="p-0060" num="0059">The basket retainer <b>302</b>, in the examples illustrated above, may be positioned above a food processing device <b>106</b>, e.g., a fryer, such that the agitator is configured to drop excess frying medium back into the vat <b>110</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0061" num="0060">As noted above, a basket guide <b>312</b> may be provided to enhance the degree to which a robot, e.g., robot arm <b>102</b>, may place a basket <b>304</b> securely and safely throughout a life cycle of the involved components. Referring now to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>6</b>, <b>7</b>A, and <b>7</b>B</figref>, the basket guide <b>312</b> will be described in further detail.</p>
<p id="p-0062" num="0061">Generally, variations in the basket <b>304</b> or other food processing containers may occur, e.g., due to manufacturing tolerances or wear of components due to the extreme nature of the deep frying cooking environments. Further, different basket <b>304</b> may deflect or wear in different ways, or may be of different ages, causing positional variations from basket to basket. The automated device (e.g., the robotic arm) may be trained with one food processing container or basket using a blind pick and place protocol. Generally, this training process depends on the food processing container being in the exact, same position or substantially so in order to execute maneuvers to fry contents of the basket. In some embodiments, the order of the food processing containers may be changed, in which case the automated device may have difficulty adapting to the respective orientations of the other food processing containers/baskets, and as a result may be prone to dropping the new food processing container it blindly picks. Additionally, twist in handle <b>314</b> or other attachment extension of the basket <b>304</b> may result in the food processing container dipping towards the food processing area, e.g., into the vat <b>110</b>. Manufacturer variance of baskets <b>304</b> or other food processing containers, and/or the hangers <b>310</b>, may also affect the height of the handle <b>314</b>. Automated devices such as robot <b>102</b> may not be able to compensate for the variation in height of the handle <b>314</b> and may tend to &#x201c;miss&#x201d; gripping the handle <b>314</b> when attempting to pick up the basket <b>304</b>. In some embodiments, the basket <b>304</b> may be horizontally askew (e.g., along the x-axis) on the hanger of the food processing device <b>106</b>, which may contribute to an inability of the automated device such as robot arm <b>102</b> to securely grip the basket <b>304</b> and/or handle <b>314</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0063" num="0062">Additionally, repeatability in height of handle <b>314</b> or other attachment extension may generally be difficult to achieve, which makes it challenging for the automated device (e.g., the robotic arm <b>102</b>) to securely grip handle <b>314</b> and/or basket <b>304</b> when the order of the food processing containers <b>304</b> within the food processing device is switched. In some embodiments, manufacturing tolerance along with normal frying operation of the food processing containers may contribute to the height inconsistencies with each handle <b>314</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0064" num="0063">Positional variations and/or twist may be caused between the handle <b>314</b> or other attachment extension relative to the basket <b>304</b>. Additionally, rotation of the one or more attachment hooks' <b>310</b> x-z plane about its y-axis obstructs the plane of the hangers <b>310</b>, no longer making them co-planar, as a result of the attachment extension (e.g., the handle <b>314</b>) experiencing twist. The twist may occur as a result of use of the basket <b>304</b> and handle <b>314</b> over time, attrition from the fry cooking process, and/or manufacturer variance. This misalignment can interfere with the automated device (e.g., the robotic arm <b>102</b>) executing a relative movement of placing the basket's attachment hooks <b>310</b> upon the basket retainer <b>302</b> to allow the basket <b>304</b> to rest. In some cases this can result in the basket's hooks <b>310</b> hitting the top of the basket retainer <b>302</b> and/or the basket <b>304</b> not being securely mounted to the basket retainer <b>302</b> or other hanger. In an extreme case, the basket <b>304</b> may become dislodged from the basket retainer <b>302</b> and fall into the food processing area below the basket retainer <b>302</b>, e.g., into the vat <b>110</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0065" num="0064">Accordingly, as illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>6</b>, <b>7</b>A, and <b>7</b>B</figref>, example basket guides <b>312</b> are illustrated and described in further detail which may facilitate accurate placement of baskets <b>304</b> despite such wear, fatigue, or the like of the basket <b>304</b>, handle <b>314</b>, or other components. More specifically, the hooks <b>310</b> may be positioned above the food processing area, connected to the second side of the basket, with a basket guide <b>312</b> extending upwardly between the attachment hooks <b>310</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0066" num="0065">The basket guide <b>312</b> may have any configuration that is convenient. The basket guide <b>312</b> depicted in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>6</b>, <b>7</b>A, and <b>7</b>B</figref> generally includes an angled parabolic lead-in feature or basket guide <b>312</b>, which compensates for misalignment by the one or more attachment hooks <b>310</b>, e.g., as a result of twist in the attachment extension (e.g., the handle <b>314</b>) extending from the first side of the basket <b>304</b>. The parabola's generally pointed tip <b>600</b> and forward angle may facilitate self-centering of the food processing container (e.g., basket <b>304</b>), which ensures a repeatable location for the automated device (e.g., the robotic arm <b>102</b>) to blindly pick handle <b>314</b> or other attachment extension. Accordingly, the automated device may securely grip and maneuver any basket <b>304</b>, as opposed to a single food processing container the automated device trains with, within a food processing apparatus or system due to a consistent placement of the basket <b>304</b> on basket guide <b>312</b>. It will be understood that the basket guide <b>312</b> doesn't require maintaining co-planar alignment between the one or more attachment hooks <b>310</b> of the basket <b>304</b> and the hanger(s) <b>310</b>. To center the basket <b>304</b>, the automated device may initially determine that the point <b>600</b> of the basket guide <b>312</b> resides within a field (e.g., an x-z plane) of the one or more attachment hooks before lowering the food processing container <b>304</b> onto the basket guide <b>312</b>. The basket guide <b>312</b> is self-centering in all three spacial axes (e.g., x, y, and z), so, in some embodiments, the automated device may lower the one or more attachment hooks <b>310</b> over the basket guide <b>312</b> with a sizeable margin of error. The basket <b>304</b> may become centered as long as the point of the basket guide <b>312</b> initially resides within the x-z plane of the one or more attachment hooks <b>310</b> before further lowering the basket <b>304</b>. In other words, to any extent the attachment hooks <b>310</b> and/or basket <b>304</b> is misaligned, as the basket <b>304</b> is lowered opposing guide surfaces <b>602</b><i>a</i>, <b>602</b><i>b </i>of the basket <b>304</b> will engage the attachment hooks <b>310</b>, bringing the attachment hooks <b>310</b> to the appropriate resting place at a base <b>604</b> of the basket guide <b>312</b>. It will be understood that the basket guide <b>312</b> can accommodate a substantial amount of twist in the handle <b>314</b> or otherwise in the basket <b>304</b> and, as mentioned above, allows the automated device (e.g., the robotic arm <b>102</b>) to swap between different baskets <b>304</b> despite significant positional variations from basket to basket.</p>
<p id="p-0067" num="0066"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>7</b>A</figref> generally shows the x-y plane (indicated by x-arrow and y-arrow) of the basket guide <b>312</b> attached to the basket <b>304</b>, while <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>7</b>B</figref> shows the z-axis (indicated by z-arrow) of the basket guide <b>312</b> attached to the basket <b>304</b>. As mentioned above, the basket guide <b>312</b> depicted in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>7</b>A</figref> and <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>7</b>B</figref> is generally self-centering in all three spatial axes due to the relatively wide base <b>604</b> of the basket guide <b>312</b>. In an example, the base <b>604</b> defines a width of approximately 2.6 inches, being approximately the same width as a distance D between the two attachment hooks <b>310</b> connected to the second side of the basket <b>304</b>. Additionally, the relatively narrow and/or pointed tip <b>600</b> of the basket guide <b>312</b>, and a forward angle of the basket guide <b>312</b> (i.e., an angle of the guide relative to a vertical direction of the food processing device) also facilitate consistent placement of the basket <b>304</b> on the guide <b>312</b>. In an example, the forward angle (e.g., as represented by angle &#x3b2; illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>7</b>B</figref>) is between 5&#xb0; and 30&#xb0;. The illustrated guide <b>312</b> comprises a parabolic shape at least at an uppermost portion or vertex <b>600</b> of the guide <b>312</b>, and which may extend from the base <b>604</b> (i.e., where the guide <b>312</b> attaches to or joins with the food processing or cooking device). A vertex <b>600</b> of the parabolic shape may be located at the uppermost portion. The edges <b>602</b> of the basket guide gradually widen from the basket guide's vertex <b>600</b> or point to form its base <b>604</b>. Accordingly, as seen in the example illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>7</b>A and <b>7</b>B</figref>, the basket guide <b>312</b> is angled from the base <b>604</b> in a direction moving from above the food processing area toward the vat <b>110</b>, coinciding with a direction of the basket <b>304</b> approaching a resting position on the basket retainer <b>302</b>. As best seen in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>7</b>A</figref>, an angle &#x3b1; of the basket guide <b>312</b> (relative to a vertical direction of the food processing device, as shown) may be dictated by a height of the vertex <b>600</b> of the guide <b>312</b> (i.e., in the y-direction) relative to and a width of the base <b>604</b>. The width of the base <b>604</b> may correspond to a lateral spacing (i.e., in the x-direction) between the hooks <b>310</b>. Generally, a larger y-dimension of the vertex <b>600</b> and/or the guide <b>312</b> will result in a relatively smaller angle &#x3b1;. Similarly, a smaller x-dimension of the width of the base <b>604</b> will also result in a relatively smaller angle &#x3b1;. Merely as one example, the angle &#x3b1; may be less than 25 degrees.</p>
<p id="p-0068" num="0067">Generally, an automated device (e.g., the robotic arm <b>102</b>) may initially place the basket/attachment hooks <b>310</b> such that the vertex <b>600</b> or point of the basket guide <b>312</b> resides within the x-z plane <b>606</b> (see <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>6</b></figref>) of the one or more attachment hooks <b>310</b>. The automated device may then lower the basket <b>304</b> until its hooks <b>310</b> are securely positioned at the base <b>604</b> of the basket guide <b>312</b>, thus securing the basket <b>304</b> above the food processing area and/or the vat <b>110</b>. In the examples illustrated, the automated device is afforded approximately a 1.3-inch margin of error along the x-axis of the basket guide <b>312</b> due to its width being approximately 2.6 inches. Any other size guide may be employed to provide a desired margin of error that is convenient. It should be noted that the width between the hooks <b>310</b> may also correspond to or be slightly larger than the width of the base <b>604</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0069" num="0068"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>6</b> and <b>7</b>A</figref> depict the point <b>600</b> of the basket guide, i.e., an uppermost point of the guide, positioned within the x-z plane <b>606</b> (see <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>6</b></figref>) of the one or more attachment hooks <b>310</b> located at the second side of the basket <b>304</b>. Training the automated device (e.g., the robotic arm) with the basket guide <b>312</b> includes moving the automated device to an indexing position over a food processing device <b>106</b> in one of the four locations within the food processing device, teaching the automated device a pick and place routine (e.g., opening a gripper of the arm <b>102</b>, moving the arm <b>102</b> downward towards the food processing device <b>106</b>, closing the gripper on the handle <b>314</b>, moving the arm <b>102</b> upward with the basket <b>304</b> to secure its place on the basket guide <b>312</b> with a machine learning algorithm, and globally applying the pick and place routine to the remaining food processing containers or baskets <b>304</b> in the remaining locations within the food processing device <b>106</b>. In some embodiments, any number of baskets <b>304</b> or other food processing containers may be included at an equal number of locations within the food processing device <b>106</b>. In at least one example, each basket <b>304</b> may have a generally same design and/or dimensions. In an example, the basket <b>304</b> is 14 inches apart (center-to-center) from each other, so robot arm <b>102</b> may be offset by a fixed pitch (e.g., 14 inches) and then re-executes the pick and place routine with each available basket <b>304</b>. In some embodiments, each basket <b>304</b> may be separated by any fixed pitch or distance. As described earlier, the automated device determines the point <b>600</b> of the basket guide <b>312</b> resides within the x-z plane <b>606</b> of the one or more attachment hooks <b>310</b> before securing the basket <b>304</b> onto the basket guide <b>312</b>. It will be understood that the basket guide <b>312</b>, as depicted in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>7</b>A and <b>7</b>B</figref>, tolerates extreme planar misalignment, caused by twist incorporated in the handle <b>314</b> or other extension from the basket <b>304</b>, between the one or more attachment hooks <b>310</b> and the basket retainer <b>302</b>. Generally, locating the relatively small uppermost point <b>600</b> inside the relatively larger field in the x-z plane <b>606</b> may increase repeatability and reduces the chance that an automated basket movement device such as robot arm <b>102</b> may &#x201c;miss&#x201d; placement of a hook <b>310</b> or other hanger of the basket <b>304</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0070" num="0069">As noted above, in at least some example approaches automated food preparation may be assisted at least in part by a robotic arm <b>102</b>, e.g., for handling and/or movement of basket <b>304</b>. Referring now to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>8</b> and <b>9</b></figref>, another example component system <b>800</b> is described in further detail that is configured to facilitate detection, gripping, and handling of handle <b>314</b>, e.g., for the purposes moving basket <b>304</b> as part of a process to fry consumable items. The system <b>800</b> may be employed for gripping and/or manipulation of any other extensions or elongated members. Generally, one or more sensors may be provided that are configured to determine a proximity of handle <b>314</b> or other elongate members or extensions in order to facilitate gripping the same. However, example sensors and sensing methods may be used in the context of any other gripping apparatus or manipulator that is convenient, and are not limited to the illustrated examples herein.</p>
<p id="p-0071" num="0070">As noted above, basket <b>304</b> may have dimensional tolerances associated with various features. For example, hooks <b>310</b> may extend from a front surface of the basket <b>304</b>, e.g., for gripping a tab or lip of cooking device <b>106</b> so that basket <b>304</b> can hang while the contents such as consumable items <b>308</b> are fried. The hanging of the basket <b>304</b> may allow a cooking medium, e.g., fryer oil, to drip off back into the vat <b>110</b> and the fried contents to cool. Additionally, the handle <b>314</b> or other extension extending away from the basket <b>304</b>, as noted above, may be arranged at a height to enable the basket <b>304</b> to submerge contents below a surface of oil (or any other suitable cooking medium) in vat <b>110</b>. The handle <b>314</b> typically protrudes out of the vat <b>110</b> and/or cooking medium therein so it may be accessible, e.g., for picking up and moving the fryer basket <b>304</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0072" num="0071">The robotic arm <b>102</b> may be employed to grab the fryer basket handle <b>314</b> and move the fryer basket as part of an automated or robotic fried food preparation method or system <b>100</b>, as discussed above. Reliance on a height of the fryer basket handle <b>314</b> relative to a fryer feature, such as an edge of vat <b>110</b>, can change a location of the handle <b>314</b> relative to the basket <b>304</b> and may thereby prevent consistent grabbing of the fryer handle <b>314</b>. This may cause inadequate grip of the handle <b>314</b>, potentially leading to the fryer basket's contents, e.g., consumable items <b>308</b>, being spilled or overcooking of the contents. For example, relying upon contact of a robotic arm <b>102</b> or end effector thereof with handle <b>314</b>, e.g., by detecting contact with a pressure sensor or the like, may yield inconsistent fryer basket handling because of variation between fryer basket assemblies. For example, as also noted above, variations in mounting hooks <b>310</b> and/or orientation of the handle <b>314</b> with respect to the basket <b>304</b> may cause the handle <b>314</b> to be positioned at different heights or locations. Accordingly, pressure sensors or the like may receive inconsistent force or load readings when force is applied downwards to grip the handle <b>314</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0073" num="0072">Accordingly, examples herein such as the component system <b>800</b> illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>8</b> and <b>9</b></figref> may generally employ a sensor <b>802</b> configured to determine a proximity of the handle to a gripping location, e.g., within a handle opening of a gripper assembly. In some examples, a beam <b>803</b> is projected such that the sensor <b>802</b> detects an interruption of the beam <b>803</b>, e.g., based upon a beam interrupt logic. Additional sensors generally may not be needed, and the robotic arm <b>102</b> may consistently grab handle <b>314</b> or other features of fryer basket <b>304</b>. System <b>800</b> may also include at least one apparatus, station, or subsystem configured to grab handle <b>314</b>, e.g., robot arm <b>102</b>, to facilitate positioning or movement of fryer baskets <b>304</b>. Additionally, component system <b>800</b> may be incorporated into or otherwise interface with existing automated food preparation systems, e.g., system <b>100</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0074" num="0073">In the examples illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>8</b> and <b>9</b></figref>, the fryer basket grabber apparatus or manipulator <b>806</b> and components thereof are generally comprised of aluminum. However, examples herein may be applied without limitation to other applications, and example manipulators may include components formed of other materials (e.g., a plastics or any other known food safe material).</p>
<p id="p-0075" num="0074">In the example illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>8</b> and <b>9</b></figref>, the grabbing apparatus or manipulator <b>806</b> generally comprises a first extension <b>808</b> defining a first handle opening <b>810</b>, and a second extension <b>812</b> defining a second handle opening <b>814</b>. The second handle opening <b>814</b>, as illustrated, is generally closer to a distal end of the robot arm <b>102</b> than the first handle opening <b>810</b>. The manipulator <b>806</b> further includes a gripper assembly <b>816</b> configured to enclose handle <b>314</b> or other extension within the first handle opening <b>810</b> and the second handle opening <b>814</b>. The manipulator <b>806</b> may also have a sensor <b>802</b> configured to determine a proximity of the handle <b>314</b> to the second handle opening <b>814</b>. In some examples, the sensor <b>802</b> may be configured to determine a proximity of the handle <b>314</b> to the first handle opening <b>810</b>, either as alternative or in addition to being configured to determine proximity of the handle <b>314</b> to the second handle opening <b>814</b>. Generally, the sensor <b>802</b> is configured to detect interruption or breaking of the beam <b>803</b> projected across the second handle opening <b>814</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0076" num="0075">As noted above, in some examples, components of the fryer basket manipulator <b>806</b> may be formed of aluminum, e.g., the first extension <b>808</b>, the second extension <b>812</b>, and/or the gripper assembly <b>816</b>. In some other embodiments, the first extension <b>808</b>, the second extension <b>812</b>, and the gripper assembly <b>816</b> are each formed of a food safe plastic. As illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>8</b> and <b>9</b></figref>, the first extension <b>808</b> may be arranged rearward of the second extension <b>812</b> with respect to a free end <b>818</b> of the manipulator <b>806</b>, i.e., opposite an end <b>820</b> secured to robotic arm <b>102</b> or other movement apparatus for moving the manipulator <b>806</b>. The manipulator <b>806</b> may comprise the robot arm <b>102</b> and processing circuitry configured to interface with the sensor <b>802</b>. Accordingly, in the example illustrated the robotic arm <b>102</b> and processing circuitry are configured to interface with the sensor <b>802</b>, an emitter <b>804</b> generating the beam <b>803</b>, and the manipulator <b>806</b> and/or gripper assembly <b>816</b> thereof.</p>
<p id="p-0077" num="0076">The gripper assembly <b>816</b> may have any components for grasping or gripping handle <b>314</b>. As illustrated, the gripper assembly <b>816</b> generally employs pivotal arms or paddles configured to selectively hold handle <b>314</b> against a support surface. More specifically, gripper assembly <b>816</b> may generally have a first paddle or arm <b>824</b> pivotally connected at a proximal end <b>826</b> of the first arm <b>824</b>, such that a distal end <b>828</b> of the first arm <b>824</b> is movable toward a centerline <b>830</b> of the manipulator <b>806</b>. The gripper assembly <b>816</b> may also include a second paddle or arm <b>832</b> pivotally connected to the gripper assembly at a proximal end <b>834</b> of the second arm <b>832</b>, such that a distal end <b>836</b> of the second arm is movable toward the centerline <b>830</b>. The gripper assembly <b>816</b> may also include at least one actuator <b>838</b> configured to move or pivot at least one of the first arm <b>824</b> or the second arm <b>832</b>. For example, the actuator may rotate the arms <b>824</b>, <b>832</b> about their respective pivot points at ends <b>826</b> and <b>834</b>, or the actuator <b>838</b> may fold the arms <b>824</b>, <b>832</b> towards the centerline <b>830</b> of at least one of the fryer basket grabbing apparatus and handle <b>314</b>. The arms <b>824</b>, <b>832</b> may pivot to enclose the handle <b>314</b> against a support surface or base <b>840</b><i>a </i>of the first extension <b>808</b> and base <b>840</b><i>b </i>of the second extension <b>812</b>. With the handle <b>314</b> enclosed and trapped against the bases <b>840</b><i>a </i>and <b>840</b><i>b</i>, the basket <b>304</b> is securely held by the manipulator <b>806</b>, and the basket <b>304</b> may be moved, e.g., to place the basket <b>304</b> in a fryer or other cooking device <b>106</b>, remove the basket <b>304</b> from a frying medium, remove the basket <b>304</b> from the cooking device <b>106</b>, etc.</p>
<p id="p-0078" num="0077">In some examples, the first extension <b>808</b> includes a first pair of arms <b>809</b><i>a</i>, <b>809</b><i>b </i>that define a first outline <b>811</b> corresponding to the first handle opening <b>810</b>. Additionally, the second extension <b>812</b> may include a second pair of arms <b>813</b><i>a</i>, <b>813</b><i>b </i>that define a second outline <b>815</b> corresponding to the second handle opening <b>814</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0079" num="0078">The beam emitter <b>804</b> may be configured to emit a laser beam or a beam of light, or otherwise excite a medium arranged between the beam emitter <b>804</b> and the sensor <b>802</b>. The sensor <b>802</b> may be configured to transmit an indication that the beam <b>803</b> being transmitted by the beam emitter <b>804</b> has been interrupted, e.g., indicating that the handle <b>314</b> is in proximity to the first handle opening <b>810</b> and/or the second handle opening <b>814</b>, as indicated by at least a portion of the handle <b>314</b> being positioned between the arms <b>813</b><i>a</i>, <b>813</b><i>b </i>such that the beam <b>803</b> is interrupted. The sensor <b>802</b> and/or beam emitter <b>804</b> may be positioned on the gripper assembly <b>816</b> such that an interruption of the beam <b>803</b> occurs when the handle <b>314</b> is within a range of the second handle opening <b>814</b> small enough that the arms <b>824</b>, <b>832</b> may capture the handle <b>314</b> securely as the arms <b>824</b>, <b>832</b> pivoted to a closed position. Accordingly, the gripper assembly may be configured to enclose the basket handle <b>314</b> or other extension bringing the handle <b>314</b> against the base <b>840</b><i>a </i>and <b>840</b><i>b </i>in response to the beam of the beam emitter being interrupted, as illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>9</b></figref>.</p>

As noted above, basket <b>304</b> may be moved or manipulated within system <b>100</b>, e.g., to obtain consumable items <b>308</b> from a storage device for cooking, move the consumable items to a cooking device <b>106</b>, initiate a cooking process for the consumable items <b>308</b>, remove the consumable items <b>308</b> from the cooking device, and/or move the consumable items <b>308</b> to a finishing area or device. Accordingly, process <b>1000</b> and aspects thereof may be incorporated into or executed by the example system <b>100</b> described herein. As noted above, processing circuitry of system <b>100</b>, e.g., as embodied in the robot arm <b>102</b>, a control system for the robot arm <b>102</b>, the manipulator <b>806</b>, or other component of system <b>100</b> may enact various steps or processes within process <b>1000</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0081" num="0080">Process <b>1000</b> may begin at block <b>1005</b>. At block <b>1005</b>, a basket <b>304</b> may be guided to a basket mounting position on a food processing device, e.g., with a robot arm <b>102</b>. For example, as noted above the food processing device <b>106</b> may have a basket guide <b>312</b> having a base <b>604</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0082" num="0081">Proceeding to block <b>1010</b>, the basket guide <b>312</b> may be received in an opening of a basket holder fixed to the basket <b>304</b>. For example, as noted above a vertex or tip <b>600</b> of guide <b>312</b> may be received within an opening as defined by x-z plane <b>606</b> of the hangers <b>310</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0083" num="0082">Proceeding to block <b>1015</b>, the basket holder may be centered or manipulated by the basket guide <b>312</b> as the basket <b>304</b> descends to the basket mounting position. In an example, a positional variation of the basket <b>304</b>, handle <b>314</b>, or otherwise within system <b>100</b> may be corrected by engaging one or both hooks <b>310</b> with respective guide surfaces <b>602</b> of the basket guide <b>312</b>. As described above, the guide surfaces <b>602</b> may generally extend from an uppermost portion of the guide <b>312</b>, e.g., vertex <b>600</b>, toward the base <b>604</b>. In at least some examples, the guide surfaces <b>602</b> extend continuously from the vertex <b>600</b> to the base <b>604</b>. The guide <b>312</b> may generally narrow laterally in a direction from the base <b>604</b> to the vertex <b>600</b> (or put another way, may widen moving from the vertex <b>600</b> toward the base <b>604</b>). Accordingly, lateral positional variations may be corrected as the guide <b>312</b> contacts the hook(s) <b>310</b>, thereby nudging the basket <b>304</b> laterally as the robot arm <b>102</b> lowers the basket <b>304</b> to a mounted position, e.g., on the basket retainer <b>302</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0084" num="0083">Proceeding to block <b>1020</b>, the basket <b>304</b> containing consumable items <b>308</b> may be positioned above the vat <b>110</b>, e.g., on the basket retainer <b>302</b>. Process <b>1000</b> may initiate shaking or manipulation of the basket <b>304</b> to break up consumable items, shake off excess cooking medium, etc., either before, during, or after a cooking process has been carried out with respect to the consumable items <b>308</b>. For example, as noted above a reciprocal motion may be imparted to consumable items <b>308</b> and/or the basket <b>304</b>, e.g., by way of repetitive contact with an agitator <b>306</b> and/or <b>306</b>&#x2032;. Accordingly, reciprocal motion or agitation may be applied to the consumable items <b>308</b>, thereby encouraging breakup of the consumable items <b>308</b> into smaller or individual pieces, shaking off excess cooking medium, etc. Process <b>1000</b> may then proceed to block <b>1025</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0085" num="0084">At block <b>1025</b>, the basket <b>304</b> may be removed from the cooking device <b>106</b> and/or basket retainer <b>302</b> with a robot arm <b>102</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0086" num="0085">As part of any block or step within process <b>1000</b> involving the robot arm <b>102</b> grasping handle <b>314</b> or other extension of the basket <b>304</b>, process <b>1000</b> may detect a proximity of the handle <b>314</b> prior to grasping or contacting the handle <b>314</b>. For example, as the robot arm <b>102</b> approaches handle <b>314</b>, e.g., to pick up the basket <b>304</b> from the cooking device <b>106</b> after frying, a manipulator <b>806</b> may employ a sensor <b>802</b> to detect a proximity of the handle <b>314</b>. Merely by way of example, the proximity may be sufficient to allow the manipulator <b>806</b> to grasp the handle <b>314</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0087" num="0086">For example, as described above process <b>10000</b> may generate an indication that a beam <b>803</b> from a beam emitter <b>804</b> mounted to the robot arm <b>102</b> and/or manipulator <b>806</b> is prevented from being received by sensor <b>802</b> mounted to the robot arm <b>102</b>. The beam emitter <b>804</b>, for example, may be configured to emit a laser beam, a beam of light, or otherwise excite a medium arranged between the beam emitter <b>804</b> and the beam sensor <b>802</b> to facilitate detection of a proximity of the handle <b>314</b> for grasping by the manipulator <b>806</b>. In an example, the indication corresponds to an interruption of the reception of beam <b>803</b> generated by the beam emitter <b>804</b> by the beam sensor <b>802</b>. In response to receiving the indication, processing circuitry of the robot arm <b>102</b> may actuate gripper assembly <b>816</b> to enclose the handle <b>314</b>, e.g., by pivoting or rotating arms/paddles <b>824</b>, <b>832</b> to bring the handle <b>314</b> against base <b>840</b><i>a </i>and/or <b>840</b><i>b. </i></p>
<p id="p-0088" num="0087">Proceeding to block <b>1030</b>, the fried consumable items <b>308</b> may be delivered to a finishing station with the robot arm <b>102</b>. Process <b>1000</b> may then terminate.</p>
