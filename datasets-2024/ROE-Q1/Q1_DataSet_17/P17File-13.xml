<heading id="h-0001" level="1">FIELD OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0002" num="0001">The present invention relates to the technical sector concerning foldable tables. In particular, the present invention relates to a foldable and elongatable table.</p>
<heading id="h-0002" level="1">DESCRIPTION OF THE PRIOR ART</heading>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">Use of a foldable table is known, comprising: a rest plane; a first pair of legs arranged at a first side of the rest plane; a second pair of legs that is arranged at a second side of the rest plane, which second side is opposite and parallel to the first side.</p>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">The first pair of legs comprises a first leg and a second leg which are rotatably coupled to one another at a relative first intermediate point so as to rotate with respect to one another in a first plane that is transversal to the rest plane and the first leg is rotatably coupled to the rest plane so as to rotate with respect thereto. Further, the second pair of legs comprises a third leg and a fourth leg which are rotatably coupled to one another at a relative second intermediate point so as to rotate with respect to one another in a second plane that is transversal to the rest plane and the third leg is rotatably coupled to the rest plane so as to rotate with respect thereto.</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">In detail, the known foldable table can assume:</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">a folded configuration in which the first leg and the third leg are arranged with respect to the rest plane in such a way that the relative free end is near to the rest plane and the first leg, the second leg, the third leg and the fourth leg are arranged in such a way as to be flanked to one another;</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">an extended configuration in which the first leg and the third leg are arranged with respect to the rest plane in such a way that the relative free end is moved away from the rest plane and the first leg, the second leg, the third leg and the fourth leg are arranged in such a way that the first pair of legs and the second pair of legs delineate, respectively, a cross.</p>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">This type of foldable table is of a size to be able to set two places on the rest plane and therefore seat two people at the foldable table.</p>
<p id="p-0009" num="0008">This type of foldable table is particularly used in hotel or restaurant establishments, as a large number of the foldable tables can be stored in their folded condition in stores having only small spaces available, in particular in closed periods, or if the foldable tables are used outdoors, on days where the weather is not sunny.</p>
<p id="p-0010" num="0009">However, in particular in hotel or restaurant establishments, there is often a need to be able to set more than two places on the rest plane, as a larger number of customers might wish to be seated at a same foldable table.</p>
<p id="p-0011" num="0010">Consequently, with the aim of seating more people about a table of this type, more than one table would have to be arranged, in the relative extended configuration, one by the side of another.</p>
<p id="p-0012" num="0011">Therefore, the hotel or restaurant establishments must have a plurality of foldable tables of the above-described type available.</p>
<p id="p-0013" num="0012">Further, the fact of having to provide a further table and arrange it by the side of another table leads to inconvenience not only for the customer but also for the waiter who will have to perform the task.</p>
<heading id="h-0003" level="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0014" num="0013">In the light of the above, the aim of the present invention consists in obviating the above-mentioned drawback.</p>
<p id="p-0015" num="0014">The above aim is attained by a foldable and elongatable table according to claim <b>1</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0016" num="0015">The rotation coupling of a leg with respect to the other of the first pair of legs, of the second pair of legs and of the third pair of legs and, further, the rotation coupling of the first leg and the third leg with respect to the rest plane, together with the first telescopic connection and the second telescopic connection, advantageously enable the foldable and elongatable table to assume the folded configuration, the extended configuration and the elongated configuration.</p>
<p id="p-0017" num="0016">The rotation coupling enables the rotation of the legs of the first pair of legs, of the second pair of legs and third pair of legs so that they can be arranged to assume the folded configuration, with the purpose of being able to store, in the warehouse, the foldable and elongatable table, and to assume the extended configuration with the purpose of being able to use the foldable and elongatable table.</p>
<p id="p-0018" num="0017">At the same time, the first telescopic connection and the second telescopic connection enable moving the fifth leg with respect to the first leg and the sixth leg with respect to the second leg so that the third pair of legs is movable between a first position proximal to the second pair of legs and a second position distal to the second pair of legs.</p>
<p id="p-0019" num="0018">Consequently it is possible to arrange the foldable and elongatable table in the elongated configuration, should it be desired to increase the relative extension of the rest plane: in fact, it is possible to arrange a supplementary portion of the rest plane resting on the free end of the fifth leg and the sixth leg and the third pair of legs is in the second position.</p>
