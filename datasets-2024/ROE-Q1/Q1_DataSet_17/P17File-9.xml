<?summary-of-invention description="Summary of Invention" end="lead"?>
<p id="p-0002" num="0001">The present invention relates to an inhalation device. More particularly, the invention relates to a foam inhalation device, and in particular to a stable-foam inhalation device. Although described as an inhalation device, the device may also be considered to be a consumption, drawing or dispensing device and/or a tobacco-industry foam device.</p>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">Inhalation devices typically are for users to inhale or consume substances or compounds. Such substances may have a variety of effects on the user, for example medicinal, therapeutic, stimulatory, relaxative or pleasurable effects. For example, a user may inhale medicines or tobacco components such as nicotine.</p>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">Traditional techniques for consuming or inhaling compounds such as nicotine rely on burning tobacco and either directly inhaling the smoke produced therefrom, for example as in cigarettes, or inhaling the smoke having passed through water, as in shisha or hookah. However, health concerns regarding smoke inhalation have created a need for non-smoking alternatives for inhaling compounds.</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">Typical alternatives include vaporisers or e-cigarettes. These involve heating a substance until it forms a vapour. However, health concerns have been raised regarding vaporisers. Medical inhalers are known. However, such inhalers rapidly propel an aerosol into a users respiratory system, and therefore provide a significantly different experience to smoking, which is done gradually and repeatedly by a user inhaling through a device over a prolonged duration.</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">It would therefore be desirable to provide a means of producing a substance for consumption or inhalation, and which can be inhaled or drawn via a user's breath over a prolonged period, without requiring the use of a vaporiser or burning. Such an alternative may also find application in pharmaceutical, health and exercise fields, as well as the food and beverage industry.</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">The present invention seeks to provide a solution to these problems.</p>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">According to a first aspect of the present invention, there is provided a foam inhalation device for dispensing a foam to be inhaled by a user, the inhalation device comprising: a foam-generating-component receiving portion; a foam-generating component for generating the foam; an outlet for dispensing the foam to the user; a fluid flow path which fluidly communicates the foam-generating-component receiving portion with the outlet so that the foam is generatable by the component which flows to the outlet via the fluid flow path to be inhaled by the user.</p>
<p id="p-0009" num="0008">The device may otherwise be described as a foam consuming device, foam drawing device, foam dispensing device, or tobacco-industry foam device.</p>
<p id="p-0010" num="0009">Preferably, the device may further comprise a foam-volume-dispensation control element for limiting a volume of foam dispensed by the outlet. This slows the progress of the foam to the user, for example via friction, reducing the volume of foam which the user can inhale. Therefore, the user is able to inhale foam over a longer duration.</p>
<p id="p-0011" num="0010">Advantageously, the foam-volume-dispensation control element may be at the outlet.</p>
<p id="p-0012" num="0011">Beneficially, the foam-volume-dispensation control element may be a partial barrier which obstructs part of a cross-sectional area of the fluid flow path.</p>
<p id="p-0013" num="0012">Optionally, the partial barrier may comprise a porous material having a plurality of holes of less than 2 mm diameter. A plurality of holes, as opposed to a single hole, increases the amount of friction imparted to the foam and therefore more effectively reduces the speed of user consumption of the foam. Smaller holes may provide more friction, although preferably the holes may be larger than an average diameter of the bubbles of the foam to avoid disruption to the foam's texture.</p>
<p id="p-0014" num="0013">In a preferable embodiment, the partial barrier may comprise sintered metal. Additionally, the partial barrier may comprise sintered steel. Sintered metal, and in particular sintered steel, provides a suitably porous material.</p>
<p id="p-0015" num="0014">Preferably, the device may further comprise an air inlet in fluid communication with the fluid flow path between the outlet and the foam-generating-component receiving portion, the air inlet being spaced apart from and to a side of the outlet. The air inlet allows for air to be drawn into the fluid flow path so as to dilute the foam. This may dilute a user's consumption of particular ingredients of the foam. For example, if the foam comprises nicotine, then the delivery level of nicotine of the device is reduced.</p>
<p id="p-0016" num="0015">Beneficially, the air inlet may be spaced apart from the outlet by at least 20 mm. This may provide sufficient spacing so that a user's mouth does not obstruct the air inlet when drawing on the outlet.</p>
<p id="p-0017" num="0016">Advantageously, the device may further comprise a valve between the foam-generating-component receiving portion and the outlet for selectively permitting foam to flow therebetween, the valve being opened and/or closed via a user control. The use of a controllable valve allows the user to stop the foam from flowing out of the outlet when this is desired. Therefore, possible leakages of the device are reduced or prevented when the device is not in active use.</p>
<p id="p-0018" num="0017">Optionally, the valve may be biased to a closed condition so that the user control is required to be continuously operated to hold open the valve. This prevents the user from accidentally leaving the valve open when not in active use, and therefore unintentional foam leakage from the device is prevented or limited.</p>
<p id="p-0019" num="0018">Additionally, the valve may be biased via a spring.</p>
<p id="p-0020" num="0019">In a preferable embodiment, the user control may be a push button.</p>
<p id="p-0021" num="0020">Preferably, there may be a plurality of foam-generating components, at least one at least one of said foam-generating components being segregated from another of said foam-generating components by an openable barrier.</p>
<p id="p-0022" num="0021">Advantageously, the device may further comprise a pointed protrusion for opening the openable barrier.</p>
<p id="p-0023" num="0022">Beneficially, the device may further comprise a pull tab for opening the openable barrier.</p>
<p id="p-0024" num="0023">Optionally, the openable barrier may comprise a valve, and the device may further comprise a user control for moving the valve so as to communicate the foam-generating components.</p>
<p id="p-0025" num="0024">Additionally, the foam inhalation device may be a stable-foam inhalation device for dispensing a stable foam, and the foam-generating component may be a stable-foam-generating component.</p>
<p id="p-0026" num="0025">Preferably, the fluid-flow path may comprise a conduit at or adjacent to the outlet.</p>
<p id="p-0027" num="0026">Advantageously, the fluid-flow path may comprise an expansion chamber between the foam-generating-component receiving portion and the outlet. An expansion chamber provides space for the foam to expand into, and thus may allow for short-term storage of the foam before being inhaled.</p>
<p id="p-0028" num="0027">Preferably, the stable-foam-generating component may be received in a non-electrical inhalation cartridge. A non-electrical inhalation cartridge reduces or eliminates a requirement for electrical charging. A cartridge provides a convenient way of loading stable-foam-generating components into the device, and permitting reuse of the remainder of the device with further cartridges.</p>
<p id="p-0029" num="0028">Beneficially, the non-electrical inhalation cartridge may comprise at least one finger grip at a distal end thereof relative to the outlet. This provides a means for easier withdrawal of the cartridge from the carrier.</p>
<p id="p-0030" num="0029">In a preferable embodiment, there are a plurality of stable-foam-generating components which together comprise a carbonate and an acid.</p>
<p id="p-0031" num="0030">The device may have a mouthpiece which defines the outlet.</p>
<p id="p-0032" num="0031">According to a second aspect of the present invention, there is provided a foam inhalation device comprising: an element for producing a foam; agitation means for agitating the element to produce the foam; and an outlet for dispensing the foam to a user.</p>
<p id="p-0033" num="0032">According to a third aspect of the invention, there is provided a stable-foam inhalation device for dispensing a stable foam to be inhaled by a user over a prolonged duration, the inhalation device comprising: a foam-generating-component receiving portion; stable-foam-generating components for generating the stable foam, said components being receivable at or in the component receiving portion, at least one of said components being segregated from another of said components by an openable barrier; an outlet for dispensing the stable foam to the user; a fluid flow path which fluidly communicates the foam-generating-component receiving portion with the outlet so that when the barrier is opened the components interact to generate the stable foam which flows to the outlet via the fluid flow path to be inhaled by the user over a prolonged duration.</p>
<p id="p-0034" num="0033">A stable foam, as opposed to only a short-lived effervescence and/or a rapidly propelled inhalant, may allow for a user to consume or inhale a substance contained within the foam slowly, over a prolonged duration and with multiple inhalations. This can provide a satisfying and pleasurable experience for the user. The barrier maintains separation between the components until the user wishes to inhale foam, at which point the barrier may be broken to permit generation of foam.</p>
<p id="p-0035" num="0034">The foam-generating-component receiving portion may otherwise be referred to as a foam-generating-component receiver, or a port, dock or a chamber.</p>
<p id="p-0036" num="0035">Preferably, at least one of the stable-foam-generating components may be received in a non-electrical inhalation cartridge. A non-electrical inhalation cartridge reduces or eliminates a requirement for electrical charging. A cartridge provides a convenient way of loading stable-foam-generating components into the device, and permitting reuse of the remainder of the device with further cartridges.</p>
<p id="p-0037" num="0036">Beneficially, at least one of the stable-foam-generating components may comprise a liquid which is received in a liquid-receiving chamber of the non-electrical inhalation cartridge.</p>
<p id="p-0038" num="0037">Advantageously, the liquid may be dispensable from the liquid-receiving chamber via manual pressure applied to the chamber. Manual dispensation is convenient and prevents or limits the requirement for complex mechanisms.</p>
<p id="p-0039" num="0038">In a preferable embodiment, at least one of the stable-foam-generating components may comprises a solid which is received in a solid-receiving chamber of the non-electrical inhalation cartridge.</p>
<p id="p-0040" num="0039">Additionally, the openable barrier may be between the solid-receiving chamber and the liquid-receiving chamber.</p>
<p id="p-0041" num="0040">Preferably, there may be two stable-foam-generating components, each stable-foam-generating component being received in a separate chamber, one of the chambers being on a path between the other chamber and the outlet so that the stable-foam-generating components mix in said other chamber. Therefore, the stable-foam-generating components are encouraged to mix which reduces the amount of unreacted material and thus reduces wastage.</p>
<p id="p-0042" num="0041">Advantageously, the cartridge may include a further openable barrier at or adjacent to an end thereof and fluidly communicable with the fluid flow path so that when the further openable barrier is opened, foam or at least one stable-foam-generating component are flowable to the fluid flow path. The further barrier may help to contain the stable-foam-generating components when the cartridge is not inserted into the carrier.</p>
<p id="p-0043" num="0042">Beneficially, the or each openable barrier may be a planar seal.</p>
<p id="p-0044" num="0043">In a preferable embodiment, the or each openable barrier may comprise a foil. A foil, such as a metal foil, can provide a good seal between the components to maintain a long storage lifetime of the device, whilst being easily perforable or openable when required.</p>
<p id="p-0045" num="0044">Optionally, the outlet and at least part of the fluid flow path may be defined by a carrier for the non-electrical inhalation cartridge.</p>
<p id="p-0046" num="0045">Preferably, the fluid flow path may comprise a conduit at or adjacent to the outlet and an expansion chamber between the foam-generating-component receiving portion and the conduit. An expansion chamber provides space for the foam to expand into, and thus may allow for short-term storage of the foam before being inhaled.</p>
<p id="p-0047" num="0046">Advantageously, the expansion chamber may be defined by the carrier. Since the expansion chamber would not be part of the disposable cartridge, wastage is reduced.</p>
<p id="p-0048" num="0047">In a preferable embodiment, the conduit may have an inlet opening which is off-centre relative to the expansion chamber. Such an arrangement allows for the inlet opening to be at an in use lower position. Therefore, as the foam is consumed and a level of foam reduces in the expansion chamber, a greater total amount of foam can be accessed since the remaining foam would occupy the lower portion of the expansion chamber under gravity.</p>
<p id="p-0049" num="0048">Beneficially, the conduit may have an inlet opening and a longitudinal extent which locates the inlet opening closer to the foam-generating-component receiving portion than to the outlet. This allows for foam to be inhaled away from an end of the cartridge. In other words, the foam may be drawn to the outlet from a more central region of the expansion chamber, which may improve the consistency of foam at the outlet.</p>
<p id="p-0050" num="0049">Preferably, the device may further comprise a protrusion for assisting with dispensation of one of the stable-foam-generating components. The protrusion may be pointed, and thus may be considered to be a needle, which may assist with perforation of the barrier.</p>
<p id="p-0051" num="0050">Additionally, the protrusion may be for perforating the or each openable barrier, the protrusion including a passageway for permitting passage of foam or stable-foam-generating component therethrough. A passageway, such as a bore or channel, prevents the protrusion from blocking the hole or perforation formed by the protrusion.</p>
<p id="p-0052" num="0051">Optionally, the protrusion may be configured to perforate both openable barriers.</p>
<p id="p-0053" num="0052">Advantageously, there may be two protrusions, a second protrusion configured to project into one chamber, and a first protrusion configured to project into at least the other chamber. These protrusions may be spaced apart, which permits for more efficient mixing of the components.</p>
<p id="p-0054" num="0053">Beneficially, the device may further comprise a one-way valve for permitting movement of foam from the foam-generating-component receiving portion to the outlet and preventing or limiting movement of fluid from the outlet to the foam-generating-component receiving portion.</p>
<p id="p-0055" num="0054">In a preferable embodiment, the stable-foam-generating components may together comprise a carbonate and an acid. This allows for effervescence by producing carbon dioxide via a chemical reaction. A chemical reaction, as opposed to, for example, releasing a pressurised container, is more convenient for manufacturing purposes. Although a carbonate is described, more generally the stable-foam-generating components may together comprise a base and an acid. The stable-foam-generating components may alternatively comprise any chemical gas generation means, in particular carbon dioxide generation means. It will be appreciated that the stable-foam-generating components may, for example, comprise a sugar and a component for converting the sugar to carbon dioxide, such as yeast.</p>
<p id="p-0056" num="0055">Additionally, at least one of the carbonate and acid may be a powder. A powder has a larger surface are than other solids and therefore may more rapidly generate foam.</p>
<p id="p-0057" num="0056">Preferably, the barrier may be opened by being broken.</p>
<p id="p-0058" num="0057">Beneficially, one of the stable-foam-generating components may comprise a stabiliser.</p>
<p id="p-0059" num="0058">Additionally, one of the stable-foam-generating components may comprise a thickener.</p>
<p id="p-0060" num="0059">According to a fourth aspect of the invention, there is provided a method of increasing a duration of inhalation activity, the method comprising the steps of: providing the device as claimed in any one of the preceding claims; opening the barrier so that the foam-generating components react to generate the stable foam which flows to the outlet via the fluid flow path; and inhaling the stable foam with multiple inhalations.</p>
<p id="p-0061" num="0060">According to a fifth aspect of the invention, there is provided a nicotine inhalation device for dispensing a stable foam to be inhaled by a user over a prolonged duration, the inhalation device comprising: a foam-generating-component receiving portion; a non-electrical inhalation cartridge having stable-foam-generating components for generating the stable foam, said components being receivable at or in the component receiving portion, at least one of said components being segregated from another of said components by an openable barrier; at least one of the stable-foam-generating components comprising nicotine; an outlet for dispensing the stable foam to the user; a fluid flow path which fluidly communicates the foam-generating-component receiving portion with the outlet so that when the barrier is opened the components interact to generate the stable foam which flows to the outlet via the fluid flow path to be inhaled by the user over a prolonged duration.</p>
<p id="p-0062" num="0061">According to a sixth aspect of the invention, there is provided a cannabis-component inhalation device for dispensing a stable foam to be inhaled by a user over a prolonged duration, the inhalation device comprising: a foam-generating-component receiving portion; a non-electrical inhalation cartridge having stable-foam-generating components for generating the stable foam, said components being receivable at or in the component receiving portion, at least one of said components being segregated from another of said components by an openable barrier; at least one of the stable-foam-generating components comprising a cannabis component; an outlet for dispensing the stable foam to the user; a fluid flow path which fluidly communicates the foam-generating-component receiving portion with the outlet so that when the barrier is opened the components interact to generate the stable foam which flows to the outlet via the fluid flow path to be inhaled by the user over a prolonged duration.</p>
<p id="p-0063" num="0062">According to a seventh aspect of the invention, there is provided a medicine and/or dietary supplement inhalation device for dispensing a stable foam to be inhaled by a user over a prolonged duration, the inhalation device comprising: a foam-generating-component receiving portion; a non-electrical inhalation cartridge having stable-foam-generating components for generating the stable foam, said components being receivable at or in the component receiving portion, at least one of said components being segregated from another of said components by an openable barrier; at least one of the stable-foam-generating components comprising a medicine and/or dietary supplement; an outlet for dispensing the stable foam to the user; a fluid flow path which fluidly communicates the foam-generating-component receiving portion with the outlet so that when the barrier is opened the components interact to generate the stable foam which flows to the outlet via the fluid flow path to be inhaled by the user over a prolonged duration.</p>
<p id="p-0064" num="0063">According to an eighth aspect of the invention, there is provided a food or drink inhalation device for dispensing a stable foam to be inhaled by a user over a prolonged duration, the inhalation device comprising: a foam-generating-component receiving portion; a non-electrical inhalation cartridge having stable-foam-generating components for generating the stable foam, said components being receivable at or in the component receiving portion, at least one of said components being segregated from another of said components by an openable barrier; at least one of the stable-foam-generating components comprising a food or drink supplement; an outlet for dispensing the stable foam to the user; a fluid flow path which fluidly communicates the foam-generating-component receiving portion with the outlet so that when the barrier is opened the components interact to generate the stable foam which flows to the outlet via the fluid flow path to be inhaled by the user over a prolonged duration.</p>
<p id="p-0065" num="0064">According to a ninth aspect of the invention, there is provided an inhalation apparatus for dispensing an inhalant to a user, the apparatus comprising: a component receiving container comprising a flexible material; components for generating an inhalant, said components being receivable at or in the component receiving container, at least one of said components being received within a further container from which said at least one component is dispensable by pressure applied to the further container via flexion; an outlet for dispensing the inhalant to the user; a fluid flow path which fluidly communicates the component receiving container with the outlet so that when said at least one component is dispensed from the further container the components interact to generate the inhalant which flows to the outlet via the fluid flow path to be inhaled by the user.</p>
<p id="p-0066" num="0065">According to an tenth aspect of the invention, there is provided a stable-foam inhalation device for dispensing a stable foam to be inhaled by a user over a prolonged duration, the inhalation device comprising: a cartridge receiving portion; a cartridge receivable in the cartridge receiving portion, the cartridge including at least one chamber for receiving a foam-generating-component and a perforable barrier fluidly communicable with said chamber; a protrusion at or adjacent to the cartridge receiving portion for perforating the barrier; an outlet for dispensing the stable foam to the user; a fluid flow path which fluidly communicates the cartridge receiving portion with the outlet so that when the barrier is perforated by the protrusion the chamber is fluidly communicated with the outlet.</p>
<p id="p-0067" num="0066">According to a eleventh aspect of the invention, there is provided a stable-foam inhalation-device cartridge comprising: a first chamber having an at least in part flexible wall, the first chamber containing a liquid foam-generating component; a second chamber having a further foam-generating component; an openable barrier between the first and second chamber; an outlet communicative with the second chamber for emitting stable foam therefrom; the flexible wall being manipulable to emit the liquid foam-generating component from the first chamber into the second chamber when the barrier is opened so that a stable foam is generated which is dispensable via the outlet.</p>
<p id="p-0068" num="0067">According to a twelfth aspect of the invention, there is provided a stable-foam inhalation-device cartridge comprising: a first chamber having an at least in part flexible wall, the first chamber containing a liquid foam-generating component; a second chamber containing a further foam-generating component; the liquid foam-generating component and the further foam-generating component being interactable to generate a stable foam; and at least one outlet associated with the cartridge for dispensing foam or at least one of the foam-generating components therefrom; the flexible wall being manipulable so that foam or the liquid foam-generating component is emitted from the outlet.</p>
<p id="p-0069" num="0068">According to a thirteenth aspect of the invention, there is provided a liquid emission device comprising: a container with liquid received therein, the container including at least in part flexible wall for applying manual pressure to the liquid; the wall including an opening in the wall for emitting liquid from the container when manual pressure is applied to the liquid, or a perforable portion in which an opening can be formed for emitting liquid from the container when manual pressure is applied to the liquid.</p>
<p id="p-0070" num="0069">According to a fourteenth aspect of the invention there is provided a stable-foam inhalation-device cartridge for a stable-foam inhalation device which dispenses a stable foam to be consumed by a user, the inhalation-device cartridge being devoid of electrical energisation means and comprises: a flexible mixing chamber having a first receiving portion for slidably receiving a first foam-generation element, and a second receiving portion for slidably receiving a second foam-generation element; the flexible mixing chamber having an access opening at a first end and being closed at a second end which is opposite the said first end, the access opening being dimensioned to receive the first and second foam-generation elements therethrough; an expansion chamber which is fluidly-communicable with the access opening of the flexible mixing chamber via a partitioning element, the partitioning element having one or more mixing members for agitating a consumable foam produced by the first and second foam-generation elements as it passes from the mixing chamber to the expansion chamber; and a discharge element which is at or adjacent to one end of the expansion chamber and which has an outlet opening for enabling a user to inhale the consumable foam from the expansion chamber, the discharge element including an inlet opening and a discharge conduit which interconnects the inlet opening with the outlet opening, the discharge conduit having a longitudinal extent which locates the inlet opening at a position closer to the partitioning element than to the outlet opening.</p>
<p id="p-0071" num="0070">A stable foam, as opposed to only a short-lived effervescence and/or a rapidly propelled inhalant, may allow for a user to consume or inhale a substance contained within the foam slowly, over a prolonged duration and with multiple inhalations. This can provide a satisfying and pleasurable experience for the user. The cartridge being devoid of electrical energisation means reduces or eliminates a requirement for electrical charging. The flexible mixing chamber provides a convenient way of activating the foam-generation elements, for example in the instance that the foam-generation elements are manually activatable. The partitioning element spaces or separates the foam-generation elements from the outlet of the cartridge, which allows for the foam to expand into the space therebetween. Such a space is here defined by the expansion chamber. The mixing members or arms of the partitioning element define apertures through which the foam moves. The movement of the foam through the apertures may generate vortices which can help to mix the foam with any unreacted foam-generation elements to improve a consistency of the foam.</p>
<p id="p-0072" num="0071">The discharge element with a discharge conduit allows for foam to be inhaled away from an end of the cartridge. In other words, the foam may be drawn to the outlet from a more central region of the cartridge, which may improve the consistency of foam at the outlet.</p>
<p id="p-0073" num="0072">Although the mixing chamber is described as being flexible, it will be appreciated that this may not be the case. For example, in the instance of non-manual activation means being considered. Additionally or alternatively, it could be envisaged that the mixing chamber may not have an access opening as such, for example if the mixing chamber and the expansion chamber were unitarily formed.</p>
<p id="p-0074" num="0073">The second end of the mixing chamber may be integrally formed with the remainder of the mixing chamber, although it will be appreciated that a separable end cap may be used.</p>
<p id="p-0075" num="0074">Whilst the partitioning element is described, a partitioning element may not be strictly necessary. Alternatively, if a partitioning element is present, a mixing member may not necessarily required.</p>
<p id="p-0076" num="0075">Although a discharge conduit is described for the discharge element, it will be appreciated that this may be omitted. Alternatively, if the discharge conduit is present, it would be understood that the longitudinal extent of the discharge conduit might be such that the inlet opening is closer to the outlet opening than the partitioning element.</p>
<p id="p-0077" num="0076">Although the cartridge is described as being devoid of electrical energisation means, it will be appreciated that this may be included. For example, the cartridge may include an electric motor for agitating a liquid to produce foam, and a battery for energising the electric motor.</p>
<p id="p-0078" num="0077">Whilst the device is described as being for a stable foam, it will be appreciated that the device may be used with other inhalants or consumables.</p>
<p id="p-0079" num="0078">Preferably, the flexible mixing chamber may comprise a thermoplastic elastomer. The thermoplastic elastomer can provide a food safe, durable and sufficiently flexible material for the mixing chamber.</p>
<p id="p-0080" num="0079">Advantageously, the inlet opening may be off-centre relative to the expansion chamber. In a preferable embodiment, the inlet opening may be at or adjacent to a lateral wall of the expansion chamber. Such an arrangement allows for the inlet opening to be at an in use lower position. Therefore, as the foam is consumed and a level of foam reduces in the expansion chamber, a greater total amount of foam can be accessed since the remaining foam would occupy the lower portion of the expansion chamber under gravity.</p>
<p id="p-0081" num="0080">Beneficially, the partitioning element may comprise a stop, the access opening and the expansion chamber being connectable to the partitioning element either side of the stop. This allows for convenient assembly of the cartridge, since the mixing chamber and the expansion chamber can be pushed over sealing surfaces of the partitioning element until the stop is reached.</p>
<p id="p-0082" num="0081">In a preferable embodiment, the stop may be a ridge which extends around the perimeter of the partitioning element.</p>
<p id="p-0083" num="0082">Preferably, the partitioning element comprises an axially extending protrusion which is extendable into the flexible mixing chamber for contacting the first or second foam-generation elements. This may provide a small area of contact on the first or second foam-generation elements which may assist with discharging a liquid therefrom, for example.</p>
<p id="p-0084" num="0083">Optionally, a passageway through the partitioning element may widen from the flexible mixing chamber to the expansion chamber. The widening of the passageway may encourage foam to move from the mixing chamber to the expansion chamber.</p>
<p id="p-0085" num="0084">Additionally, the passageway may be widened via a step. This may permit for convenient manufacture of the widening.</p>
<p id="p-0086" num="0085">Advantageously, the inhalation-device cartridge may further comprise the first and second foam-generation elements.</p>
<p id="p-0087" num="0086">Beneficially, the second foam-generation element may comprise a container of liquid. A liquid allows for dissolving of the first foam-generation element.</p>
<p id="p-0088" num="0087">In a preferable embodiment, the liquid may be water. Water is an ingestible liquid and can be used with a wide variety of container materials. Other solvents may be considered.</p>
<p id="p-0089" num="0088">Additionally, the liquid may be dispensable from the container via manual pressure applied to the container. As such, the user is able to conveniently dispense the liquid from the container without a tool.</p>
<p id="p-0090" num="0089">Optionally, the container may be frangible via said manual pressure. A frangible, breakable, burstable or crushable container allows for the liquid to be dispensed from an otherwise sealed container.</p>
<p id="p-0091" num="0090">Preferably, the container may include a hole in an exterior wall thereof through which the passage of liquid is prevented or limited when manual pressure is not applied to the container, and through which liquid is dispensable when manual pressure is applied to the container. This has the benefit that the container is not required to be broken to dispense liquid therefrom.</p>
<p id="p-0092" num="0091">Advantageously, the container may be oriented so that the hole faces the first foam-generation element. The liquid is therefore dispensed directly onto the first foam-generation element, which may reduce or eliminate a requirement to shake the cartridge to better distribute the liquid, for example.</p>
<p id="p-0093" num="0092">Preferably, the container may comprise a thermoplastic elastomer. The thermoplastic elastomer can provide a food safe, durable and sufficiently flexible material.</p>
<p id="p-0094" num="0093">Advantageously, the first foam generating element comprises a carbonate and an acid. This allows for effervescence by producing carbon dioxide via a chemical reaction. A chemical reaction, as opposed to, for example, releasing a pressurised container, is more convenient for manufacturing purposes.</p>
<p id="p-0095" num="0094">In a preferable embodiment, the carbonate comprises sodium bicarbonate and the acid comprises citric acid. These are two ingestible or food-safe components, although other carbonates and acids may be considered.</p>
<p id="p-0096" num="0095">Beneficially, the first foam generating element comprises a stabiliser. A stabiliser allows for the conversion of an otherwise short-lived effervescence into a stable foam.</p>
<p id="p-0097" num="0096">Optionally, the stabiliser comprises lectin and/or xanthan gum. Other stabilisers or thickeners may also be considered.</p>
<p id="p-0098" num="0097">According to an fifteenth aspect of the invention there is provided a stable-foam inhalation device for dispensing a stable foam to be consumed by a user, the inhalation device comprising the cartridge as claimed in any one of the preceding claims and a carrier, the carrier including: a carrier body; a receiving portion for receiving the cartridge at or in the carrier body; a carrier inlet for fluid communication with the outlet of the discharge element when the carrier is received in or at the receiving portion; a carrier outlet for dispensing a stable foam to a user; and a conduit between the carrier inlet and the carrier outlet through the carrier body.</p>
<p id="p-0099" num="0098">The use of a carrier and a cartridge allows fora disposable cartridge and a reusable carrier. As such, the convenience of a pre-loaded cartridge is provided, without requiring the entire device to be disposable. The carrier can therefore be designed to be large and ergonomic as well as including additional features, without great concern for material waste since the carrier is reusable.</p>
<p id="p-0100" num="0099">It will be appreciated that the discharge conduit of the cartridge may extend through at least part of the holder. In fact, the discharge conduit could extend only through the holder and may not extend through the expansion chamber.</p>
<p id="p-0101" num="0100">Preferably, the stable-foam inhalation device may further comprise a one-way valve in the conduit for permitting movement of foam from the carrier inlet to the carrier outlet and preventing or limiting movement of fluid from the carrier outlet to the carrier inlet. As such, the user can consume or inhale foam whilst being prevented or limited from exhaling into the device and disrupting a foam-distribution therein.</p>
<p id="p-0102" num="0101">Advantageously, the one-way valve may be a duck-bill valve.</p>
<p id="p-0103" num="0102">Beneficially, the stable-foam inhalation device may further comprise an indication element for indicating when foam is being inhaled. This indicates to the user and/or bystanders that the device is in use.</p>
<p id="p-0104" num="0103">Additionally, the indication element may comprise a light-emitting device for lighting when foam is being inhaled. Lighting may be a less intrusive signal as compared to a sound, for example. It will be appreciated that the light-emitting device does not interfere with the main functionality of the inhalation device. In other words, the user can still consume foam whether or not the light is present and operational.</p>
<p id="p-0105" num="0104">Preferably, the indication element may comprise a pressure sensor. This allows for the device to detect when the user is inhaling.</p>
<p id="p-0106" num="0105">Optionally, the pressure sensor may be spaced apart from the conduit, the pressure sensor being in or at a sub-conduit which is fluidly communicable with the conduit. As such, the pressure sensor can be remote from the conduit outlet, which may be convenient for an electrical arrangement of the device.</p>
<p id="p-0107" num="0106">Preferably, the carrier body defines the receiving portion, a part of the carrier body being moveable relative to a remainder of the carrier body for captively holding the cartridge. A moveable part or portion of the carrier body allows for the receiving portion to be changeable in size. In other words, said part can be moved to enlarge or elongate the receiving portion so the cartridge can be positioned therein. The part can then be moved back into position so as to secure the cartridge into position.</p>
<p id="p-0108" num="0107">Advantageously, the stable-foam inhalation device may further comprise a biasing means for biasing said part of the carrier body towards the receiving portion. A biasing means permits for the part to be automatically moved back towards the cartridge and may secure the cartridge in place with a biasing force. This may be advantageous for users with reduced dexterity, for example users with arthritis.</p>
<p id="p-0109" num="0108">Beneficially, the biasing means may be a spring.</p>
<p id="p-0110" num="0109">Optionally, said part may be at or adjacent to the carrier inlet.</p>
<p id="p-0111" num="0110">Preferably, the carrier body may include at least one side wall, the or each side wall including an access opening therein for providing visual or manual access to the cartridge. The access opening can, for example, permit for the cartridge to be directly engaged and moved. This may allow for the foam-generation elements to be manually manipulated through the mixing chamber walls and activated, for example. Furthermore, permitting movement of the cartridge through the access openings may assist with releasing the cartridge from the receiving portion. Alternatively or additionally, the access opening may allow for a visual inspection by the user of the production or level of foam remaining in the cartridge. The use of an access opening permits for access to the cartridge, whilst allowing for the side wall to extend further up the side of the cartridge to more securely laterally hold the cartridge in position. The access opening can also allow for leverage to be applied underneath the cartridge to assist with removal from the receiving portion.</p>
<p id="p-0112" num="0111">Beneficially, the carrier body may have two side walls, each side wall having an access opening therein. Access openings in each side wall can allow for the cartridge to be gripped between fingers.</p>
<p id="p-0113" num="0112">Advantageously, the carrier body and the or each access opening may be elongate, a longitudinal extent of the or each access opening being aligned with that of the carrier body. This may allow for a greater proportion of the cartridge to be visible.</p>
<p id="p-0114" num="0113">Additionally, the access opening may extend towards the biasing means. This can allow for the cartridge to be conveniently moved towards the biasing means.</p>
<p id="p-0115" num="0114">In a preferable embodiment, the or each access opening may be tapered.</p>

<p id="p-0142" num="0141">Advantageously, the conduit of the carrier and the air-flow conduit project into the receiving portion so as to permit perforation of the cartridge foam outlet and the cartridge air inlet respectively.</p>
<p id="p-0143" num="0142">In a preferable embodiment, each seal is flexible so as to seal the cartridge foam outlet to the conduit of the carrier, and so as to seal the cartridge air inlet to the air-flow conduit. This may assist with preventing leaks from the cartridge.</p>
<p id="p-0144" num="0143">Optionally the device may have a cartridge-presence sensor configured to detect when the cartridge is received in the cartridge receiving portion, the agitating means configured to operate only when the cartridge-presence sensor detects the cartridge in the cartridge receiving portion. As such, unintended operation of the agitations means may be prevented or limited which may reduce draining of the battery. Such a sensor may also be termed a switch.</p>
<p id="p-0145" num="0144">Preferably, the liquid may further comprise at least one of nicotine, a component of cannabis, medicines and/or dietary supplements, and a food or drink substance.</p>
<p id="p-0146" num="0145">Preferably, the device is elongate and has a length of 150 mm or less and a width of 50 mm or less. Such a sizing may allow for convenient holding and use of the device, and may provide a more comparable user-experience to cigarette smoking.</p>

<?detailed-description description="Detailed Description" end="lead"?>
<p id="p-0180" num="0179">Referring firstly to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>1</b> to <b>3</b></figref> there is shown a first embodiment of a stable-foam inhalation-device cartridge <b>10</b>. The inhalation-device cartridge <b>10</b> comprises a flexible mixing chamber <b>12</b>, an expansion chamber <b>14</b>, a partitioning element <b>16</b>, and a discharge element <b>18</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0181" num="0180">The flexible mixing chamber <b>12</b> has an access opening <b>20</b> at a first end <b>22</b> and is closed at a second end <b>24</b> which is opposite the first end <b>22</b>. The access opening <b>20</b> is dimensioned to receive first and second foam-generation elements <b>26</b>, <b>28</b> therethrough. The access opening <b>20</b> is circular or substantially circular in shape, although it will be appreciated that other shapes may be considered such as square or triangular. Similarly, the flexible mixing chamber <b>12</b> has a circular cross-section, although other shapes may be considered. Preferably, the second end <b>24</b> is curved such that an end portion associated with the second end <b>24</b> may be considered to be semi-spherical. However, this may not be necessary, and the second end <b>24</b> could be planar or flat.</p>
<p id="p-0182" num="0181">The flexible mixing chamber <b>12</b> has a first receiving portion <b>30</b> for slidably receiving the first foam-generation element <b>26</b>, and a second receiving portion <b>32</b> for slidably receiving the second foam-generation element <b>28</b>. The first receiving portion <b>30</b> is distal to the access opening <b>20</b> as compared to the second receiving portion <b>32</b> and is here at or adjacent to the second end <b>24</b>. The second receiving portion <b>32</b> is at or adjacent to the access opening <b>20</b>. The flexible mixing chamber <b>12</b> is preferably sized so that the first receiving portion <b>30</b> and the second receiving portion <b>32</b> together are defined across a majority of the length of the flexible mixing chamber <b>12</b>, and more preferable are defined across substantially the entire length of the flexible mixing chamber <b>12</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0183" num="0182">The flexible mixing chamber <b>12</b> preferably comprises a thermoplastic elastomer which provides the desired flexibility of the mixing chamber <b>12</b>. However, it will be appreciated that other flexible materials may be considered such as silicone, other elastomeric materials, for example rubber, or other flexible plastics. The flexibility of the mixing chamber <b>12</b> allows for compressive manual actuation or activation of the first and/or second foam-generation elements. However, in the instance of other actuation or activation methods, the mixing chamber <b>12</b> may not necessarily be flexible. The flexible mixing chamber <b>12</b> may preferably be transparent or translucent.</p>
<p id="p-0184" num="0183">The expansion chamber <b>14</b> is preferably cylindrical or substantially cylindrical and may be considered to be a tube. However, other shapes may be considered. For example, the expansion tube may have a cross-sectional shape of that of a flattened circle. In other words, the expansion tube may have an elliptical cross-section. Any other shape may be considered, for example rectangular or triangular. This may similarly apply to the mixing chamber <b>12</b>, partitioning element <b>16</b> and discharge element <b>18</b>. The expansion chamber <b>14</b> preferably has a mixing-chamber proximal opening <b>34</b> and a discharge-element proximal opening <b>36</b>. Here each opening is identical, although it will be appreciated that this may not necessarily be the case. The expansion chamber <b>14</b> is also formed from a flexible material, such as a thermoplastic elastomer, although it will be appreciated that this may not be necessary. The expansion chamber <b>14</b> may preferably be transparent or translucent.</p>
<p id="p-0185" num="0184">The mixing-chamber proximal opening <b>34</b> of the expansion chamber <b>14</b> is fluidly communicable with the access opening <b>20</b> of the flexible mixing chamber <b>12</b> via the partitioning element <b>16</b>. The partitioning element <b>16</b> preferably sealingly connects the expansion chamber <b>14</b> with the flexible mixing chamber <b>12</b>. In other words, the partitioning element <b>16</b> connects and seals the expansion chamber <b>14</b> and the mixing chamber <b>12</b> together to prevent leakage of foam.</p>
<p id="p-0186" num="0185">To achieve the sealing connection, the partitioning element <b>16</b> has mixing-chamber sealing surface <b>38</b> and an expansion-chamber sealing surface <b>40</b>. Preferably each sealing surface <b>38</b>, <b>40</b> is annular or substantially annular. Diameters of the mixing-chamber sealing surface <b>38</b> and an expansion-chamber sealing surface <b>40</b> are similar or identical to the diameters of the access opening <b>20</b> and the mixing-chamber proximal opening <b>34</b> of the expansion chamber <b>14</b> respectively. This is such that the sealing surfaces <b>38</b>, <b>40</b> form an interference fit with the relevant opening and/or end portion of the expansion chamber <b>14</b> or mixing chamber <b>12</b>. This prevents or limits leakage of foam or other components from either chamber. The sealing surfaces <b>38</b>, <b>40</b> are receivable within the respective chamber to abut the inside wall thereof. The access opening <b>20</b> and the mixing-chamber proximal opening <b>34</b> preferably have similar or identical diameters and as such it will be appreciated that either sealing surface could feasibly be used for either opening. However, this may not be the case and the diameters of the access opening <b>20</b> and the opening of the expansion chamber <b>14</b> may be different.</p>
<p id="p-0187" num="0186">The partitioning element <b>16</b> preferably comprises an exterior stop <b>42</b>, the mixing chamber <b>12</b> and the expansion chamber <b>14</b> being connectable to the partitioning element <b>16</b> either side of the stop <b>42</b>. The stop <b>42</b> is here a ridge which extends annularly around a perimeter of the partitioning element <b>16</b> and separates the two sealing surfaces <b>38</b>, <b>40</b> from each other.</p>
<p id="p-0188" num="0187">Referring now to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b></figref>, the partitioning element <b>16</b> further comprises at least one hole <b>44</b> or through-bore for fluidly communicating the expansion chamber <b>14</b> with the access opening <b>20</b>. Preferably, there are two separate holes <b>44</b>, the holes <b>44</b> separated by at least one, and here two, mixing members <b>46</b>. The mixing members <b>46</b> may be considered to be arms. Additionally, the mixing members <b>46</b> may prevent or limit the movement of the foam-generation elements in their initial form from the mixing chamber <b>12</b> to the expansion chamber <b>14</b>. The holes <b>44</b> are preferably curved and/or the openings of the holes <b>44</b> are elongate such that the holes <b>44</b> may be considered to be slots.</p>
<p id="p-0189" num="0188">The partitioning element <b>16</b> may additionally include a protrusion <b>48</b> which may extend axially into the mixing chamber <b>12</b>. One protrusion <b>48</b> is shown, although it will be anticipated that multiple protrusions <b>48</b> may be considered. Additionally, the protrusion <b>48</b> is shown to be central on the partitioning element <b>16</b>, although it will be appreciated that it may be off-centre. The protrusion is preferably tapered or pointed. In some instances a side wall of the mixing chamber could also include a protrusion.</p>
<p id="p-0190" num="0189">Referring again to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>1</b> and <b>2</b></figref> a passageway <b>50</b>, at least in part defined by the holes <b>44</b>, through the partitioning element <b>16</b> widens from the mixing-chamber sealing surface <b>38</b> to the expansion-chamber sealing surface <b>40</b>. This widening of the passageway <b>50</b> is preferably abrupt, for example being formed by a step <b>52</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0191" num="0190">The discharge element <b>18</b> is at or adjacent to one end of the expansion chamber <b>14</b> and has an outlet opening <b>54</b> for dispensing or discharging foam therefrom. The discharge element <b>18</b> here closes the discharge-element proximal opening <b>36</b> at said end of the expansion chamber <b>14</b>. As such, the discharge element <b>18</b> includes a sealing surface <b>56</b> which connects with and seals the expansion chamber <b>14</b> in the same or a similar way as the sealing surfaces of the partitioning element <b>16</b>. The sealing surface <b>56</b> of the discharge element <b>18</b> is therefore annular, has a diameter which is similar or identical to that of the proximal opening of the expansion chamber <b>14</b> and is receivable therein. The discharge element <b>18</b> further includes a stop <b>58</b> to prevent over-insertion of the discharge element <b>18</b> into the expansion chamber <b>14</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0192" num="0191">An interior surface <b>60</b> of the discharge element <b>18</b> is concave or substantially concave which may assist with redirecting foam. An exterior surface <b>62</b> of the discharge element <b>18</b> is convex.</p>
<p id="p-0193" num="0192">The outlet opening <b>54</b> preferably protrudes and/or is separated from the exterior surface of a body of the discharge element <b>18</b>. The outlet opening <b>54</b> is off-centre relative to the remainder of the discharge element <b>18</b>, being at or adjacent to an in use lower portion of the discharge element <b>18</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0194" num="0193">The discharge element <b>18</b> further includes a discharge conduit <b>64</b> and an inlet opening <b>66</b>, the discharge conduit <b>64</b> interconnects the inlet opening <b>66</b> and the outlet opening <b>54</b> so that they are in fluid communication. The discharge conduit <b>64</b> has a longitudinal extent which locates the inlet opening <b>66</b> at a position closer to the partitioning element <b>16</b> than to the outlet opening <b>54</b>. Additionally, the inlet opening <b>66</b> is located off-centre relative to the remainder of the discharge element <b>18</b> and/or the expansion chamber <b>14</b>. In use, the inlet opening <b>66</b> is preferably at or adjacent to a lower interior surface of the expansion chamber <b>14</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0195" num="0194">The flexible mixing chamber <b>12</b> includes first and second foam-generation elements <b>26</b>, <b>28</b>. These are positioned inside the mixing chamber <b>12</b> in the corresponding receiving portions <b>30</b>, <b>32</b>. With the foam-generation elements <b>26</b>, <b>28</b> received therein, the partitioning element <b>16</b> is connected to the mixing chamber <b>12</b>, the expansion chamber <b>14</b> is connected to the partitioning element <b>16</b> and the discharge element <b>18</b> is connected to the expansion chamber <b>14</b>. These parts may be adhered together to prevent disassembly or separation. Additionally, it will be appreciated that two or more of the parts may be unitarily formed together.</p>
<p id="p-0196" num="0195">When the substances which comprise the first and second foam-generation elements <b>26</b>, <b>28</b> are reacted or interacted together they produce a stable foam. This is preferably achieved by effervescence which is stabilised and/or thickened into a foam.</p>
<p id="p-0197" num="0196">For example, the first foam-generation element <b>26</b> comprises a carbonate, for example sodium bicarbonate, and an acid, for example citric acid. Although sodium bicarbonate and citric acid are preferred, it will be appreciated that any other ingestible or food safe carbonate, for example calcium carbonate, or acid, for example tartaric acid, may be considered. The carbonate and the acid are here in solid form, for example being powdered and compressed into the first foam-generating element. The first foam-generating element may therefore be considered to be a tablet or pill, although it will be appreciated that it may be uncompressed and simply be a powder. In the solid form, the carbonate and acid do not react. The first foam-generation element <b>26</b> further comprises a stabiliser and/or thickener. Here stabilisers and/or thickeners such as lecithin and xanthan gum are used; however, any thickening or stabilising agent may be considered.</p>
<p id="p-0198" num="0197">The cross-sections of each of the first and second foam-generation elements <b>26</b>, <b>28</b> are preferably circular so as to correspond to the cross-section of the flexible mixing chamber.</p>
<p id="p-0199" num="0198">Referring in particular to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>6</b></figref>, the second foam-generation element <b>28</b> preferably comprises a container <b>68</b> of liquid. For example, here the second container <b>68</b> comprises a container <b>68</b> of water, although other liquids may be considered. The water may include a colourant which may assist with visual identification thereof. The container <b>68</b> is hollow, sealed and preferably has curvate ends, for example here a longitudinal cross-section of the container <b>68</b> has a stadium shape. However, other shapes may be considered, such as a ball shape. In fact, a container <b>68</b> as such may not be used and the liquid and the first foam-generation element <b>26</b> may be separated or segregated by a planar seal.</p>
<p id="p-0200" num="0199">The container <b>68</b> is preferably flexible, and may be formed from a thermoplastic elastomer although other flexible materials may be considered as before. In the instance of a flexible container, the container <b>68</b> preferably includes a hole <b>70</b> therein, the hole <b>70</b> allowing for the liquid to be ejected therefrom when the container <b>68</b> is squeezed. The hole <b>70</b> is preferably small, such that when pressure is not applied the surface tension of the liquid maintains the liquid in the container <b>68</b>. For example, the diameter of the hole <b>70</b> may be between 0 mm and 1 mm, and may more preferably be substantially 0.5 mm, for example being 0.45 mm. The flexible container <b>68</b> with a hole <b>70</b> therein is preferably referred to as a squeeze ball. The hole <b>70</b> is ideally in an end of the container and is oriented so as to face the first foam-generation element <b>26</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0201" num="0200">However, the container <b>68</b> may not be flexible and may be rigid. In the instance of a rigid or inflexible container <b>68</b>, at least part of the container <b>68</b> is preferably frangible via manual pressure applied thereto and may be burstable or crushable. Breaking of at least part of the container <b>68</b> may release fluid therefrom. In the instance that the container <b>68</b> is rigid, the hole <b>70</b> therein may still be present, although it will be appreciated that this may not be necessary.</p>
<p id="p-0202" num="0201">Although the liquid preferably comprises, consists or consists essentially of water, it will be appreciated that the liquid may instead be an acidic solution or a carbonate solution, and the first foam-generation element <b>26</b> may lack the acid or the carbonate.</p>
<p id="p-0203" num="0202">The first and/or second foam-generation elements <b>26</b>, <b>28</b> may include additional components which a user may wish to consume or inhale. In particular, the first and/or second foam-generation elements <b>26</b>, <b>28</b> could include flavourings to improve a user-experience. Further additional components are discussed below.</p>
<p id="p-0204" num="0203">For example, the first and/or second foam-generation elements <b>26</b>, <b>28</b> may include pharmaceuticals, medicines and/or dietary supplements. This may include vitamins, exercise supplements such as pre-workout compositions, branched-chain amino acids, creatine, other supplements usually taken during a workout for endurance, over-the-counter style medicines such as cough or pain remedies and/or erectile dysfunction medicine such as sildenafil. Compounds which are taken in small doses to be ingested as and when needed are of particular relevance.</p>
<p id="p-0205" num="0204">The first and/or second foam-generation elements <b>26</b>, <b>28</b> may include a food or beverage substance, or a compound thereof. This may include flavourings or components of soft drinks, for example electrolyte type sports drinks or iced tea, both of which can conventionally be found in powdered form. Alcoholic drinks may be considered, and in this case alcohol could be used as the liquid in the container <b>68</b>. Flavourings or components of confectionary or desserts may also be considered, which may allow a user to experience a confectionary or dessert without consuming the number of calories typically associated therewith. The first and/or second foam-generation elements <b>26</b>, <b>28</b> may include caffeine, for example a total caffeine content of the first and/or second foam-generation elements <b>26</b>, <b>28</b> being substantially equivalent to a conventional espresso shot.</p>
<p id="p-0206" num="0205">The first and/or second foam-generation elements <b>26</b>, <b>28</b> may include nicotine and therefore may provide an alternative to smoking. The first and/or second foam-generation elements <b>26</b>, <b>28</b> may also include other components of tobacco or tobacco itself.</p>
<p id="p-0207" num="0206">The first and/or second foam-generation elements <b>26</b>, <b>28</b> could include cannabis or components of cannabis, for example including tetrahydrocannabinol (THC) and/or cannabidiol (CBD) to provide psychoactive and/or medicinal effects as desired. Although cannabis is described in this specification, in view of the different legal and moral statuses of cannabis worldwide, it will be appreciated that reference to cannabis and/or components thereof may be deleted from the specification if necessary.</p>
<p id="p-0208" num="0207">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>6</b> and <b>7</b></figref>, the cartridge <b>10</b> is received in a first embodiment carrier <b>72</b> or holder to form the first embodiment of an inhalation device <b>74</b>. The carrier <b>72</b> comprises a carrier body <b>76</b>, a cartridge receiving portion <b>78</b> for receiving the cartridge <b>10</b> at or in the carrier body <b>76</b>, a carrier foam inlet <b>80</b>, a carrier outlet <b>82</b> and a passageway <b>84</b> or conduit between the carrier foam inlet <b>80</b> and the carrier outlet <b>82</b> through the carrier body <b>76</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0209" num="0208">The cartridge receiving portion <b>78</b> is here a hole <b>44</b> or recess in the carrier body <b>76</b> and is sized to captively hold the cartridge <b>10</b>. A rear part <b>86</b> of the carrier body <b>76</b> is removably attachable to the remainder of the carrier body <b>76</b> so as to allow insertion of the cartridge <b>10</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0210" num="0209">The outlet opening <b>54</b> of the cartridge <b>10</b> is fluidly communicable with the carrier foam inlet <b>80</b> of the carrier <b>72</b>, and may be insertable therein. The carrier foam inlet <b>80</b> includes a seal <b>88</b> for sealing the outlet opening <b>54</b> of the cartridge <b>10</b> thereto. The seal <b>88</b> is preferably an O-ring, and may be elastomeric.</p>
<p id="p-0211" num="0210">At or adjacent to the carrier foam inlet <b>80</b> is a carrier air inlet <b>90</b>. The air inlet <b>90</b> allows for the addition of air to or the entrainment of air with the foam. The air inlet <b>90</b> is preferably a channel or conduit through the carrier body <b>76</b> to the exterior of the device. Alternatively, the air inlet <b>90</b> might feasibly be or communicable with a void in the carrier body <b>76</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0212" num="0211">A venturi tube <b>92</b> is preferably fluidly communicable with the carrier foam inlet <b>80</b> and is preferably also fluidly communicable with the carrier air inlet <b>90</b>. The venturi tube <b>92</b> has a rear opening which is communicable with both inlets <b>80</b>, <b>92</b>. A passageway through the tube <b>92</b> may taper to increase a speed of flow of fluid therethrough, although it will be appreciated that this may not be strictly necessary. A head portion of the venturi tube <b>92</b> has a tapered and preferably frusto-conical shape. The venturi tube <b>92</b> may help to mix the foam and the air together.</p>
<p id="p-0213" num="0212">The carrier <b>72</b> further includes a one-way valve <b>96</b> between the carrier foam inlet <b>80</b> and a carrier outlet <b>82</b>. The one-way valve <b>96</b> is arranged to prevent a user from exhaling into the cartridge <b>10</b> or device and disrupting a foam distribution therein. The one-way valve <b>96</b> is preferably a duck-bill valve <b>96</b>. The duck-bill valve <b>96</b> comprises a flexible material and is conical or substantially conical in shape, having an opening <b>98</b> at a base. The valve <b>96</b> includes a cut <b>100</b> part of the way along a body of the valve <b>96</b> from the tip or forward part of valve <b>96</b>. The cut <b>100</b> allows for fluid to flow from the base and out of the tip. This is since the portions of the body demarcated by the cut <b>100</b> separate from each other to create a forward opening in the valve <b>96</b> when under outward-pressure from the interior of the of the body of the valve. When a tip portion <b>104</b> is under inward pressure from the exterior of the body of the valve, the portions of the body demarcated by the cut <b>100</b> remain in contact to prevent fluid flow therethrough.</p>
<p id="p-0214" num="0213">The tapered end of the venturi tube <b>92</b> is preferably received through the opening <b>98</b> in the base of the one-way valve <b>96</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0215" num="0214">A front part <b>106</b> of the carrier body <b>76</b> is preferably removable from the remainder of the body <b>76</b> and/or a central part <b>108</b> of the carrier body <b>76</b>, for example to assist with cleaning. The front part <b>106</b> could include the one-way valve <b>96</b> and/or the venturi tube <b>92</b>, although this is not the case as shown. The front part <b>106</b> and/or the central part <b>108</b> of the carrier body <b>76</b> may include magnetic elements to allow for convenient detachable attachment therebetween. The carrier <b>72</b> may also include a sealing element between the front part <b>106</b> and the central part <b>108</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0216" num="0215">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>8</b> to <b>10</b></figref> in particular, the inhalation device <b>74</b> may also include an indication or signalling means or element <b>110</b> for indicating or signalling when a user is inhaling from the inhalation device <b>74</b>. The indication element <b>110</b> may include a pressure or flow sensor <b>112</b> for detecting when negative pressure is applied thereto. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>8</b></figref>, a conduit <b>114</b>, sub conduit or channel extends from the passageway <b>84</b> between the carrier foam inlet <b>80</b> and the carrier outlet <b>82</b> to the flow sensor <b>112</b>. The flow sensor <b>112</b> is preferably positioned in or at the rear part <b>86</b> of the carrier <b>72</b>. However, in some instances the pressure sensor <b>112</b> may be directly at or in the passageway.</p>
<p id="p-0217" num="0216">The indication element <b>110</b> further includes a light-emitting device <b>116</b>, such as a light emitting diode, which is configured to light when a negative pressure is sensed by the pressure sensor <b>112</b>. The light-emitting device <b>116</b> is preferably positioned within the carrier body <b>76</b> and at or adjacent to the cartridge <b>10</b>. For example, being at or adjacent to a central region of the cartridge receiving portion <b>78</b> of the carrier <b>72</b>. To accommodate the light-emitting device <b>116</b> in this position, the rear carrier part <b>86</b> may include a projecting portion <b>118</b> which projects from a body portion of the rear carrier part <b>86</b> and supports the light-emitting device <b>116</b> and wiring or an electrical track. The central part <b>108</b> of the carrier <b>72</b> may include a hole for receiving the projecting portion <b>118</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0218" num="0217">The light-emitting device <b>116</b> is electrically, electronically or communicatively connected with the pressure sensor <b>112</b>. The indication element <b>110</b> may include a controller configured to determine when the flow sensor <b>112</b> measures a negative pressure and then instruct the light-emitting device <b>116</b> to illuminate.</p>
<p id="p-0219" num="0218">The indication element <b>110</b> preferably includes a battery to power the light-emitting device <b>116</b>, pressure sensor <b>112</b>, and controller if present. The battery is preferably a rechargeable battery and the carrier <b>72</b> includes an electrical terminal <b>120</b> for recharging the battery.</p>
<p id="p-0220" num="0219">It will be appreciated that the indication element <b>110</b> may not be essential for the device to dispense foam and so may not be included. As such, for the purpose of dispensing foam, the device is devoid of electrical components and/or is non-electrically-energisable.</p>
<p id="p-0221" num="0220">Referring in particular to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>10</b></figref>, the rear carrier part <b>86</b> preferably includes part of the cartridge receiving portion <b>78</b>. The rear carrier part <b>86</b> may include at least one magnetic element <b>122</b> for releasably coupling with magnetic elements on the central part <b>108</b> of the carrier body <b>76</b>. This may allow for the rear part <b>86</b> to be conveniently detachably attachable to the central part <b>108</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0222" num="0221">In use, the cartridge receiving portion <b>78</b> is opened by removing the rear carrier part <b>86</b>. The cartridge <b>10</b> is positioned in the cartridge receiving portion <b>78</b> and the cartridge receiving portion <b>78</b> is closed by reattaching the rear carrier part <b>86</b>. When in the cartridge receiving portion <b>78</b>, the outlet opening <b>54</b> of the discharge element <b>18</b> is inserted or connected with the carrier foam inlet <b>80</b> of the carrier <b>72</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0223" num="0222">A user may then apply pressure to the flexible mixing chamber <b>12</b> over the second foam-generation element <b>28</b>. The flexible mixing chamber <b>12</b> thus deforms and causes pressure to be applied to the second foam generation element <b>28</b> which causes liquid to be ejected or dispensed from the container <b>68</b> via the hole <b>44</b>. The protrusion <b>48</b> of the partitioning element <b>16</b> may assist with ejecting liquid from the container <b>68</b>, since it may limit the container <b>68</b> from deforming in a direction towards the partitioning element <b>16</b>. A point pressure applied by the protrusion <b>48</b> may cause additional pressure on the container <b>68</b> to encourage dispensation of the liquid.</p>
<p id="p-0224" num="0223">The liquid causes the components or chemicals in the first foam-generation element <b>26</b> to dissolve. The carbonate and the acid are thus able to react to produce carbon dioxide and thereby effervesce. This effervescence, which would otherwise be short-lived, is stabilised into a stable foam by the stabiliser. The foam is thickened by the thickener.</p>
<p id="p-0225" num="0224">Although a stabiliser for stabilising carbon dioxide bubbles is preferred for forming a stable foam, it will be appreciated that other methods may be utilised for forming a stable foam. For example, nitrogen gas may be utilised to generate a small bubble size which may be more stable than a conventional carbon dioxide bubble. Although a chemical reaction is described as producing the effervescence and foam, it will be appreciated that other methods of effervescence or foam generation may be considered. For example, a pressurised container <b>68</b> of gas may be released, or a liquid may be agitated to produce a foam.</p>
<p id="p-0226" num="0225">As the foam is generated it may move out of the mixing chamber <b>12</b> and into the expansion chamber <b>14</b> where expansion of the foam is accommodated. The mixing arms of the partitioning element <b>16</b> mix the foam as it passes the partitioning element <b>16</b>. This mixing is accomplished by the mixing arms generating a vortex in the foam as the foam passes through the apertures defined by the mixing arms. The mixing assists with dissolving the first foam-generation element <b>26</b> and therefore can prevent or limit powder from being inhaled.</p>
<p id="p-0227" num="0226">The user may then inhale from or at the carrier outlet <b>82</b>. The negative pressure or suction applied by the inhalation causes the duck-bill valve <b>96</b> to open and foam is drawn from the expansion chamber <b>14</b>, along the discharge conduit <b>64</b> and into the carrier foam inlet <b>80</b>. The foam is mixed with air which is drawn through the carrier air inlet <b>90</b>. The foam and air mix passes through the venturi tube <b>92</b>, through the open duck-bill valve <b>96</b> and into the user's mouth via the carrier outlet <b>82</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0228" num="0227">The user only inhales part of the foam with a single inhalation. Since the foam is stable, the foam may be inhaled multiple times over a prolonged duration. For example, the foam is stable or present for between 15 and 30 minutes and allows fora plurality of inhalations of foam, for example substantially 50 inhalations.</p>
<p id="p-0229" num="0228">When the user inhales from the carrier outlet <b>82</b>, this causes a negative pressure to act on the pressure sensor <b>112</b> which triggers the illumination of the light-emitting device <b>116</b>. This provides an indication to the user and/or others that the device is being used.</p>
<p id="p-0230" num="0229">Once the foam has been utilised or dispensed, the user may remove the cartridge <b>10</b> by detaching the rear carrier part <b>86</b>. A new cartridge <b>10</b> may then be inserted into the cartridge receiving portion <b>78</b> as required.</p>
<p id="p-0231" num="0230">Referring now to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>11</b> to <b>13</b></figref>, there is shown a second embodiment of a carrier <b>272</b> of a stable foam inhalation device. A cartridge, such as that previously described, is receivable in the carrier <b>272</b> to form the inhalation device. Similar or identical reference numerals are used as for the first embodiment, with <b>200</b> added. The second embodiment of the carrier <b>272</b> is preferably similar to the first embodiment <b>72</b> and has at least some similar or identical features.</p>
<p id="p-0232" num="0231">The carrier body <b>276</b> of the second embodiment of the carrier <b>272</b> includes a moveable part <b>324</b> or portion at or adjacent to the cartridge receiving portion <b>278</b>, and at or adjacent to the carrier foam inlet <b>280</b>. An edge of the moveable part <b>324</b> may define part of the receiving portion <b>278</b>. The moveable part <b>324</b> is preferably moveable so as to be received further towards the carrier outlet <b>282</b>, and therefore away from a centre of the receiving portion <b>278</b>. This would enlarge or elongate the receiving portion <b>278</b>. The carrier body <b>276</b> may include grooves and/or a recess to accommodate the movement of the moveable part <b>324</b> towards the carrier outlet <b>282</b>. However, it will be appreciated that the moveable part may be at another location at or adjacent to the receiving portion, for example being adjacent to a rear end of the carrier body. In this case, the moveable part would be moveable towards the rear end, and so away from the centre of the receiving portion.</p>
<p id="p-0233" num="0232">The moveable part <b>324</b> is preferably biased towards the receiving portion <b>278</b> via a biasing means. This may be achieved via the use of a spring. For example, a coil spring may be mounted between the moveable part <b>324</b> and a remainder of the carrier body <b>276</b> which forces the moveable part <b>324</b> towards the receiving portion <b>278</b>. The carrier body <b>276</b> may include a stop for the moveable part <b>324</b> to maintain the position of the moveable part <b>324</b> when the cartridge is not received in the receiving portion <b>278</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0234" num="0233">The moveable part <b>324</b> may include an opening <b>326</b> therein to correspond and connect with the cartridge outlet. The opening <b>326</b> in the moveable part <b>324</b> may in fact define the carrier foam inlet <b>280</b>. Alternatively, the cartridge outlet may be received under the moveable part with the carrier foam inlet positioned similarly under or below the moveable part.</p>
<p id="p-0235" num="0234">The moveable part <b>324</b> preferably includes a concave surface <b>328</b> which corresponds to a shape of the expansion chamber of the cartridge.</p>
<p id="p-0236" num="0235">The use of a moveable part <b>324</b> may have the result that a removable rear part <b>286</b>, as described for the first embodiment, is not necessary, since the capsule can be inserted without removing part of the carrier body <b>276</b>. However, it will be appreciated that a removable rear part may still be used if so required to enhance convenience of use.</p>
<p id="p-0237" num="0236">The carrier body <b>276</b> preferably includes side walls <b>330</b> at or adjacent to the receiving portion <b>278</b>. At least one of the side walls <b>330</b>, and preferably both side walls <b>330</b>, have an access opening <b>332</b> therein. The access openings <b>332</b> are elongate and are aligned with a longitudinal direction of the carrier body <b>276</b>. The access openings <b>332</b> extend towards the movable part <b>324</b>. This may allow for the cartridge, when received in the receiving portion <b>278</b>, to be moved by the user's fingers towards the movable part <b>324</b>, which permits release of the cartridge.</p>
<p id="p-0238" num="0237">The access openings <b>332</b> are tapered, having a larger portion of the opening proximal to a rear part <b>286</b> or portion of the carrier body <b>276</b>. The larger portion of the opening <b>332</b> being proximal to the rear part <b>286</b> allows for manual pressure to be more easily applied to the foam-generation elements so as to activate them and/or allows greater leverage to be applied to the cartridge from beneath to assist with removal.</p>
<p id="p-0239" num="0238">It will be appreciated that the carrier body <b>276</b> may define a space, void or gap <b>334</b> open to the access openings <b>332</b> beneath the cartridge when received in the receiving portion <b>278</b>. Such a space or gap <b>334</b> may be understood with respect to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>13</b></figref> which shows a curved portion <b>336</b> or seat where the second end of the mixing chamber may be received. It will be appreciated that the space or gap <b>334</b> may be defined below a line which extends from the seat or curved portion <b>336</b> to the carrier foam inlet <b>280</b>. The gap or space <b>334</b> may assist with removal of the cartridge, for example allowing leverage to be applied underneath the cartridge. The second embodiment of the carrier <b>272</b> may be used in a similar or identical way as the first embodiment of the carrier <b>72</b> with the exception of insertion and removal of the cartridge, and the location of the application of manual pressure which is applied to the foam generation elements. The moveable part <b>324</b> is moved towards the carrier outlet <b>282</b>, in the direction of block arrow A, to enlarge the receiving portion <b>278</b>. The moveable part <b>324</b> may be moved via being pushed with the cartridge, for example. The cartridge is then positioned in the receiving portion <b>278</b> and the moveable part <b>324</b>, under influence from the biasing means, moves towards its original position which may hold the cartridge in place.</p>
<p id="p-0240" num="0239">The foam generation elements may be activated via applying manual pressure to the mixing chamber via the access openings <b>332</b>. Foam is then generated and inhaled in the same or similar way as previously described.</p>
<p id="p-0241" num="0240">After use, the cartridge can be moved towards the carrier outlet <b>282</b>, via gripping the cartridge via the access openings <b>332</b>, to move the moveable part <b>324</b> so as to enlarge the receiving portion <b>278</b>. The cartridge can then be removed from the receiving portion <b>278</b>, applying leverage to the cartridge via the gap <b>334</b> if required.</p>
<p id="p-0242" num="0241">Although access openings are described, it will be appreciated that an upper wall or rib which defines the recess may not be included, and the opening may instead be a cut-away portion.</p>
<p id="p-0243" num="0242">Although the second embodiment describes access openings and the moveable part, it will be appreciated that either or both features may be omitted.</p>
<p id="p-0244" num="0243">Referring now to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>14</b> to <b>17</b></figref>, there is shown a third embodiment of a stable-foam inhalation device <b>474</b>. Similar or identical reference numerals are used as for the first or second embodiments, with <b>400</b> or <b>200</b> added respectively.</p>
<p id="p-0245" num="0244">The third embodiment <b>474</b> has similar features to the first and second embodiments <b>74</b> and the description of those similar features of the first and second embodiments may be considered to be relevant for the third embodiment.</p>
<p id="p-0246" num="0245">The third embodiment of the stable-foam inhalation device <b>474</b> comprises a carrier <b>472</b> and a cartridge <b>410</b>, the cartridge <b>410</b> receivable by the carrier <b>474</b>. The carrier <b>410</b> includes a cartridge-receiving portion <b>478</b> for receiving the cartridge <b>410</b>, and said cartridge-receiving portion <b>478</b> may be considered to be a foam-generating-component receiving portion of the carrier <b>472</b>. The carrier <b>472</b> further includes an outlet <b>482</b> for dispensing stable foam from the device <b>474</b> to be consumed or inhaled by a user.</p>
<p id="p-0247" num="0246">The cartridge <b>410</b> is preferably non-electrical in that it comprises no electrical components to achieve its main function of dispensing a stable foam or stable-foam-generating components. However, the cartridge <b>410</b> may include electrical components for auxiliary functions, such as lighting or similar.</p>
<p id="p-0248" num="0247">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>15</b> and <b>16</b></figref>, the cartridge <b>410</b> comprises foam-generation elements <b>426</b>, <b>428</b> or components. Here there are two foam-generation elements <b>426</b>, <b>428</b> or components which when combined interact to form a stable foam. The first foam-generation element <b>426</b> comprises a powder or tablet of an acid and a carbonate as previously described. The second foam-generation element <b>428</b> comprises a liquid such as water or another solvent as previously described. However, it will be appreciated that the foam-generation elements may differ as described for previous embodiments.</p>
<p id="p-0249" num="0248">The foam-generation elements <b>426</b>, <b>428</b> are received in separate chambers <b>412</b>, <b>468</b> or containers of the cartridge <b>410</b> with an openable barrier therebetween to prevent or limit the foam-generation elements <b>426</b>, <b>428</b> from mixing or interacting until desired. The powder <b>426</b> is received in a first chamber <b>412</b>, and the liquid is received in a second chamber <b>468</b>. The first and second chambers <b>412</b>, <b>468</b> may be considered to be a foam-generating-component receiving portion of the cartridge <b>410</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0250" num="0249">The second chamber <b>468</b> comprises a tube with an open end <b>538</b> and a closed end <b>540</b>. At least a portion of a wall of the second chamber <b>468</b> comprises a flexible material to allow for manual application of pressure to the liquid received in the chamber <b>468</b>. The first chamber <b>412</b> is preferably configured to seal or close the open end <b>538</b> of the second chamber <b>468</b>. Here the first chamber <b>412</b> is receivable at least in part inside the second chamber <b>468</b>, although it will be appreciated that this might not be the case. The first chamber <b>412</b> preferably includes a stop <b>542</b>, which is here a flange, which has a diameter which matches or is larger than a diameter of the opening of the open end <b>538</b> of the second chamber <b>468</b> to prevent or limit over-insertion of the first chamber <b>412</b> in the second chamber <b>468</b>. The flange <b>542</b> may provide bracing or support to the first chamber <b>412</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0251" num="0250">The first chamber <b>412</b> includes a perforable wall <b>544</b>, <b>546</b> or seal at each end. The seals are each preferably planar. At a first end, which forms the openable barrier <b>544</b> between the foam-generation elements <b>426</b>, <b>428</b>, a first perforable wall <b>544</b> preferably comprises a foil, such as a metal foil for example aluminium foil. However, other materials, sheets or membranes may be considered for the first perforable wall. The metal foil <b>544</b> may provide a suitable seal and therefore provides a long storage life for the cartridge.</p>
<p id="p-0252" num="0251">At a second end of the first chamber <b>412</b>, which may form a barrier between the cartridge <b>410</b> and the carrier <b>472</b>, a second perforable wall <b>546</b> may comprise a flexible sheet or membrane, such as a sheet of food-grade silicone. However, other materials, sheets or foils may be considered and it may not be flexible. It will be appreciated that a seal at the second end of the first chamber may not be strictly necessary, in the instance of the first foam-generation component being a tablet for example. However, the second perforable wall <b>546</b> may assist with providing a long storage life for the cartridge <b>410</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0253" num="0252">The second perforable wall <b>546</b> preferably only forms a portion of the second end of the first chamber <b>412</b>, which may assist with maintaining a structural integrity of the first chamber and the cartridge since a more rigid material or construction can be used for the remainder of the second end. However, it will be appreciated that the entire second end may be perforable in some configurations. The second perforable wall <b>546</b> may be a separate sheet of material to the remainder of the second end, although alternatively the second perforable wall <b>546</b> may simply be an area of the second end with a smaller wall thickness to assist with perforation.</p>
<p id="p-0254" num="0253">The second perforable wall <b>546</b> is preferably elongate, the reasons for which will be better understood hereinbelow.</p>
<p id="p-0255" num="0254">Referring now to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>17</b></figref>, the cartridge-receiving portion <b>478</b> is preferably at or adjacent to a rear of the carrier <b>472</b>, and may be an opening or recess of the carrier <b>472</b>. The recess <b>478</b> may be sized to receive at least a majority of the cartridge <b>410</b> inserted therein. The cartridge-receiving portion <b>478</b> includes a wall <b>548</b> to prevent over-insertion of the cartridge <b>410</b> into the carrier <b>472</b>. The cartridge <b>410</b> preferably closes the opening of the cartridge-receiving portion <b>478</b> to prevent the egress of foam therefrom.</p>
<p id="p-0256" num="0255">At or adjacent to the cartridge-receiving portion <b>478</b>, and here projecting from said wall <b>548</b>, is at least one, and preferably two, projections or protrusions <b>448</b><i>a</i>, <b>448</b><i>b</i>. The protrusions <b>448</b><i>a</i>, <b>448</b><i>b </i>are configured to perforate the first and/or second perforable walls <b>544</b>, <b>546</b> of the cartridge <b>410</b> when received in the carrier <b>472</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0257" num="0256">The protrusions <b>448</b><i>a</i>, <b>448</b><i>b </i>may be pointed to assist with perforation of the perforable walls, however, it will be appreciated that this may not be necessary. Each protrusion <b>448</b><i>a</i>, <b>448</b><i>b </i>preferably also includes a passageway to assist with permitting fluid to flow through the perforation made in the perforable wall <b>544</b>, <b>546</b> by the protrusion <b>448</b><i>a</i>, <b>448</b><i>b. </i></p>
<p id="p-0258" num="0257">The two protrusions <b>448</b><i>a</i>, <b>448</b><i>b </i>are spaced apart from each other. A first protrusion <b>448</b><i>a </i>projects from a lower portion of the wall <b>548</b> and a second protrusion <b>448</b><i>b </i>projects from an upper portion of the wall <b>548</b>. The spacing of the protrusions <b>448</b><i>a</i>, <b>448</b><i>b </i>may assist with suitable mixing between the foam-generation elements or components <b>426</b>, <b>428</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0259" num="0258">The first protrusion <b>448</b><i>a </i>has a longer projecting extent than that of the second protrusion <b>448</b><i>b</i>. As such, the first protrusion <b>448</b><i>a </i>is configured to extend through the first chamber <b>412</b>, via a lower portion of the elongate second perforable wall <b>546</b>, and through the first perforable wall <b>544</b>. The first protrusion <b>448</b><i>a </i>defines an open-top channel <b>550</b> to prevent the perforation in the first perforable wall <b>544</b> being blocked by the first protrusion <b>448</b><i>a. </i></p>
<p id="p-0260" num="0259">The second protrusion <b>448</b><i>b </i>is configured to extend part way into the first chamber <b>412</b>. The second protrusion <b>448</b><i>b </i>includes a bore <b>552</b> to permit foam to flow or expand therethrough. The bore <b>552</b> extends through the second perforable wall <b>546</b>. The second protrusion <b>448</b><i>b </i>has a larger diameter than that of the first protrusion <b>448</b><i>a</i>, which may be beneficial for permitting the passage of foam therethrough.</p>
<p id="p-0261" num="0260">The carrier <b>472</b> preferably includes an expansion chamber <b>414</b> and a conduit <b>484</b> which are preferably between the cartridge-receiving portion <b>478</b> and the outlet <b>482</b>. Together, the expansion chamber <b>414</b> and conduit <b>484</b> may be considered passageway or fluid flow path between the cartridge-receiving portion <b>478</b> and the outlet <b>482</b>. The expansion chamber <b>414</b> is preferably at or adjacent to the receiving portion <b>478</b> and the bore <b>552</b> of the second protrusion <b>448</b><i>b</i>. The bore <b>552</b> may have a widening <b>554</b> at an end which is at or adjacent to expansion chamber <b>414</b> which may encourage foam therein. The expansion chamber <b>414</b> is so called since it provides space for the foam to expand into.</p>
<p id="p-0262" num="0261">The expansion chamber <b>414</b> may be transparent to allow for the foam to be visible during use. However, it will be appreciated that this may not be necessary. The expansion chamber <b>414</b> may be flexible to allow for manual manipulation thereof, although, again, it will be appreciated that this may not be necessary.</p>
<p id="p-0263" num="0262">The conduit <b>484</b> preferably extends from the outlet <b>482</b> and into the expansion chamber <b>414</b>. The conduit <b>484</b> preferably has an inlet opening <b>480</b> in the expansion chamber <b>414</b> for receiving foam. The inlet opening <b>480</b> of the conduit <b>484</b> is preferably off-centre relative to the expansion chamber <b>414</b> being at an in-use bottom or lower portion of the expansion chamber <b>414</b>. This may allow for more of the foam in the expansion chamber <b>414</b> to be consumed, since the foam may sink towards the bottom under gravity. Additionally or alternatively, the inlet opening <b>480</b> is proximal to the cartridge-receiving portion <b>478</b> as compared to the outlet <b>482</b>. Again, this may allow for more of the foam in the expansion chamber <b>414</b> to be consumed, for example, if the device is used in a declining orientation with the cartridge-receiving portion <b>478</b> lower than the outlet <b>482</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0264" num="0263">The conduit <b>484</b> preferably also includes a drop, step or turn 556, and as such the conduit <b>484</b> is non-linear, however it will be appreciated that this may not be necessary. The conduit <b>484</b> may include a one-way valve and/or venturi tube, as described for the preceding embodiments.</p>
<p id="p-0265" num="0264">The outlet <b>482</b>, or mouth-piece, is preferably cross-shaped or substantially cross-shaped, although it will be appreciated that other shapes may be considered. The outlet <b>482</b> may additionally or alternatively represent a widening of the conduit <b>484</b> which may encourage emission of foam therefrom.</p>
<p id="p-0266" num="0265">The carrier may also include a holder <b>558</b> which may receive the expansion chamber <b>414</b> and define at least part of the conduit <b>484</b>. The holder may <b>558</b>, for example, be formed from a more rigid material than the expansion chamber <b>414</b>. It will be appreciated that the third embodiment of the device <b>474</b> may include sensors, seals, lighting and/or sound means as previously described for the previous embodiments.</p>
<p id="p-0267" num="0266">In use, the third embodiment of the device <b>474</b> may function in a similar or identical way as the preceding embodiments. The cartridge <b>410</b> is inserted into the cartridge-receiving portion <b>478</b>. This action causes the first protrusion <b>448</b><i>a </i>to first perforate the second perforable wall <b>546</b>, extend through the first chamber <b>412</b>, and then perforate the first perforable wall <b>544</b> to open the barrier between the foam-generation elements <b>426</b>, <b>428</b>. Similarly, the second protrusion <b>448</b><i>b </i>may perforate the second perforable wall <b>546</b>. The user may then squeeze an exposed end of the flexible second chamber <b>468</b> to exert pressure on the liquid to force it through the perforation and the channel <b>550</b> defined by the first protrusion <b>448</b><i>a </i>and into the first chamber <b>412</b>. This is indicated by line A in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>17</b></figref>. In the first chamber <b>412</b>, the foam-generation elements <b>426</b>, <b>428</b> mix and interact to generate a stable foam which expands or flows through the bore <b>552</b> of the second protrusion <b>448</b><i>b </i>and into the expansion chamber <b>414</b>, as indicated by arrow B. The expansion chamber <b>414</b> becomes filled or partially filled with the stable foam. The stable foam may then drawn by the user's inhalations on the outlet <b>482</b> through the conduit <b>484</b>, out of the outlet <b>482</b> and into the users mouth to be inhaled or consumed. The stable foam may be consumed over multiple inhalations and/or over prolonged duration.</p>
<p id="p-0268" num="0267">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>18</b></figref>, there is shown a fourth embodiment of a foam inhalation device <b>874</b>, foam consumption device, foam-dispensation device, or foam drawing device. The fourth embodiment of the foam inhalation device <b>874</b> is similar to the third embodiment of the foam inhalation device <b>474</b>, and it can be assumed that the fourth embodiment has similar or identical components or features as the third embodiment.</p>
<p id="p-0269" num="0268">However, the fourth embodiment of the foam inhalation device <b>874</b> further includes a foam-volume-dispensation control element <b>984</b>, a side air inlet <b>986</b> and a control valve.</p>
<p id="p-0270" num="0269">The foam-volume dispensation control element <b>984</b> is for limiting or slowing a volume of foam dispensed by an outlet <b>882</b> of a carrier <b>872</b> of the device <b>874</b>. To achieve this, the foam-volume-dispensation control element <b>984</b> comprises a partial barrier <b>984</b> which obstructs part of a cross-sectional area of a fluid flow path between a cartridge-receiving portion <b>878</b> which receives a cartridge <b>810</b> and the outlet <b>882</b>. The cartridge <b>810</b> has the or each foam generating component, and therefore in use foam flows from the cartridge <b>810</b>. As such, the foam is impeded by the partial barrier <b>984</b> as it travels from the cartridge-receiving portion <b>878</b> to the user's mouth via the outlet <b>882</b>. For example, the partial barrier <b>984</b> may slow the passage of foam via friction.</p>
<p id="p-0271" num="0270">The foam-volume-dispensation control element <b>984</b> may be at the outlet <b>882</b>. In other words, the foam-volume-dispensation control element <b>984</b> may be in an aperture which defines the outlet <b>882</b>. However, it will be appreciated that the control element <b>984</b> may be away from the outlet <b>882</b>, for example in a conduit of the carrier <b>872</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0272" num="0271">Preferably, the partial barrier <b>984</b> comprises a porous material. For example, a material having holes of a diameter of less than 2 mm, although it will be appreciated that other diameter holes may be considered. Small holes are preferred to impede the passage of the foam most effectively. However, the holes should preferably have a greater diameter than a size of the bubbles of the foam, for example greater than 0.5 mm, to maintain the texture of the foam. Smaller diameter holes could be considered, which may produce a finer textured foam.</p>
<p id="p-0273" num="0272">A suitable material for the partial barrier <b>984</b> may be sintered metal. As such, the partial barrier <b>984</b> may comprise sintered steel or sintered bronze. However, other materials may be considered, such as plastics.</p>
<p id="p-0274" num="0273">The side air inlet <b>986</b> is spaced apart from and to a side of the outlet <b>882</b>. The side air inlet <b>986</b> is fluidly communicated with the fluid flow path or conduit in the carrier <b>872</b> between the cartridge-receiving portion <b>878</b> and the outlet <b>882</b> so that when a user inhales on the outlet <b>882</b>, it draws air into the fluid flow path from the side air inlet <b>986</b>. The side air inlet <b>986</b> is preferably spaced apart from the outlet <b>882</b> by a sufficient distance so as not to be obstructed by a user's mouth when inhaling on the outlet <b>882</b>. For example, the air outlet <b>882</b> may be spaced apart by at least 20 mm.</p>
<p id="p-0275" num="0274">The control valve is between the cartridge-receiving portion <b>878</b> and the outlet <b>882</b> for selectively permitting foam to flow therebetween, the valve being opened and/or closed via a user control <b>990</b>. As such, a user can decide when to permit foam to flow to the outlet <b>882</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0276" num="0275">Preferably, the control valve is biased to a closed condition so that the user control <b>990</b> is required to be continuously operated to hold open the valve. This reduces the risk of the control valve being unintentionally left open and causing leaks of foam.</p>
<p id="p-0277" num="0276">The valve may be biased via a spring and the user control may be a push button <b>990</b>. For example, the valve may comprise a blocking element, stopper or bung which is received in the fluid flow path so as to occlude or close the fluid flow path, for example to occlude the conduit. When the push button <b>990</b> is pressed, this may force the blocking element out of the fluid flow path so that foam can flow to the outlet <b>882</b>. In this way, the user would work against and compress the spring. When the push button <b>990</b> is released, the spring may be released which would cause the blocking element to be moved back into the fluid flow path so as to obstruct the fluid flow path. To permit easier extended use of the device <b>874</b>, the valve may have a releasable locking element, such as a locking pin received through a hole, to lock the valve in an open condition.</p>
<p id="p-0278" num="0277">There may be a one-way valve in addition to the control valve.</p>
<p id="p-0279" num="0278">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>19</b> and <b>20</b></figref>, the cartridge <b>810</b> preferably has at least one finger grip <b>992</b> to permit easier removal from the carrier <b>872</b>. As such, the or each finger grip <b>992</b> are at or adjacent to a rear end of the cartridge <b>810</b>. Here there are finger grips <b>992</b> on two sides of the cartridge <b>810</b>, and preferably there are three finger grips <b>992</b> on each side of the cartridge <b>810</b>. The cartridge <b>810</b> preferably has a perforable seal <b>946</b> at a front end of end of the cartridge <b>810</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0280" num="0279">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>21</b> to <b>26</b></figref>, there is shown a fifth embodiment of a foam inhalation device or a foam drawing device comprises a carrier <b>672</b>, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>21</b> to <b>23</b></figref>, with a cartridge <b>610</b>, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>24</b> to <b>26</b></figref>, received therein. The device is electrically operated and here is powered by a battery <b>760</b> and so is battery-operated, although it will be appreciated that other electrical power sources may be considered.</p>
<p id="p-0281" num="0280">Foam is generated by agitating a liquid with an agitation means, and the agitation means comprises at least an electric motor <b>762</b> and the battery <b>760</b>. The agitation means may otherwise be referred to as an agitator.</p>
<p id="p-0282" num="0281">Referring now in particular to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>21</b> to <b>23</b></figref>, the carrier <b>672</b> has a carrier body <b>676</b> which preferably houses the motor <b>762</b> and the battery <b>760</b>. The carrier <b>672</b> further includes a receiving portion <b>678</b> for receiving the cartridge <b>610</b> at or in the carrier body <b>676</b>. Here the receiving portion <b>678</b> is a recess or open-ended chamber defined by the body <b>676</b> and sized to receive at least part of the cartridge <b>610</b> therein. The receiving portion <b>678</b> preferably only receives part of the cartridge <b>610</b> therein, with an end of the cartridge <b>610</b> protruding from the end of the receiving portion <b>678</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0283" num="0282">The carrier <b>672</b> further includes a carrier foam inlet <b>680</b> for receiving foam from the cartridge <b>610</b> when the cartridge <b>610</b> is received in the receiving portion <b>678</b>. The carrier <b>672</b> also includes a carrier foam outlet <b>682</b>, which is here defined by a mouthpiece <b>764</b>, for dispensing the foam to a user. A carrier foam conduit <b>684</b>, passageway or flow path connects the carrier foam inlet <b>680</b> with the carrier foam outlet <b>682</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0284" num="0283">At least an end portion of the carrier <b>672</b> foam conduit adjacent to the carrier foam inlet <b>680</b> preferably projects or protrudes into the receiving portion <b>678</b> so as to permit the carrier foam conduit <b>684</b> to perforate the cartridge <b>610</b>. However, it will be appreciated that this may not be necessary and the conduit may not project or protrude and may instead abuttingly connect with the cartridge <b>610</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0285" num="0284">The carrier foam conduit <b>684</b> may include a chamber <b>684</b><i>a </i>proximal to the mouthpiece <b>764</b>. However, it will be appreciated that this may be omitted.</p>
<p id="p-0286" num="0285">A one-way valve may be in the carrier foam conduit <b>684</b> for permitting movement of foam from the carrier foam inlet <b>680</b> to the carrier foam outlet <b>682</b> and preventing or limiting movement of fluid from the carrier foam outlet <b>682</b> to the carrier foam inlet <b>680</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0287" num="0286">The carrier further comprises a carrier air inlet <b>690</b> and an air-flow conduit <b>766</b> which extends from the carrier air inlet <b>690</b> and terminates in a carrier air outlet <b>768</b> at, in or adjacent to the receiving portion <b>678</b>. The carrier air inlet <b>690</b> is open to the exterior of the carrier <b>672</b> in use and is separate to and preferably away from the carrier foam outlet <b>682</b>. For example, the carrier foam outlet <b>682</b> is preferably positioned so as not be covered by a user's mouth in use when a user is drawing at the carrier foam outlet <b>682</b>. Preferably the carrier air inlet <b>690</b> is in a base of the carrier <b>672</b>. Similar to the carrier foam conduit <b>684</b>, the air-flow conduit <b>766</b> preferably projects or protrudes into the receiving portion <b>678</b> so as to permit perforation of the cartridge <b>610</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0288" num="0287">The air-flow conduit <b>766</b> and the carrier air outlet <b>768</b> are in use below or beneath the carrier foam conduit <b>684</b> and the carrier foam inlet <b>680</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0289" num="0288">The agitation means preferably comprises an air moving means which is driven by the electric motor <b>762</b> and is for moving air from the carrier air inlet <b>690</b> to the carrier air outlet <b>768</b>. The air moving means may be an air pump <b>770</b>. For example, the air pump <b>770</b> may be a fan or impeller rotatable by the electric motor <b>762</b>, although other forms of air pump <b>770</b> may be considered.</p>
<p id="p-0290" num="0289">The device preferably includes a pressure sensor <b>712</b>, which is here housed in the carrier <b>672</b>. The pressure sensor <b>712</b> is fluidly communicated with the carrier foam outlet <b>682</b> so as to detect when negative pressure is applied to the carrier foam outlet <b>682</b>. Here the pressure sensor <b>712</b> is positioned at, adjacent to or in the chamber <b>684</b><i>a </i>which is proximal to the mouthpiece <b>764</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0291" num="0290">The device includes a processor, which is here provided on or by a printed circuit board <b>772</b>, which is again housed in the carrier <b>672</b>. The battery <b>760</b>, the motor <b>762</b> and the pressure sensor <b>712</b> are connected to the printed circuit board <b>772</b> so that when the pressure sensor <b>712</b> detects negative pressure the processor activates the motor <b>762</b> by providing power from the battery <b>760</b> which drive the air pump <b>770</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0292" num="0291">The electric motor <b>762</b> is preferably a brushless electric motor.</p>
<p id="p-0293" num="0292">The battery <b>760</b> may be rechargeable, and as such there may be a power terminal to permit recharging. Additionally or alternatively, the battery <b>760</b> may be removable from the carrier <b>672</b> to permit replacement. The battery <b>760</b> may be neither replaceable or rechargeable, and so the carrier <b>672</b> may be required to be disposed after discharge of the battery <b>760</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0294" num="0293">Referring now in particular to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>24</b> to <b>26</b></figref>, the cartridge <b>610</b> has a cartridge foam outlet <b>654</b> and defines a container for containing a liquid for producing the foam via agitation.</p>
<p id="p-0295" num="0294">The liquid may comprise at least one foaming agent, surfactant, stabiliser and/or thickener to permit generation of foam via agitation. This may include lectin and/or xanthan gum. The foaming agent, and liquid as a whole, should be food-safe to permit consumption by a person.</p>
<p id="p-0296" num="0295">The liquid may include an acid and/or a carbonate, such as citric acid and/or sodium bicarbonate. In the case that an acid and carbonate were included in the cartridge, they may have already produced a foam and/or carbon dioxide and there may be the resulting salt, such as sodium citrate, in the cartridge <b>610</b> before use of the device. If the carbon dioxide from such a reaction is still being produced whilst the cartridge <b>610</b> is sealed, then this may spontaneously produce some foam upon opening of the cartridge <b>610</b> due to a reduction in pressure resulting in release of dissolved carbon dioxide. However, even in this case, the primary foam generation method is via agitation.</p>
<p id="p-0297" num="0296">The cartridge <b>610</b> is preferably elongate and tubular or substantially tubular. Here the cartridge <b>610</b> has a flat end, which includes the cartridge foam outlet <b>654</b>, and a rounded end opposing the flat end.</p>
<p id="p-0298" num="0297">The cartridge <b>610</b> may comprise a flexible material to allow manual manipulation thereof, although it will be appreciated that this may not be the case and the cartridge <b>610</b> may comprise of a rigid material.</p>
<p id="p-0299" num="0298">The cartridge <b>610</b> preferably also comprises a cartridge air inlet <b>774</b>. The cartridge air inlet <b>774</b> is preferably at or adjacent to the cartridge foam outlet <b>654</b>, for example being in the flat end, although it will be appreciated that it may be positioned elsewhere. The cartridge air inlet <b>774</b> is preferably in use below the cartridge foam outlet <b>654</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0300" num="0299">The cartridge <b>610</b> preferably has an air-injection conduit <b>776</b> which extends from the cartridge air inlet <b>774</b> into an interior <b>778</b> of the cartridge <b>610</b> for injecting air into the cartridge <b>610</b> via at least one opening <b>780</b> in the air-injection conduit <b>776</b>. Preferably, the air-injection conduit <b>776</b> is elongate and has a plurality of openings <b>780</b> therein which are spaced apart from each other in a longitudinal extent of the air-injection conduit <b>776</b>. Preferably, there is no opening in an end of the air-injection conduit <b>776</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0301" num="0300">There may be at least one opening <b>780</b> on two opposing sides of the air-injection conduit <b>776</b>. Preferably, the openings <b>780</b> on each side are aligned with each other.</p>
<p id="p-0302" num="0301">Each opening <b>780</b> may be circular in shape. Preferably, there are at least five openings <b>780</b>, here there being seven openings <b>780</b> on each opposing side of the air-injection conduit <b>776</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0303" num="0302">Alternatively, each opening <b>780</b> may have the shape of a segment of a circle and/or may be semi-circular. In this case, each side of the air-injection conduit <b>776</b> may have multiple pairs of openings <b>780</b>, each opening <b>780</b> of a pair is spaced apart from each other in a lateral direction of the conduit. Preferably, there are seven pairs of openings <b>780</b> at each side of the conduit.</p>
<p id="p-0304" num="0303">The cartridge air inlet <b>774</b> and the cartridge foam outlet <b>654</b> are each closed by a perforable or otherwise openable seal. For example, here each of the cartridge air inlet <b>774</b> and the cartridge foam outlet <b>654</b> has a perforable seal which is preferably also flexible, such as a silicone seal.</p>
<p id="p-0305" num="0304">The carrier foam conduit <b>684</b> and the air-flow conduit <b>766</b> of the carrier <b>672</b> are arranged to perforate the cartridge foam outlet <b>654</b> and the cartridge air inlet <b>774</b> respectively, when the cartridge <b>610</b> is received in the receiving portion <b>678</b> of the carrier <b>672</b>. This is achieved by the projection of the conduits into the receiving portion <b>678</b>, as previously described. Additionally, a width or diameter of each conduit is sized so as to be received within the respective outlet and inlet. A border portion of the flexible seals may form a seal with the respective conduits so that leaks of liquid or foam is reduced. Additionally or alternatively, the conduits may be sized so as to sealingly engage with a perimeter of the outlet or inlet.</p>
<p id="p-0306" num="0305">The cartridge <b>610</b> and the carrier <b>672</b> are configured so that the cartridge air inlet <b>774</b> is connected with the carrier air outlet <b>768</b>, and the cartridge foam outlet <b>654</b> is connected with the carrier foam inlet <b>680</b>, when the cartridge <b>610</b> is received in the receiving portion <b>678</b>. Although not shown, to reduce the risk of misconnection between the carrier air outlet <b>768</b> and the cartridge foam outlet <b>654</b> and the cartridge air inlet <b>774</b> and the carrier foam inlet <b>680</b>, the cartridge <b>610</b> and/or receiving portion <b>678</b> may be shaped to only permit receipt of the cartridge <b>610</b> in a correct orientation. For example, the cartridge <b>610</b> may have a protrusion and the carrier <b>672</b> may have a recess or groove so that the cartridge <b>610</b> and carrier <b>672</b> can only be correctly relatively positioned. Alternatively, the inlets and outlets may be non-symmetrically positioned so as to permit connection in only one orientation.</p>
<p id="p-0307" num="0306">The device may be arranged to only operate the agitation means when a cartridge <b>610</b> is received in the carrier <b>672</b>. To achieve this, the carrier <b>672</b> is preferably configured to detect when a cartridge <b>610</b> is received in the receiving portion <b>678</b>. The carrier <b>672</b> may have a switch which is operated by the cartridge <b>610</b> being received in the receiving portion <b>678</b>. For example, the carrier <b>672</b> may have exposed electrical contacts or terminals, with the cartridge <b>610</b> having an electrically conducting portion which is positioned on the cartridge <b>610</b> so that, when the cartridge <b>610</b> is received in the receiving portion <b>678</b>, the electrical contacts are connected by the electrically conducting portion. Alternatively, the carrier <b>672</b> may have a manual or pressure sensitive switch or button which is depressed when the cartridge <b>610</b> is received in the receiving portion <b>678</b>. Either switch may be connected with the processor on the printed circuit board <b>772</b>, so that when the cartridge <b>610</b> is received in the carrier <b>672</b> the processor is aware that the cartridge <b>610</b> is present. The processor may therefore only operate the agitation means when the cartridge <b>610</b> is detected and when suction is detected on the mouthpiece <b>764</b> by the pressure or airflow-sensor. This is to prevent unintentional operation of the motor and thus prevent draining of the battery <b>760</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0308" num="0307">In use, when a user wishes to consume foam, the cartridge <b>610</b>, pre-loaded with the liquid, is inserted into the receiving portion <b>678</b>. The carrier foam conduit <b>684</b> and the air-flow conduit <b>766</b> perforates or penetrates the cartridge foam outlet <b>654</b> and the cartridge air inlet <b>774</b> respectively. The cartridge <b>610</b> operates the switch so that the processor detects the presence of the cartridge <b>610</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0309" num="0308">The user then draws, inhales or sucks on the mouthpiece <b>764</b> of the carrier <b>672</b>. This creates low pressure in the carrier foam conduit <b>684</b> which is detected by the pressure sensor <b>712</b>. Since the processor is aware of the presence of the cartridge <b>610</b>, the processor activates the motor which draws power from the battery <b>760</b> to operate the air pump <b>770</b>. The air pump <b>770</b> draws air from the carrier air inlet <b>690</b>, along the air-flow conduit <b>766</b> and into the cartridge <b>610</b> via the carrier air outlet <b>768</b>. Air is injected into the liquid via the openings <b>780</b> in the air-injection conduit <b>776</b>. As such, the liquid is effectively bubbled with air. The liquid is transformed into foam via this agitation.</p>
<p id="p-0310" num="0309">The suction applied by the user causes the foam to be drawn out of the cartridge <b>610</b> via the cartridge foam outlet <b>654</b> and along the carrier foam conduit <b>684</b>. The user thereby draws foam into their mouth via the carrier foam outlet <b>682</b>. The user may stop inhaling once sufficient foam has been drawn, which may deactivate the agitation means.</p>
<p id="p-0311" num="0310">Draws on the mouthpiece <b>764</b> to generate foam via agitation may be repeated to permit the user to consume more foam until the liquid in the cartridge <b>610</b> has been consumed.</p>
<p id="p-0312" num="0311">It is therefore possible to provide a device which produces a stable foam, as opposed to only a short-lived effervescence and/or a rapidly propelled inhalant, which allows for a user to consume or inhale a substance contained within the foam over a prolonged duration and with multiple inhalations. This provides a smoking alternative device or cigarette substitute without requiring burning or heating. The device and/or a cartridge of the device may be devoid of electrical energisation means and so this would reduce or eliminate a requirement for electrical charging.</p>
