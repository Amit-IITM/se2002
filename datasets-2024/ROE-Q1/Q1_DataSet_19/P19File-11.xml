<heading level="1" id="h-0005">DETAILED DESCRIPTION</heading>
<p id="p-0017" num="0016">The present disclosure more fully describes various embodiments with reference to the accompanying drawings. It should be understood that some, but not all embodiments are shown and described herein. Indeed, the embodiments may take many different forms, and accordingly this disclosure should not be construed as limited to the embodiments set forth herein. Rather, these embodiments are provided so that this disclosure will satisfy applicable legal requirements. Like numbers refer to like elements throughout.</p>
<p id="p-0018" num="0017">It should be understood at the outset that although illustrative implementations of one or more aspects are illustrated below, the disclosed assemblies, systems, and methods may be implemented using any number of techniques, whether currently known or not yet in existence. The disclosure should in no way be limited to the illustrative implementations, drawings, and techniques illustrated below, but may be modified within the scope of the appended claims along with their full scope of equivalents. While values for dimensions of various elements are disclosed, the drawings may not be to scale.</p>
<p id="p-0019" num="0018">The words &#x201c;example,&#x201d; or &#x201c;exemplary,&#x201d; when used herein, are intended to mean &#x201c;serving as an example, instance, or illustration.&#x201d; Any implementation described herein as an &#x201c;example&#x201d; or &#x201c;exemplary embodiment&#x201d; is not necessarily preferred or advantageous over other implementations.</p>
<p id="p-0020" num="0019">Workers in various industries (e.g., soldiers, firefighters, relief workers, and/or the like) are may be tasked with working under time constraints that require the workers to get dressed and/or put on a pair of footwear articles in a minimal amount of time. Such temporal constraints thereby result in a need for the worker to avoid unnecessarily wasting the time by putting one or more of a pair of footwear articles on the wrong foot. Various embodiments described herein are directed to haptic systems for promoting identification of an alignment of a pair of footwear articles relative to at least one foot of a wearer. As described herein, the present invention may be configured such that, prior to the user putting on a pair of footwear articles, upon the pair of footwear articles being positioned at least substantially proximate one another in an alignment, the haptic system provided within may cause a visual indication and/or a tactile sensation in the user&#x2019;s hands that may function as an indicator that the pair of footwear articles (e.g., the left-foot and right-foot footwear articles), are arranged in a proper left/right alignment relative to one another. As described herein, an exemplary haptic system may be defined by at least one footwear article (e.g., of a pair of footwear articles) having a collar comprising an inner collar portion and an outer collar portion that are configured differently from one another so as to facilitate the correct identification of the footwear article by the user as a left-foot or right-foot footwear article and minimize the risk that the user will put the footwear article on the incorrect foot, such as, for example, by putting a left-foot footwear article on the user&#x2019;s right foot and/or putting a right-foot footwear article on the user&#x2019;s left foot.</p>
<p id="p-0021" num="0020">The present invention promotes the immediate recognition, by a user, of a misaligned pair of footwear articles-wherein a left-foot footwear article is arranged in a position to the right of the right-foot footwear article and the right-foot footwear article is arranged in a position to the left of the left-foot footwear article (e.g., from the perspective of a user position defined by a rear-view) such that the outer sides of the left-foot and right-foot footwear articles are facing towards one another-prior to the user putting on the footwear articles. For example, as described in further detail herein, an inside collar portion of a footwear article and an outer collar portion of the footwear article may comprise at least substantially different configurations, such that, prior to the user putting on the footwear article, the user may be able distinguish, via visual identification and/or via tactile sensation, between the inner and outer sides of the footwear article. As such, the user may be able to identify, for example, that the outer sides of the respective footwear articles are facing one another and, thus, that the left-foot footwear article and right-foot footwear article are arranged in a misaligned (e.g., switched) configuration. As an illustrative example, the present invention may be defined at least in part by a footwear article comprising a collar with an inner collar portion profile that at least partially corresponds to a palm curvature of a user&#x2019;s hand, such that, upon the user picking up one or more of the footwear articles by the inner collar portion(s) thereof, the inner collar portion(s) of the footwear articles(s) may fit in and/or align with the palm of the user&#x2019;s hand such that the user experiences a tactile sensation that the user may associate with a correct fit and/or proper alignment of the pair of footwear articles relative to one or more of the user&#x2019;s feet. Further, as an additional illustrative example described in further detail herein, the present invention may be defined at least in part by a footwear article comprising a collar with an inner collar portion having a height that is at least substantially different than an outer collar portion height of the outer collar portion thereof, so as to enable the visual distinction, by a user, between the inner side and the outer side of a footwear article, and thus, whether the footwear article is properly aligned relative to the other footwear article of the pair to be worn by the user.</p>
<p id="p-0022" num="0021"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref> illustrates a rear view of a pair of footwear articles and an exemplary haptic system according to various embodiments described herein. In particular, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>, illustrates a haptic system for promoting identification of an alignment of a pair of footwear articles relative to at least one foot of a wearer. For example, as described herein, an exemplary haptic system may be defined by at least one of a pair of footwear articles having a collar with an inner collar portion configuration and an outer collar portion configuration, wherein the inner collar portion configuration that is at least substantially different than the outer collar portion configuration. As a non-limiting example described in further detail herein, the inner collar portion configuration of the collar of the footwear article defining the haptic system may be defined by an inner collar portion profile that corresponds at least in part to a curvature of the palm of a human hand, so as to generate a haptic response with a user that facilitates a recognition of a proper left-right designation (e.g., alignment) of the footwear article upon a user engaging (e.g., grabbing) the inner collar portion of the footwear article.</p>
<p id="p-0023" num="0022">In various embodiments, an exemplary pair of footwear articles may comprise a first footwear article and a second footwear article structured to be worn on a first foot and a second foot of a wearer, respectively. As illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>, an exemplary haptic system <b>10</b> may be provided at a pair of footwear articles that may comprise a first footwear article <b>100</b> comprising a left-foot footwear article structured to be worn on a left foot of a wearer and a second footwear article <b>200</b> comprising a right-foot footwear article structured to be worn on a right foot of the wearer. As non-limiting examples, in various embodiments, an exemplary footwear article may comprise a shoe, a work boot, combat boot, and/or any other footwear article comprising an at least partially structured collar. For example, using the first footwear article <b>100</b> as an exemplary footwear article embodiment for illustrative purposes, an exemplary first footwear article <b>100</b> may comprise a footwear article body that defines a footwear article interior portion therein that is configured for receiving the first foot (e.g., left foot) of the user via a first foot opening. The footwear article body of the first footwear article <b>100</b> may extend from a front footwear article end (not shown) defined along the front of the footwear article (e.g., at least substantially proximate the toe and/or tongue portion(s) thereof) to a rear footwear article end <b>102</b> defined along the back of the footwear article (e.g., at least substantially proximate a heel portion thereof). In various embodiments, the footwear article body of the first footwear article <b>100</b> may include an inner body portion <b>110</b> defined along an inner side of the first footwear article <b>100</b> (e.g., facing in an inward direction towards the second footwear article <b>200</b>, as illustrated, such as, in the positive z-direction as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>) and an outer body portion <b>120</b> defined along an outer side of the first footwear article <b>100</b> (e.g., facing in an outward direction away from the second footwear article <b>200</b>, as illustrated, such as, in the negative z-direction as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>). In various embodiments, the first footwear article may comprise a collar <b>130</b> comprising an at least partially structured element provided along a top portion of the first footwear article <b>100</b> (e.g., the footwear article body) and positioned to extend around at least a portion of the foot opening so as to define at least a portion of an outer perimeter of the foot opening. For example, the collar <b>130</b> may comprise an inner collar portion <b>131</b> extending along a top portion of the inner body portion <b>110</b> and an outer collar portion <b>132</b> extending along a top portion of the outer body portion <b>120</b>. In various embodiments, the inner collar portion <b>131</b> and the outer collar portion <b>132</b> may be defined by an at least substantially continuous element (e.g., material), or, alternatively, may comprise two distinct elements positioned along the inner body portion <b>110</b> and the outer body portion <b>120</b>, respectively, that are separated by a gap along the rear footwear article end <b>102</b> of the first footwear article <b>100</b>. Although described herein with respect to the first footwear article <b>100</b>, it should be understood that an exemplary haptic system may be at least partially defined within a second footwear article <b>200</b> (e.g., a right-foot footwear article). As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref> and described above with respect to the first footwear article <b>100</b>, the second footwear article <b>200</b> may comprise a footwear article body that defines a respective footwear article interior portion and foot opening, a front footwear article end (not shown), a rear footwear article end <b>202</b>, an inner body portion <b>210</b>, and an outer body portion <b>220</b>, and may further comprise a collar <b>230</b> that comprises an inner collar portion <b>231</b> extending along a top portion of the inner body portion <b>210</b> and an outer collar portion <b>232</b> extending along a top portion of the outer body portion <b>220</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0024" num="0023">In various embodiments, an exemplary haptic system <b>10</b> may comprise a footwear article, such as, for exemplary illustrative purposes, first footwear article <b>100</b>, comprising a collar <b>130</b> that includes an inner collar portion <b>131</b> defined by an inner collar portion configuration and an outer collar portion <b>132</b> defined by an outer collar portion configuration. Further, in various embodiments, the configuration of an exemplary collar portion (e.g., an inner collar portion <b>131</b>, an outer collar portion <b>132</b>) may be defined at least in part by a collar portion height, a collar portion length, and a collar portion profile. In various embodiments, as described in further detail herein in reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref>, a collar length of an exemplary collar portion may be defined by the linear distance between a first collar portion end provided at a front side of the collar portion and a second collar portion end provided at a front side of the collar portion, as measured along a length axis extending linearly therebetween.

<p id="p-0033" num="0032">In various embodiments, as illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b>A</figref>, an exemplary haptic system may be defined at least in part by an inner collar portion of a footwear article having an inner collar portion profile that corresponds to at least one curvature of a palm portion of an exemplary hand. For example, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>4</b>A and <b>4</b>B</figref> illustrate various perspective views of a footwear article and various aspects of an exemplary haptic system according to various embodiments described herein. In particular, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b>A</figref> illustrates an isolated left-side perspective view of an exemplary left-foot footwear article <b>100</b> showing an inner side of the left-foot footwear article <b>100</b>.

For example, in such an exemplary configuration, the haptic system may be configured such that upon a user engaging the outer collar portion <b>132</b> of a left-foot footwear article <b>100</b> with a palm portion of the user&#x2019;s corresponding hand (e.g., the user&#x2019;s righthand <b>2</b>, as illustrated) <b>1</b>, such as, for example, in order to pick up and/or put on the left-foot footwear article <b>100</b>, at least a portion of the outer collar portion profile of the outer collar portion <b>132</b> may remain a distance away from the palm curvature <b>12</b> of the user&#x2019;s hand <b>2</b> such that the outer collar portion <b>132</b> fails to fit into and/or align with the palm portion of the user&#x2019;s hand <b>2</b>. Accordingly, the unamicable fit between the outer collar portion <b>132</b> and the palm curvature <b>12</b> of the user&#x2019;s hand <b>2</b> may provide a tactile sensation to the user that may be indicative of an improper left/right alignment of the left-foot footwear article <b>100</b> (e.g., an alignment of the left-foot footwear article <b>100</b> on a right and/or outer side of a right-foot footwear article such that the left-foot footwear article appears to correspond to the right-foot of a user, and thus, promote the engagement of the left-foot footwear article <b>100</b> by the right hand <b>2</b> of the user).</p>
<p id="p-0035" num="0034">For example, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>5</b>A-<b>5</b>C</figref> illustrate various perspective views of a footwear article and various aspects of an exemplary haptic system according to various embodiments described herein.

For example, as illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b>A</figref>, the outer collar portion profile may have an at least substantially flat profile, such as, for example, a profile having an at least substantially zero-curvature in the vertical direction. As shown, the outer collar portion profile of the outer collar portion <b>132</b> may comprise an at least substantially linear portion that extends between the first outer collar portion end <b>132</b><i>a</i> and the second outer collar portion end <b>132</b><i>b</i> in a direction that is at least substantially parallel to the length axis <b>132</b><i>c</i> defined therebetween. Alternatively, or additionally, in various embodiments, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b>B</figref>, the outer collar portion <b>132</b> may be defined by an outer collar portion profile comprising a vertical curvature defined at least partially in a downward vertical direction such that an outer collar portion depth defined by a minimum height of the outer collar portion is arranged along an outer collar portion length between a first outer collar portion end <b>132</b><i>a</i> and a second outer collar portion end <b>132</b><i>b</i>. In such an exemplary configuration, the outer collar portion depth may be disposed at least substantially below an outer length axis of the outer collar portion, as measured in the vertical direction. For example, in various embodiments wherein the outer collar portion <b>132</b> is defined by an outer collar portion profile comprising a vertical curvature defined at least partially in a downward vertical direction, as illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b>B</figref>, the outer collar portion profile of the outer collar portion <b>132</b> may comprise an inverse configuration relative to inner collar portion profile of the inner collar portion <b>131</b> of the exemplary collar <b>130</b>. Further, alternatively, or additionally, in various embodiments, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b>C</figref>, the outer collar portion <b>132</b> may be defined by an outer collar portion profile comprising an at least substantially complex profile defined by one or more discrete geometric shapes, a plurality discrete curvatures, and/or the like, or a combination thereof. For example, as illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b>C</figref>, the outer collar portion profile may have an at least substantially wavy profile, such as, for example, a profile having an at least substantially sinusoidal configuration defined by a plurality of serially arranged curvatures.</p>
<p id="p-0036" num="0035">As described herein, a pair of footwear articles defining a haptic footwear system may comprise a left-foot footwear article comprising a first collar with a first inner collar portion defined by an inner collar portion profile corresponding to a left-hand palm curvature of an exemplary user&#x2019;s left-hand, and a right-foot footwear article <b>200</b>  comprising a second collar with an inner collar portion defined by a second inner collar portion profile corresponding to a right-hand palm curvature of an exemplary user&#x2019;s right-hand.
