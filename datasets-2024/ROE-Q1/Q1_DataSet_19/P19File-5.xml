<p id="p-0002" num="0001">Embodiments of the present invention relate to food cooking appliances.</p>
<heading level="1" id="h-0002">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">Outdoor cooking has become very popular, and accordingly the need for portable appliances to facilitate outdoor cooking has increased. As part of this trend, a desire has developed to practice all forms of cooking outdoors, including baking. A number of different appliances are currently available to bake food, particularly pizza, outdoors. In order to bake or cook pizza, the baking chamber is preferably very hot and traditionally the best pizza ovens have been constructed of brick which enables the baking chamber to be maintained at very high temperatures. Cooking temperatures above 400F degrees are normally required, and preferable cooking temperatures may range as high as 700F-900F degrees or even higher. Furthermore, it is preferable to cook pizza on a stone or stone-like surface because the stone efficiently conducts and holds heat, which may keep the oven temperature steady even when a cold ingredient (such as an uncooked pizza) is introduced. A stone cooking surface not only helps the pizza cook more evenly, but also allows the bottom to get crisp. A crisp outer crust is considered essential for a quality pizza.</p>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">Cooking appliances require some form of power and/or fuel to generate the heat required for cooking. With respect to outdoor ovens in particular, it may be difficult to provide sufficient power to generate the high temperatures desired to cook pizza. Power may also be needed to rotate a pizza stone relative to a heat source when using a compact portable outdoor oven to cook pizza. However, in order to be truly portable, an oven should not rely solely on alternating current (AC) as a power source. Conversely, the power requirement of traditional gas heating elements capable of generating the desired temperatures for cooking pizza may require relatively large supplies of gas fuel, e.g., twenty-pound propane cylinders. Further, non-electric heating elements, such as conventional propane burners, may be prone to uneven heating and poor reheating characteristics when tasked with heating a series of cold items, one after the other. As a result of these challenges, manufacturers have struggled to provide an affordable and truly portable oven for cooking pizza that is able to generate and maintain the desired cooking temperatures. Manufacturers have also found it difficult to provide an affordable and compact portable oven for cooking pizza that distributes heat in a manner that produces a crisp outer crust without burning portions of the pizza.</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">In light of the foregoing challenges, there is a need for an affordable portable pizza oven that is untethered to a continuous supply of AC electrical power. Portable ovens including an onboard replaceable or rechargeable battery pack are needed to provide nearly unlimited portability.</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">There is a need also for a portable pizza oven that is relatively light, compact, and capable of being used safely on a table top surface. In particular, there is a need for a compact oven that is still capable of cooking a pizza approximately sixteen (16) inches in diameter to provide sufficient amounts of food for several people at a time.</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">There is a need also for a portable pizza oven that is able to generate and sustain the high temperatures required for cooking pizza. A preferred oven should be able to maintain required cooking temperatures while cooking a series of pizzas. As such, a preferred portable pizza oven should be capable of more quickly rebounding to a desired cooking temperature when tasked with heating a series of cold items, one after the other. As a result of maintenance of high temperatures, cooking times preferably may be under ten (10) minutes, more preferably under seven (7) minutes, and even more preferably about five (5) minutes.</p>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">There is a need also for a portable pizza oven that improves the ease with which a pizza may be quickly and evenly cooked to have a crisp outer crust without burning. In particular, there is a need for an oven that applies heat in a manner that crisps all portions of the crust evenly, including the very center of the pizza and the outer edge.</p>
<p id="p-0009" num="0008">There is a need also for a portable pizza oven that is esthetically pleasing and mimics the look and feel of a traditional brick oven. In particular, because pizza ovens must be maintained at such a high temperature, there is a need for an oven that can quickly acquire cooking temperature and maintain it without requiring the user to open and close a baking chamber door which would necessarily be very hot to the touch.</p>
<p id="p-0010" num="0009">There is a need also for a portable pizza oven that is designed to be used safely outdoors without generating excessively high outer surface temperatures.</p>
<p id="p-0011" num="0010">There is a need also for a portable pizza oven that efficiently manages the collection of grease or other food particles that fall from the pizza during cooking or during the process of placing the pizza in, and removing the pizza from, the oven. Still further, there is a need for a portable pizza oven that is easily cleaned after use.</p>
