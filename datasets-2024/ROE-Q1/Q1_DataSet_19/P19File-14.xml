<abstract id="abstract">
<p id="p-0001" num="0000">A foldable playard includes a frame defining an interior space when unfolded and soft goods partially disposed within the interior space to define a partially enclosed space for a child to play and/or sleep. The frame includes multiple leg support assemblies and multiple X-frame assemblies that couple adjacent leg support assemblies together. The X-frame assembly is positioned near the top of the frame when the playard is unfolded such that the X-frame assembly functions as a top rail to mechanically reinforce the playard. In this manner, the playard does not include a separate compliant or rigid top rail or a bottom support structure, thus reducing the number of parts for manufacture. Additionally, the playard includes a single latch mechanism to maintain the playard in the unfolded configuration. The playard may also include an optional canopy cover assembly mounted to the frame to provide shade for the child.</p>

<heading id="h-0002" level="1">BACKGROUND</heading>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">A playard (also referred to herein as a &#x201c;playpen&#x201d; or a &#x201c;game bed&#x201d;) is a framed enclosure that provides a safe and comfortable space for a young child (e.g., an infant, a toddler) to sleep and play without significant supervision from a caregiver. The playard typically includes a support structure (e.g., a frame) that outlines an interior space of the playard; the playard also includes soft padding (also referred to herein as &#x201c;soft goods&#x201d;) placed within the interior space to provide a partially enclosed cushioned space to contain the child. Playards are generally foldable and/or collapsible to improve portability. For example, the caregiver may fold the playard for storage and/or transport and unfold the playard for use. Various types of playards have been manufactured and commercialized over the years with designs that have evolved, in part, depending on whether the playard is used primarily in outdoor settings or indoor settings.</p>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b>A</figref> shows one example of a conventional outdoor playard <b>10</b><i>a </i>in an unfolded configuration. As shown, the playard <b>10</b><i>a </i>includes a frame <b>46</b> with multiple X-frame assemblies <b>20</b><i>a </i>that outline an interior space <b>11</b>. Each X-frame assembly <b>20</b><i>a </i>includes X-tubes <b>22</b><i>a </i>and <b>22</b><i>b </i>that form a crossing pattern. In this example, the X-frame assemblies <b>20</b><i>a </i>are pivot-only X-frame assemblies where the X-tubes <b>22</b><i>a </i>and <b>22</b><i>b </i>are only rotatably coupled to each other and to other X-tubes to such that the frame <b>46</b> is foldable. As shown in the exploded-view inset in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b>A</figref>, the playard <b>10</b><i>a </i>is provided with a latch mechanism <b>16</b> that attaches to the X-tubes <b>22</b><i>a </i>and <b>22</b><i>b </i>to lock the X-frame assemblies <b>20</b><i>a </i>in place when unfolded. Soft goods <b>12</b> are attached to the X-frame assemblies <b>20</b><i>a </i>and disposed along the sides and the floor of the interior space <b>11</b> for providing a partially enclosed space <b>13</b> for the child that is shaped and/or dimensioned to be similar to or smaller than the interior space <b>11</b> of the frame <b>46</b>. As shown, the soft goods <b>12</b> includes webbing <b>14</b> along a top edge of the partially enclosed space <b>13</b> that functions as a top rail to increase the mechanical rigidity and stability of the playard <b>10</b><i>a </i>when the playard <b>10</b><i>a </i>is deployed. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b>A</figref> also shows the playard <b>10</b><i>a </i>includes a canopy cover <b>40</b> disposed above the partially enclosed space <b>13</b> and mounted to the X-frame assemblies <b>20</b><i>a </i>to provide shade for a child.</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b>B</figref> shows another example of a conventional outdoor playard <b>10</b><i>b</i>. As shown, the playard <b>10</b><i>b </i>includes a frame <b>46</b> with multiple pivot and slidable X-frame assemblies <b>20</b><i>b </i>coupled to adjoining leg support assemblies <b>24</b>. Each leg support assembly <b>24</b> includes a leg tube <b>25</b>, a corner (hidden beneath the soft goods <b>12</b>) at the top of the leg tube <b>25</b>, and a slider <b>26</b><i>a </i>or <b>26</b><i>b </i>that slides along the leg tube <b>25</b>. The X-tubes <b>22</b><i>a </i>and <b>22</b><i>b </i>of each X-frame assembly <b>20</b> are coupled to respective sliders <b>26</b><i>a </i>and/or <b>26</b><i>b </i>and corners of the leg support assemblies <b>24</b>. Thus, when the playard <b>10</b><i>b </i>is being folded or unfolded, the X-tubes <b>22</b><i>a </i>and <b>22</b><i>b </i>undergo both rotation and displacement along the leg tubes <b>25</b> via the sliders <b>26</b><i>a </i>and/or <b>26</b><i>b</i>. Compared to the pivot-only X-frame assemblies <b>20</b><i>a </i>of the playard <b>10</b><i>a</i>, the pivot and slidable X-frame assemblies <b>20</b><i>b </i>of the playard <b>10</b><i>b </i>enable the playard <b>10</b><i>b </i>to be folded more compactly thus occupying less space in a folded configuration; additionally, the pivot and slidable X-frame assemblies <b>20</b><i>b </i>allow the frame <b>46</b> to provide a larger interior space <b>11</b> and, hence, a larger partially enclosed space <b>13</b> for a child when the playard <b>10</b><i>b </i>is in an unfolded configuration.</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">As before, the soft goods <b>12</b> may be attached to the leg support assemblies <b>24</b> and/or the X-frame assemblies <b>20</b><i>b</i>. The playard <b>10</b><i>b </i>also includes a pair of latch mechanisms <b>16</b><i>a </i>and <b>16</b><i>b </i>respectively mounted to sliders <b>26</b><i>b </i>on leg support assemblies <b>24</b> disposed on opposing sides of the playard <b>10</b><i>b</i>. As shown in the inset of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b>B</figref>, the sliders <b>26</b><i>b </i>are different from the sliders <b>26</b><i>a </i>due to including features to lock the latch mechanisms <b>16</b><i>a </i>and <b>16</b><i>b</i>. The playard <b>10</b><i>b </i>also includes a canopy cover <b>40</b> disposed above the partially enclosed space <b>13</b> and mounted to the corners of the leg support assemblies <b>24</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b>C</figref> shows an example of a conventional indoor playard <b>10</b><i>c</i>. As shown, the playard <b>10</b><i>c </i>includes a frame <b>46</b> formed from multiple legs <b>30</b> and rigid top rails <b>32</b> to provide a rigid frame supporting soft goods <b>12</b>. The frame <b>46</b> also includes a bottom support structure <b>34</b> so that the floor of the partially enclosed space <b>13</b> defined by the soft goods <b>12</b> is suspended off the ground. Compared to the outdoor playards <b>10</b><i>a </i>and <b>10</b><i>b</i>, the indoor playard <b>10</b><i>c </i>does not include X-frame assemblies to facilitate folding and/or unfolding. Instead, the top rails <b>32</b> are coupled to a hinge <b>36</b>, which allows the playard <b>10</b><i>c </i>to be collapsed into a smaller form as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b>D</figref>. Additionally, the bottom support structure <b>34</b> is also foldable. Thus, to fold the playard <b>10</b><i>c</i>, the caregiver needs to first remove some of the soft goods <b>12</b>, pull up a bottom hub to fold the bottom support structure <b>34</b> (step &#x2018;A&#x2019; in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b>D</figref>), and then unlock and fold the top rails <b>32</b> (step B&#x2032; in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b>D</figref>). The caregiver needs to perform these steps in reverse to setup the playard <b>10</b><i>c. </i></p>
<heading id="h-0003" level="1">SUMMARY</heading>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">The Inventors have recognized and appreciated that a foldable playard provides a caregiver a convenient and safe space for their child to play and/or sleep once the playard is setup, which alleviates the caregiver from having to continuously monitor their child. However, the Inventors have also recognized that conventional playards in some instances may be cumbersome to setup and/or stow away due, in part, to complicated mechanisms for folding, unfolding, latching and/or unlatching the playard (and correspondingly protracted procedures that the caregiver needs to perform while generally caring for their child). The complexity of conventional playards also results in a bulkier product, which is more difficult to handle and more expensive to manufacture and purchase as a consumer.</p>
<p id="p-0009" num="0008">First, the Inventors have observed that conventional playards typically include various support structures, in addition to their frames, to provide more rigid boundaries outlining the interior space, so as to better contain the child and/or to increase the mechanical rigidity and stability of the frame. In many instances, one or more additional support structures are added to the frame of a conventional playard to ensure the playard meets various consumer safety standards related to the mechanical properties of the frame (e.g., American Society for Testing and Materials (ASTM) F406-19 entitled, &#x201c;Standard Consumer Safety Specification for Non-Full-Size Baby Cribs/Play Yards&#x201d;).</p>
<p id="p-0010" num="0009">With reference again to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b>A</figref> and <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b>B</figref>, as noted above the respective frames <b>46</b> of the playards <b>10</b><i>a </i>and <b>10</b><i>b </i>include X-frame assemblies <b>20</b><i>a </i>and <b>20</b><i>b </i>to facilitate folding and/or unfolding of the frames <b>46</b>. When unfolded, the X-frame assemblies <b>20</b><i>a </i>and <b>20</b><i>b </i>are disposed along the respective sides of the frames <b>46</b>, thus providing a mechanically rigid and stable structure.</p>
<p id="p-0011" num="0010">However, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b>A</figref> shows the X-tubes <b>22</b><i>a </i>and <b>22</b><i>b </i>of the X-frame assembly <b>20</b><i>a </i>in the playard <b>10</b><i>a</i>, when unfolded, span the sides of the frame <b>46</b>; this results in a top portion <b>47</b> of the interior space <b>11</b> above the X-frame assembly <b>20</b><i>a </i>that is not mechanically supported by the frame <b>46</b>. If flexible, compliant soft goods <b>12</b> are placed over the frame <b>46</b> as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b>A</figref>, a child could potentially climb out of the playard <b>10</b><i>a </i>through the top portion <b>47</b> by folding and/or collapsing the soft goods. In view of the foregoing, as an additional support structure, the soft goods <b>12</b> includes an integrated webbing <b>14</b> that is pulled taut when the frame <b>46</b> is unfolded such that the webbing <b>14</b> mechanically functions as a top rail. In this manner, the webbing <b>14</b> provides a more rigid boundary spanning the top portions <b>47</b> of the interior space <b>11</b> to support the soft goods and to better keep the child within the playard <b>10</b><i>a. </i></p>
<p id="p-0012" num="0011"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b>B</figref> similarly shows that the X-tubes <b>22</b><i>a </i>and <b>22</b><i>b </i>of the X-frame assembly <b>20</b><i>b </i>in the playard <b>10</b><i>b</i>, when unfolded, do not mechanically support the top portions <b>47</b> of the interior space <b>11</b> above the X-tubes <b>22</b><i>a </i>and <b>22</b><i>b</i>. Thus, similar to the playard <b>10</b><i>a</i>, the playard <b>10</b><i>b </i>includes webbing <b>14</b> that is directly coupled to the leg support assemblies <b>24</b> as an additional support structure. When the frame <b>46</b> of the playard <b>10</b><i>b </i>is unfolded, the webbing <b>14</b> is once again pulled taut to form a top rail and thereby provide a more rigid boundary spanning the top portions <b>47</b> of the interior space. It should be appreciated that without the webbing <b>14</b>, the playards <b>10</b><i>a </i>and <b>10</b><i>b </i>are unlikely to comply with various consumer safety standards, such as ASTM F406-19.</p>
<p id="p-0013" num="0012">As noted above in connection with <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b>C</figref>, the playard <b>10</b><i>c </i>includes rigid top rails <b>32</b> that connect adjacent legs <b>30</b>. In this manner, the frame <b>46</b> of the playard <b>10</b><i>c </i>provides mechanical support structures that span the top and side boundaries of the interior space <b>11</b>. However, a frame that only has vertical or nearly vertical legs and top rails is often prone to mechanical instability. For example, the frame may tilt to one side due to the bottom portion of the legs being mechanically unconstrained and/or due to backlash or slop between the joints connecting the rails and the legs together. This mechanical instability may be further exacerbated if the legs and the rails are configured to move relative to one another, e.g., to facilitate folding of the playard. Given this mechanical instability, to reinforce the frame <b>46</b> the playard <b>10</b><i>c </i>includes an additional bottom support structure <b>34</b> that connects the legs <b>30</b> located at opposing corners of the frame <b>46</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0014" num="0013">The various support structures added to conventional playards as discussed above, and the various modifications made to the playards to accommodate these support structures, increase the complexity, number of parts, and cost of these playards.</p>
<p id="p-0015" num="0014">For instance, the webbing <b>14</b> for the playards <b>10</b><i>a </i>and <b>10</b><i>b </i>needs to be sewn directly into the soft goods <b>12</b> or the X-frame assemblies <b>20</b><i>a </i>and <b>20</b><i>b</i>, and/or the leg support assemblies <b>24</b> need to incorporate additional structural features to directly attach to the soft webbing <b>14</b>&#x2014;both of which increase design complexity resulting in higher manufacturing costs. For the playard <b>10</b><i>c</i>, the rigid top rails <b>36</b> and the bottom support structure <b>34</b> need to include additional mechanisms (e.g., the hinge <b>36</b>, hinges connecting the various members of the bottom support structure <b>34</b>) to facilitate tear down and folding of the playard <b>10</b><i>c</i>, which increase the number of parts for manufacture and assembly. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b>D</figref>, these additional mechanisms also make it more difficult for the caregiver to setup and tear down the playard <b>10</b><i>c </i>by adding additional steps (e.g., steps &#x2018;A&#x2019; and &#x2018;B&#x2019;). In particular, the playard <b>10</b><i>c </i>is especially difficult to unfold since the playard <b>10</b><i>c </i>tends to tip over and/or partially collapse when partially unfolded.</p>
<p id="p-0016" num="0015">The Inventors also have recognized that conventional playards often include frames that compromise between the ease of folding and/or unfolding the frame and other aspects related to the practical use of the playard. For example, the playards <b>10</b><i>a </i>and <b>10</b><i>b </i>include X-frame assemblies <b>20</b><i>a </i>and <b>20</b><i>b</i>, respectively, which makes folding and/or unfolding the respective frames <b>46</b> appreciably easier for the caregiver. However, the X-frame assemblies <b>20</b><i>a </i>and <b>20</b><i>b </i>both span an appreciable portion (if not all) of the sides of the respective frames <b>46</b> as described above, which may interfere with the visibility of a child in the partially enclosed space <b>13</b> and thereby impede or obstruct a caregiver's ability to easily see the child in the playard.</p>
<p id="p-0017" num="0016">More specifically, with reference again to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b>A</figref>, the soft goods <b>14</b> in the playard <b>10</b><i>a </i>includes see-through portions along the sides of the partially enclosed space <b>13</b>, which are intended to allow the caregiver to see their child. However, the X-tubes <b>22</b><i>a </i>and <b>22</b><i>b </i>in the pivot-only X-frame assemblies <b>20</b><i>a </i>span the entire sides of the partially enclosed space <b>13</b>, thus obstructing the see-through portions of the soft goods <b>14</b> and, hence, limiting a caregiver's ability to visually check on their child in the partially enclosed space <b>13</b>. For the playard <b>10</b><i>b</i>, the pivot and slidable X-frame assemblies <b>20</b><i>b </i>do not span the entire sides of the partially enclosed space <b>13</b>. However, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b>B</figref> shows the combination of the X-frame assemblies <b>20</b><i>b </i>and the soft goods <b>14</b> instead covers nearly the top half of the partially enclosed space <b>13</b>, thus limiting the areas in which the caregiver can see into the partially enclosed space <b>13</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0018" num="0017">In another example, the frame <b>46</b> of the playard <b>10</b><i>c </i>allows the caregiver to readily see into the partially enclosed space <b>13</b> at the expense of using a more complicated folding/unfolding mechanism as described above. Indoor playards are also typically designed to be aesthetically pleasing for indoor settings (e.g., the indoor playard should match other indoor furniture), which can often lead to compromises in other areas such as ease of use. For instance, X-frame assemblies are often only used for outdoor playards because the appearance of X-tubes clashes with most indoor furniture.</p>
<p id="p-0019" num="0018">The Inventors further have observed that conventional playards often include complex latch mechanisms that are expensive to manufacture and difficult for consumers to use. For example, conventional playard frames that utilize pivot and slidable X-frame assemblies, such as the playard <b>10</b><i>b </i>shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b>B</figref>, often include multiple latch mechanisms disposed on opposing sides of the playard to prevent any one side of the playard frame from sagging downwards when locked in the unfolded configuration. In particular, as noted above <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b>B</figref> shows the playard <b>10</b><i>b </i>includes a pair of latch mechanisms <b>16</b><i>a </i>and <b>16</b><i>b </i>disposed on opposing sides of the playard <b>10</b><i>b</i>. To lock or unlock the playard <b>10</b><i>b</i>, the caregiver needs to manually actuate each latch mechanism <b>16</b> one at a time, on different sides of the playard, which is inconvenient and cumbersome. In another example, the conventional indoor playard <b>10</b><i>c </i>shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b>C</figref> includes separate latch mechanisms for each hinge <b>36</b>. As described above, the caregiver needs to first lock each latch mechanism for each hinge <b>36</b> before unfolding the bottom support structure <b>34</b>, during which the playard <b>10</b><i>c </i>may tip over and/or partially collapse if not held up properly by the caregiver.</p>
<p id="p-0020" num="0019">The inclusion of multiple latch mechanisms increases the number of parts and, hence, the cost for manufacture. This drawback may be further exacerbated based on the placement and complexity of a given latch mechanism. For example, the latch mechanisms <b>16</b><i>a </i>and <b>16</b><i>b </i>in the playard <b>10</b><i>b </i>are mounted to the sliders of the leg support assemblies <b>24</b>; as a result, the playard <b>10</b><i>b </i>needs to include different types of sliders, i.e., the sliders <b>26</b><i>b </i>forming part of the latch mechanisms <b>16</b><i>a </i>and <b>16</b><i>b</i>, and the different sliders <b>26</b><i>a </i>for the remainder of the leg support assemblies <b>24</b>. Accordingly, this playard design increases the number of unique parts that need to be manufactured, which in turn increases manufacturing cost.</p>
<p id="p-0021" num="0020">The Inventors have also observed that conventional playards also include various accessories to augment the functionality and/or environment for the child. For instance, the playards <b>10</b><i>a </i>and <b>10</b><i>b </i>both include a canopy cover <b>40</b> to provide shade for a child when the playard is deployed in outdoor settings. However, the Inventors have recognized and appreciated that in some instances various accessories, and in particular canopy covers, often are prone to misuse and premature detachment from the playard, and/or may compromise the safety of the child.</p>
<p id="p-0022" num="0021">Generally, conventional canopy covers are supported by a separate canopy cover frame that directly mounts onto a top portion of the playard (e.g., the corners), which is already covered with soft goods. The presence of the soft goods can make it difficult for a caregiver to determine the proper location(s) on the playard where the canopy cover should be mounted, which can often result in incorrect canopy cover installations. Additionally, conventional canopy covers often are not attached securely to the playard due, in part, to the stack of multiple fabric layers in the soft goods. As a result, conventional canopy covers for outdoor playards are often prone to premature detachment due, for example, to a gust of wind.</p>
<p id="p-0023" num="0022">Conventional canopy covers are also prone to being detached by a child placed within the partially enclosed space of the playard. For example, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b>E</figref> shows the playard <b>10</b><i>a </i>of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b>A</figref> with the canopy cover <b>40</b> pulled off a corner <b>28</b> by a child in the playard. As shown, a canopy bow <b>44</b> supports the canopy cover <b>40</b> over the playard <b>10</b><i>a</i>. The canopy bow <b>44</b> is attached to a canopy clip <b>42</b>, which in turn should attach to the corner <b>28</b> covered by the soft goods <b>12</b>. However, the combination of the canopy clip <b>42</b> not being securely attached to the corner <b>28</b> and the child's accessibility to the canopy clip <b>42</b> can lead to the removal of the canopy cover <b>40</b> by the child as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b>E</figref>. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b>F</figref> shows another example where the child can further pull the canopy cover <b>40</b> into the partially enclosed space <b>13</b> of the playard <b>10</b><i>a </i>by pulling on the canopy bow <b>44</b> and/or the canopy clip <b>42</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0024" num="0023">In view of the foregoing observations by the Inventors, the present disclosure is thus directed to various inventive implementations of a foldable playard that is easier to operate (e.g., fold, unfold, latch and/or unlatch) as compared to conventional playards, structurally simpler with fewer parts for manufacture, and nonetheless sufficiently stable and rigid in structure so as to readily comply with various consumer safety standards (e.g., ASTM F406-19, referenced above).</p>
<p id="p-0025" num="0024">In various inventive implementations, a foldable playard may generally include a frame that defines an interior space when unfolded, and soft goods that are mounted to the frame and partially disposed within the interior space to define a partially enclosed space for a child. In some implementations, a foldable playard includes an improved canopy cover assembly to cover the partially enclosed space (e.g., when the playard is deployed in an outdoor setting).</p>
<p id="p-0026" num="0025">In one example of a frame for a foldable playard according to the present disclosure, the frame may be a closed frame that includes multiple leg support assemblies and X-frame assemblies arranged such that each leg support assembly is disposed along a side edge of the interior space, with the X-frame assemblies disposed between adjacent leg support assemblies along a side face of the interior space. The leg support assemblies enable the foldable playard to stand on the ground and the X-frame assemblies provide the structural support for the leg support assemblies as well as the mechanism to facilitate folding and/or unfolding of the playard. In some implementations, the leg support assemblies and the X-frame assemblies may define an interior space having a cross-section in the plane parallel to the ground that is polygonal in shape (e.g., a square, a rectangle, a hexagon).</p>
<p id="p-0027" num="0026">Each leg support assembly of the frame of a foldable playard may include a leg tube, a corner mounted to a top end of the leg tube, a foot mounted to a bottom end of the leg tube, and a slider that slides between the corner and the foot. The top and bottom ends of the leg tube may align with top and bottom vertices of the interior space, respectively. Each X-frame assembly may include at least one pair of X-tubes where each X-tube is rotatably coupled to at least another X-tube, the corner, and/or the slider. By coupling at least one of the X-tubes to the slider, the X-frame assembly becomes a pivot and slidable X-frame assembly in which the X-tubes are rotationally and translationally displaced when folding and/or unfolding the playard. In this manner, the combination of the X-frame assemblies and the leg support assemblies allows for a playard that folds into a smaller form occupying less volume and/or unfolds to provide a larger interior space and, hence, a larger partially enclosed space for the child as compared to conventional playards.</p>
<p id="p-0028" num="0027">In one aspect, the X-frame assemblies of the frame of the foldable playard may be positioned sufficiently near a top portion of the interior space when the playard is deployed in an unfolded configuration such that each X-frame assembly effectively functions as a rigid top rail that mechanically connects adjacent leg support assemblies in the frame. Said in another way, the respective X-tubes of each X-frame assembly form a top perimeter structure that spans the top of the playard frame, thus outlining a top opening of the interior space. For example, each pair of X-tubes in each X-frame assembly may form a sufficiently shallow X-frame structure such that the X-tubes are mechanically similar to the rigid top rails in previous playards (e.g., the top rail <b>32</b> in the playard <b>10</b><i>c</i>).</p>
<p id="p-0029" num="0028">However, unlike previous playards, the frames of the foldable playards disclosed herein are sufficiently rigid and stable with only X-frame assemblies coupling the leg support assemblies together. In other words, in example implementations, the frames of the foldable playards disclosed herein do not include a separate top rail (e.g., the webbing <b>14</b> of the playards <b>10</b><i>a </i>and <b>10</b><i>b </i>shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b>A</figref> and <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b>B</figref>, or the top rail <b>32</b> of the playard <b>10</b><i>c </i>shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b>C</figref>) or a bottom support structure (e.g., the bottom structure <b>34</b> of the playard <b>10</b><i>c </i>shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b>C</figref>). Accordingly, the innovative frames described herein result in a more refined playard with sound mechanical stability using fewer parts.</p>
<p id="p-0030" num="0029">In one aspect, the foldable playard frames disclosed in various examples herein achieve mechanical stability using fewer parts by reducing the length of the leg tubes as compared to conventional playards so as to make the frames less prone to being tilted and/or rotated (e.g., the resultant torque applied to a frame for a given force is reduced due to a shorter moment arm). As explained in greater detail below, in some implementations the length of a leg tube may be dimensioned based only on the portions of the foot and the corner that overlap with the leg tube and the distance the slider travels to sufficiently fold and/or unfold the frame.</p>
<p id="p-0031" num="0030">Additionally, the dimensions and/or materials of the X-tubes employed in foldable playard frames disclosed in various examples herein may be chosen to provide sufficient mechanical rigidity to the frame. For example, the X-tubes may be formed from steel tubing with an exterior diameter of about 0.625 inches and a total length of about 24.5 inches. However, it should be appreciated the X-tubes may be formed from other materials (e.g., aluminum, carbon fiber) having different dimensions depending, in part, on the mechanical properties of the material and the desired dimensions of the interior space provided by the frame. In some implementations, as noted above, a frame comprising only leg support assemblies and X-frame assemblies as disclosed herein, without additional support structures, may satisfy the various mechanical rigidity, stability, and/or strength requirements set forth in various consumer safety standards (e.g., ASTM F406-19, 7.3.3, 7.11).</p>
<p id="p-0032" num="0031">It should be appreciated that soft goods may be coupled at various points along the frame so that the partially enclosed space formed by the soft goods opens properly when the playard is unfolded. However, the soft goods may generally be a compliant, flexible component that remains loose instead of being pulled taut and, hence, does not appreciably improve the mechanical rigidity and/or stability of the frame.</p>
<p id="p-0033" num="0032">Additionally, by placing the X-frame assemblies of the frame near the top portion of the interior space, the sides of the frame are more exposed to provide a larger window for the caregiver to see their child when the child is placed within the interior space. Furthermore, soft goods attached to the frame may more readily cover the X-frame assemblies using less material. In some implementations, the soft goods may partially cover the X-frame assemblies to provide access to a latch mechanism (described in more detail below), while in other implementations the soft goods may completely cover the X-frame assemblies such that no portion of the X-frame assemblies are observable when the playard is unfolded (which may improve, in part, the aesthetic appearance of the playard for both outdoor and indoor settings).</p>
<p id="p-0034" num="0033">As discussed in greater detail below, the &#x201c;top portion&#x201d; of foldable playard frame in a given example implementation may generally refer to the portion of the frame proximate to the top ends of the leg tubes and/or the corners of each leg support assembly. The leg tubes of the respective leg support assemblies may generally have substantially identical lengths. In some implementations, the top portion of the frame may be defined as having: 1) a top horizontal plane that intersects the top ends of the leg tubes and/or the corners; and 2) a bottom horizontal plane that is offset vertically from the top horizontal plane such that the X-tubes are located entirely within the top and bottom horizontal planes when the X-frame assembly is unfolded. In some implementations, the bottom horizontal plane may be offset from the top horizontal plane by a distance less than or equal to 30% of the total length of the leg tubes and, more preferably, less than or equal to 20% of the total length of the leg tubes.</p>
<p id="p-0035" num="0034">As noted above, in some implementations a foldable playard frame may include one or more X-frame assemblies forming a single X-frame structure with one pair of X-tubes. Each X-tube in the pair of X-tubes may be rotatably coupled to a corner of one leg support assembly, a slider of another leg support assembly, and the other X-tube in the pair of X-tubes. In other example implementations, a foldable playard frame may include one or more X-frame assemblies forming a double X-frame structure with two pairs of X-tubes. In examples employing this double X-frame structure, each X-tube is coupled to either a slider or a corner of one leg support, the X-tube within the same pair of X-tubes, and another X-tube from another pair of X-tubes. In this manner, the frame may provide an interior space having a horizontal cross section in which the sides have different dimensions (e.g., an interior space with a rectangular shape).</p>
<p id="p-0036" num="0035">In another aspect, a foldable playard frame according to the present disclosure may include a latch mechanism to maintain the frame in an unfolded configuration. In some implementations, the frame may only include a single latch mechanism to maintain the frame in the unfolded configuration. In some implementations, the single latch mechanism is configured such that, as a caregiver unfolds the frame (e.g., by moving the slider in one leg support assembly towards the corner), the single latch mechanism is automatically actuated to lock the frame in the unfolded configuration. In this manner, the process of unfolding and locking the playard may be readily accomplished with the caregiver positioned at one side and/or one corner of the playard (i.e., the caregiver does not have to move around the playard to actuate multiple latch mechanisms). Furthermore, the caregiver may unfold and lock the playard using a single hand. For example, the single latch mechanism may automatically lock when the slider is displaced a sufficient distance along the leg tube.</p>
<p id="p-0037" num="0036">In some implementations, the latch mechanism may be preferably disposed in the top portion of the frame as defined above. For example, the latch mechanism may include a latch member having a first end coupled to the corner of one leg support assembly and a second end that couples to a X-tube of one X-frame assembly or the slider. In this manner, the latch mechanism may be partially covered or, in some instances, fully covered by the soft goods.</p>
<p id="p-0038" num="0037">The latch mechanism may also be coupled to various components of the frame including, but not limited to, an X-tube, a leg tube, a slider, and a corner. In some implementations, the latch mechanism may be coupled to the components of the X-frame assembly and/or the leg support assembly without having to modify the respective components of the X-frame assembly and the leg support assembly. For example, the latch mechanism may include a latch member that is rotatably coupled to the corner of one leg support assembly via a pin joint that also serves to rotatably couple an X-tube to the corner. In this manner, the playard may include a smaller number of unique parts for manufacture. In some implementations, the playard may include identical corners and/or identical sliders for the multiple leg support assemblies.</p>
<p id="p-0039" num="0038">In some implementations, the latch mechanism may be a tool-less mechanism that is actuated in one or two steps by the caregiver. In one example, the latch member may couple respective components of the X-frame assembly and/or the leg support assembly to maintain an unfolded configuration via various attachment mechanisms including, but not limited to, a snap-fit connection, a spring-loaded pin, and a spring-loaded rotational lock off mechanism.</p>
<p id="p-0040" num="0039">In some implementations, the latch mechanism may be a double-action latch that includes a latch member (e.g., mounted to the corner of one leg support assembly) and a latch boss (e.g., mounted to a X-tube of one X-frame assembly). The latch boss may include an undercut portion and the latch member may include a latch opening to receive the latch boss with a tab disposed within the latch opening to engage the undercut portion. In some implementations, the tab may include a slot and the undercut portion may include a rib to align the latch member and the latch boss when locking the latch mechanism. The undercut portion and the tab may be shaped such that the caregiver is unable to unlock the latch mechanism by pulling the latch member without applying an excessive amount of force (e.g., greater than 10 lbs of force). Instead, the caregiver may first squeeze the respective X-tubes of the X-frame assembly to displace the latch boss within the latch opening of the latch member to disengage the tab from the undercut portion. While squeezing the X-tubes together, the caregiver may then pull the latch member off the latch boss, thus unlocking the latch mechanism.</p>
<p id="p-0041" num="0040">In yet another aspect, the foldable playard may include soft goods to define the partially enclosed space in which the child may play and/or sleep. Generally, the soft goods may cover a portion of the frame (e.g., the corners of the leg support assembly, a portion of the X-frame assemblies). In some implementations, the soft goods may be coupled directly to the frame (e.g., a corner) via one or more snap-fit connections. The soft goods may further include a semi-rigid tab disposed near the top edge of the soft goods to support a snap-fit connector to ensure the soft goods remain flush against the frame when attached (i.e., the top edge of the soft goods does not flip upwards to expose an interior portion of the soft goods). The soft goods may further include a floor portion that directly rests on the ground, as well as side portions, where the floor and side portions define the bottom and sides of the partially enclosed space. In some implementations, the side portions may be transparent and/or see-through (e.g., a mesh) to allow the caregiver to readily see their child in the playard.</p>
<p id="p-0042" num="0041">In yet another aspect, a foldable playard according to the present disclosure may also include a canopy cover assembly, disposed on top of the playard frame and soft goods, to provide shade for the child within the playard. The canopy cover assembly may generally include multiple canopy support assemblies that provide a canopy cover frame or support structure. Each canopy support assembly may generally include a canopy bow that supports the canopy cover and a canopy clip to mount the canopy support assembly to the frame. In some implementations, different types of canopies (e.g., a half canopy, a full canopy) may be mounted onto the playard depending on the coverage desired by the caregiver.</p>
<p id="p-0043" num="0042">In some implementations, the canopy clip may include snap-in features to directly couple the canopy clip the leg tube of one leg support assembly. In this manner, the canopy clip may be more securely attached to the frame (i.e., the canopy clip does not attach to a portion of the frame covered by soft goods), thereby reducing the likelihood the canopy cover assembly is accidentally detached from the frame. Each canopy clip may be further disposed outside the interior space along an exterior portion of one leg support assembly (e.g., proximate to the corner and/or the slider when the playard is unfolded). Additionally, the canopy bow may couple to the canopy clip such that a portion of the canopy bow is also disposed outside the interior space near the corner and/or the slider of the leg support assembly. The particular placement of the canopy clip and the portion of the canopy bow that overlaps the exterior portion of the frame may further limit the child's access to the various components of the canopy cover assembly, thus reducing the likelihood the child can detach and pull the canopy cover into the playard.</p>
<p id="p-0044" num="0043">In one example, a frame for a foldable playard has a compact folded configuration for storage of the frame and a deployed unfolded configuration to support the foldable playard in an upright position on a ground surface to contain a child in an interior space of the foldable playard. The frame includes a plurality of leg support assemblies extending upward from the ground surface when the frame is in the deployed unfolded configuration where each leg support assembly of the plurality of leg support assemblies includes a bottom end supported by the ground surface and a top portion opposite to the bottom end. The frame further includes a plurality of X-frame assemblies coupled to the plurality of leg support assemblies where each X-frame assembly of the plurality of X-frame assemblies is coupled to respective top portions of adjacent leg support assemblies of the plurality of leg support assemblies when the frame is in the deployed unfolded configuration such that, in the deployed unfolded configuration of the frame, the plurality of X-frame assemblies forms a top perimeter structure of the frame outlining the interior space of the foldable playard and the plurality of X-frame assemblies does not significantly impede visibility of the child when the child is in the interior space of the foldable playard. The plurality of X-frame assemblies constitutes the only interconnection in the frame between respective pairs of leg support assemblies of the plurality of leg support assemblies. Each leg support assembly may include a leg tube with an oval-shaped cross-section.</p>
<p id="p-0045" num="0044">In another example, a foldable playard defining an interior space when in an unfolded configuration includes a plurality of leg support assemblies where each leg support assembly includes a leg tube disposed along a side edge of the interior space having a top end disposed at a top vertex of the interior space, a corner coupled to the top end of the leg tube, and a slider slidably coupled to the leg tube such that the slider is disposed proximate to the corner when the foldable playard is in the unfolded configuration. The foldable playard further includes a plurality of X-frame assemblies positioned at respective side faces of the interior space between adjacent leg support assemblies where each X-frame assembly of the plurality of X-frame assemblies forms a top rail between adjacent leg support assemblies. Additionally, the sliders in the plurality of leg support assemblies are identical, the corners in the plurality of leg support assemblies are identical, and respective pairs of leg support assemblies are only coupled together via at least one X-frame assembly of the plurality of X-frame assemblies. The leg tube may also have an oval-shaped cross-section.</p>
<p id="p-0046" num="0045">In another example, a foldable playard defining an interior space when in an unfolded configuration includes a plurality of leg support assemblies where each leg support assembly includes a leg tube disposed along a side edge of the interior space having a top end disposed at a top vertex of the interior space, a corner coupled to the top end of the leg tube, and a slider slidably coupled to the leg tube such that the slider is disposed proximate to the corner when the foldable playard is in the unfolded configuration. The foldable playard further includes a plurality of X-frame assemblies positioned at respective side faces of the interior space between adjacent leg support assemblies of the plurality of leg support assemblies where each X-frame assembly of the plurality of X-frame assemblies forms a top rail between the adjacent leg support assemblies. The foldable playard further includes a single latch mechanism coupled to one leg support assembly of the plurality of leg support assemblies to maintain the foldable playard in the unfolded configuration when the latch mechanism is in a locked configuration. Additionally, respective pairs of adjacent leg support assemblies are only coupled together via one X-frame assembly of the plurality of X-frame assemblies. The leg tube may also have an oval-shaped cross-section.</p>
<p id="p-0047" num="0046">In another example, a foldable playard defining an interior space when in an unfolded configuration includes a plurality of leg support assemblies where each leg support assembly includes a leg tube disposed along a side edge of the interior space having a top end disposed at a top vertex of the interior space, a corner disposed on the top end of the leg tube, and a slider slidably coupled to the leg tube such that the slider is disposed proximate to the corner when the foldable playard is in the unfolded configuration. The foldable playard further includes a plurality of X-frame assemblies positioned at respective side faces of the interior space where each X-frame assembly of the plurality of X-frame assemblies is coupled to adjacent leg support assemblies of the plurality of leg support assemblies. The foldable playard further includes a latch mechanism that directly couples together the corner of one leg support assembly of the plurality of leg support assemblies and a X-tube of one X-frame assembly of the plurality of X-frame assemblies when the latch mechanism is in a locked configuration where the latch mechanism provides the only mechanism to maintain the foldable playard in the unfolded configuration. Additionally, respective pairs of leg support assemblies are only coupled together via at least one X-frame assembly of the plurality of X-frame assemblies. The leg tube may also have an oval-shaped cross-section.</p>
<p id="p-0048" num="0047">In another example, a foldable playard defining an interior space when in an unfolded configuration includes a plurality of leg support assemblies where each leg support assembly includes a leg tube disposed along a side edge of the interior space having a top end disposed at a top vertex of the interior space, a corner coupled to the top end of the leg tube, and a slider slidably coupled to the leg tube such that the slider is disposed proximate to the corner when the foldable playard is in the unfolded configuration. The foldable playard further includes a plurality of X-frame assemblies positioned at respective side faces of the interior space where each X-frame assembly of the plurality of X-frame assemblies is coupled to adjacent leg support assemblies. The foldable playard further includes a plurality of canopy support assemblies disposed, in part, above the interior space where each canopy support assembly includes a canopy bow disposed, in part, above the interior space and a canopy clip disposed outside the interior space proximate to a first leg support assembly of the plurality of leg support assemblies. The canopy clip includes one or more snap features directly coupled to the leg tube of the first leg support assembly and a canopy bow opening to receive a portion of the canopy bow to couple the canopy bow to the canopy clip. The foldable playard also includes a canopy cover supported by respective canopy bows of the plurality of canopy support assemblies to cover at least a portion of the interior space.</p>
<p id="p-0049" num="0048">In another example, a foldable playard includes a leg support assembly. The leg support includes a leg tube having a top end, a corner disposed on the top end of the leg tube, and a slider slidably coupled to the leg tube. The foldable playard further includes a X-frame assembly coupled to the leg support assembly where the X-frame assembly includes a first X-tube rotatably coupled to the corner of the leg support assembly and a second X-tube rotatably coupled to the slider of the leg support assembly and the first X-tube. The foldable playard further includes a latch mechanism coupled to the leg support assembly and the X-frame assembly to maintain the foldable playard in an unfolded configuration when in a locked configuration where the latch mechanism includes a latch boss coupled to the second X-tube and disposed proximate to the slider of the leg support assembly having an undercut portion and a latch member coupled to the corner of the leg support assembly having a latch opening and a tab disposed within the latch opening. The undercut portion of the latch boss retains the tab of the latch member when the latch mechanism is engaged thereby maintaining the foldable playard in the unfolded configuration.</p>
<p id="p-0050" num="0049">In yet another example, a foldable playard defining an interior space with a cross-sectional shape, in a plane parallel to a ground, forming a regular hexagon when in an unfolded configuration, includes six leg support assemblies. Each leg support assembly includes a leg tube arranged such that a longitudinal axis associated with the leg tube intersects a respective corner of the regular hexagon and further has a top end and a bottom end, a foot coupled to the bottom end of the leg tube to contact a ground to support the foldable playard, a corner coupled to the top end of the leg tube, and a slider slidably coupled to the leg tube and positioned between the foot and the corner where the slider is disposed proximate to the corner when the foldable playard is in the unfolded configuration and disposed proximate to the foot when the foldable playard is in a folded configuration. The foldable playard further includes six X-frame assemblies arranged such that each X-frame assembly is positioned along a side of the regular hexagon. Each X-frame assembly of the six X-frame assemblies forms a top rail between adjacent leg support assemblies. The six X-frame assemblies includes a first X-frame assembly disposed between and coupled to a first leg support assembly and a second leg support assembly of the six leg support assemblies where the first X-frame assembly includes a first X-tube having a first end rotatably coupled to the corner of the first leg support assembly and a second end rotatably coupled to the slider of the second leg support assembly and a second X-tube having a first end rotatably coupled to the corner of the second leg support assembly and a second end rotatably coupled to the slider of the first leg support assembly. The second X-tube is rotatably coupled to the first X-tube. The foldable playard further includes a latch mechanism coupled to only the first leg support assembly and only the first X-frame assembly to maintain the foldable playard in the unfolded configuration when in a locked configuration where the latch mechanism includes a latch boss coupled to one of the second X-tube and disposed proximate to the slider of the first leg support assembly having an undercut portion and a latch member having a first end coupled to the corner of the first leg support assembly, a latch opening disposed proximate to a pulling tab, and a tab disposed within the latch opening. The latch mechanism is changed to the locked configuration by moving the slider of the first leg support assembly towards the corner of the first leg support assembly until the latch member snaps onto the latch boss such that the tab of the latch member contacts the undercut portion of the latch boss and the central rib is disposed within the central slot. The latch mechanism is changed to an unlocked configuration by squeezing the first and second X-tubes together to release the tab of the latch member from the undercut portion of the latch boss and, while squeezing the first and second X-tubes together, pulling the latch member away from the latch boss. Additionally, respective pairs of leg support assemblies are only coupled together via at least one X-frame assembly of the plurality of X-frame assemblies, the sliders in the six leg support assemblies are identical, and the corners in the six leg support assemblies are identical.</p>

<heading id="h-0005" level="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION</heading>
<p id="p-0184" num="0183">Following below are more detailed descriptions of various concepts related to, and implementations of, foldable playards that include; 1) a mechanically-sound rigid frame with a simpler construction compared to conventional playards that is easier to operate; 2) soft goods attached to the frame to provide a partially enclosed space for the child; and optionally 3) a canopy cover assembly mounted to the frame to provide shade for the child. It should be appreciated that various concepts introduced above and discussed in greater detail below may be implemented in multiple ways. Examples of specific implementations and applications are provided primarily for illustrative purposes so as to enable those skilled in the art to practice the implementations and alternatives apparent to those skilled in the art.</p>
<p id="p-0185" num="0184">The figures and example implementations described below are not meant to limit the scope of the present implementations to a single embodiment. Other implementations are possible by way of interchange of some or all of the described or illustrated elements. Moreover, where certain elements of the disclosed example implementations may be partially or fully implemented using known components, in some instances only those portions of such known components that are necessary for an understanding of the present implementations are described, and detailed descriptions of other portions of such known components are omitted so as not to obscure the present implementations.</p>
<p id="p-0186" num="0185">In the discussion below, various examples of inventive foldable playards are provided, wherein a given example or set of examples showcases one or more particular features of a frame, a X-frame assembly, a leg support assembly, a latch mechanism, soft goods, and a canopy cover assembly. It should be appreciated that one or more features discussed in connection with a given example of a foldable playard may be employed in other examples of foldable playards according to the present disclosure, such that the various features disclosed herein may be readily combined in a given foldable playard according to the present disclosure (provided that respective features are not mutually inconsistent).</p>
<p id="p-0187" num="0186">Certain dimensions and features of the foldable playard are described herein using the terms &#x201c;approximately,&#x201d; &#x201c;about,&#x201d; &#x201c;substantially,&#x201d; and/or &#x201c;similar.&#x201d; As used herein, the terms &#x201c;approximately,&#x201d; &#x201c;about,&#x201d; &#x201c;substantially,&#x201d; and/or &#x201c;similar&#x201d; indicates that each of the described dimensions or features is not a strict boundary or parameter and does not exclude functionally similar variations therefrom. Unless context or the description indicates otherwise, the use of the terms &#x201c;approximately,&#x201d; &#x201c;about,&#x201d; &#x201c;substantially,&#x201d; and/or &#x201c;similar&#x201d; in connection with a numerical parameter indicates that the numerical parameter includes variations that, using mathematical and industrial principles accepted in the art (e.g., rounding, measurement or other systematic errors, manufacturing tolerances, etc.), would not vary the least significant digit.</p>
<p id="p-0188" num="0000">An Exemplary Foldable Playard with X-Frame Assemblies</p>
<p id="p-0189" num="0187"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>2</b>A-<b>2</b>C</figref> show an exemplary frame <b>100</b><i>a </i>for a foldable playard in an unfolded configuration. As shown, the frame <b>100</b><i>a </i>may include multiple leg support assemblies <b>110</b><i>a </i>and multiple X-frame assemblies <b>140</b><i>a </i>that are arranged to outline and define an interior space <b>102</b>. In particular, each leg support assembly <b>110</b><i>a </i>may be coupled to another adjacent leg support assembly <b>110</b><i>a </i>via a X-frame assembly <b>140</b><i>a </i>to form a closed frame structure (e.g., a frame that surrounds and separates the interior space <b>102</b> from the surrounding environment). As discussed further below in connection with <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b>A</figref>, in addition to the frame <b>100</b><i>a</i>, a foldable playard <b>1000</b><i>a </i>also includes soft goods <b>300</b> that are partially disposed within the interior space <b>102</b> to provide a padded, partially enclosed space <b>301</b> to contain a child <b>50</b>. The soft goods <b>300</b> will be described in more detail below.</p>
<p id="p-0190" num="0188">With reference again to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b>A</figref>, the leg support assemblies <b>110</b><i>a </i>of the frame <b>100</b><i>a </i>may provide vertical or nearly vertical support stands that define the spatial extent of the interior space <b>102</b> in the unfolded configuration. In other words, the leg support assemblies <b>110</b><i>a </i>may define and/or otherwise be disposed along side edges <b>104</b> of the interior space <b>102</b>. The X-frame assemblies <b>140</b><i>a </i>may provide the structural support to position and orient the leg support assemblies <b>110</b><i>a </i>as desired, as well as provide a mechanism to facilitate folding and/or unfolding of the frame <b>100</b><i>a</i>. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b>A</figref>, each X-frame assembly <b>140</b><i>a </i>may define and/or otherwise be disposed on a side face <b>106</b> of the interior space <b>102</b> between adjacent side edges <b>104</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0191" num="0189">For the frame <b>100</b><i>a </i>shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>2</b>A-<b>2</b>C</figref>, the interior space <b>102</b> has a horizontal cross-section (i.e., a cross-section in a plane parallel to a ground <b>90</b> supporting the frame <b>100</b><i>a</i>) shaped as a regular hexagon. However, it should be appreciated that in other implementations disclosed herein and discussed in further detail below, the number of leg support assemblies <b>110</b><i>a </i>and/or X-frame assemblies <b>140</b><i>a </i>may be adjusted to form interior spaces <b>102</b> with different horizontal cross-sectional shapes including, but not limited to a square, a rectangle, a pentagon, a hexagon, an octagon, a regular polygon, and an irregular polygon (i.e., the sides have different dimensions).</p>
<p id="p-0192" num="0190">In some implementations, the interior space <b>102</b> may further form a three-dimensional volume shaped as a right prism. Said in another way, the leg support assemblies <b>110</b><i>a </i>may be vertically oriented such that the horizontal cross-section of the interior space <b>102</b> is identical or substantially identical in shape and dimensions at any vertical position along the length of the leg support assemblies <b>110</b><i>a</i>. In other implementations, the interior space <b>102</b> may form a three-dimensional volume shaped as a truncated pyramid where a bottom portion of the interior space <b>102</b> near the ground <b>90</b> is larger than a top portion of the interior space <b>102</b>. Said in another way, the leg support assemblies <b>110</b><i>a </i>may be tilted when the frame <b>100</b><i>a </i>is deployed such that the top portions of the leg support assemblies <b>110</b><i>a </i>are positioned closer together than a bottom portion of the leg support assemblies <b>110</b><i>a </i>so that the area of the horizontal cross-section of the interior space <b>102</b> decreases from the bottom portion to the top portion of the leg support assemblies <b>110</b><i>a </i>if the leg support assemblies <b>110</b><i>a </i>are substantially straight in shape. In one aspect, a frame <b>100</b><i>a </i>forming a truncated pyramidal interior space <b>102</b> may be preferable for enhancing mechanical stability. The manner in which this geometry is achieved will be discussed in more detail below.</p>
<p id="p-0193" num="0191">In the frame <b>100</b><i>a </i>shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b>A</figref>, each leg support assembly <b>110</b><i>a </i>may include a leg tube <b>112</b> having a top end <b>113</b><i>a </i>and a bottom end <b>113</b><i>b </i>(see, for example, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b>A</figref>), a foot <b>114</b> coupled to the bottom end <b>113</b><i>b </i>to support the frame <b>100</b><i>a </i>on the ground <b>90</b>, a corner <b>130</b> coupled to the top end <b>113</b><i>a </i>of the leg tube <b>112</b>, and a slider <b>120</b> that is slidably coupled to the leg tube <b>112</b> and positioned between the foot <b>114</b> and the corner <b>130</b>. The top end <b>113</b><i>a </i>of the leg tube <b>112</b> and/or the corner <b>130</b> may coincide with a top vertex <b>105</b> of the interior space <b>102</b> and the bottom end <b>113</b><i>b </i>of the leg tube <b>112</b> and/or the foot <b>114</b> may coincide with a bottom vertex <b>107</b> of the interior space <b>102</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0194" num="0192">In this implementation, each X-frame assembly <b>140</b><i>a </i>may include a pair of X-tubes <b>142</b><i>a </i>and <b>142</b><i>b </i>that are arranged to cross one another to form a single X-shaped structure. The X-tubes <b>142</b><i>a </i>and <b>142</b><i>b </i>may be rotatably coupled to each other and to respective corners <b>130</b> and sliders <b>120</b> of adjacent leg support assemblies <b>110</b><i>a</i>. Thus, the X-frame assemblies <b>140</b><i>a </i>are pivot and slidable X-frame assemblies where the X-tubes <b>142</b><i>a </i>and <b>142</b><i>b </i>rotate relative to each other and the leg support assemblies <b>110</b><i>a </i>and translate relative to the leg tubes <b>112</b> via movement of the sliders <b>120</b>. This enables the frame <b>100</b><i>a </i>to be folded into a more compact structure that occupies less volume and/or allows for a larger interior space <b>102</b> compared to, for example, conventional playards with pivot-only X-frame assemblies.</p>
<p id="p-0195" num="0193">In some implementations, the manner in which the multiple X-frame assemblies <b>140</b><i>a </i>and the leg support assemblies <b>110</b><i>a </i>are coupled to each other may enable a caregiver to fold and/or unfold the frame <b>100</b><i>a </i>in a single step. For example, the caregiver may unfold the frame <b>100</b><i>a </i>by moving the slider <b>120</b> in one leg support assembly <b>110</b><i>a </i>towards the corner <b>130</b>. The motion of the slider <b>120</b>, in turn, causes the adjoining X-frame assemblies <b>140</b><i>a </i>to rotate and translate. The motion of the adjoining X-frame assemblies <b>140</b><i>a</i>, in turn, causes the sliders <b>120</b> in the adjacent leg support assemblies <b>110</b><i>a </i>to move in a similar manner. This process may occur simultaneously for all X-frame assemblies <b>140</b><i>a </i>and all sliders <b>120</b> resulting in the frame <b>100</b><i>a </i>being unfolded as the caregiver moves the slider <b>120</b> for the one leg support assembly <b>110</b><i>a</i>. Once the frame <b>100</b><i>a </i>is unfolded, a latch mechanism <b>200</b><i>a</i>, which will be described in more detail below, may be actuated to lock the frame <b>100</b><i>a </i>in the unfolded configuration (e.g., the latch mechanism <b>200</b><i>a </i>prevents the sliders <b>120</b> from sliding back down the respective leg tubes <b>112</b> towards the feet <b>114</b>).</p>
<p id="p-0196" num="0194">In some implementations, the frame <b>100</b><i>a </i>may be folded and/or unfolded with the feet <b>114</b> of the leg support assemblies <b>110</b><i>a </i>remaining in contact with the ground <b>90</b>. The leg tubes <b>112</b> may also remain vertically upright or nearly vertically upright (e.g., leg tubes <b>112</b> may intentionally be tilted when the frame <b>100</b><i>a </i>is unfolded to improve stability) as the frame <b>100</b><i>a </i>is folded and/or unfolded. In this manner, the process of folding and/or unfolding the frame <b>100</b><i>a </i>may be made easier for the caregiver. For example, the caregiver would not have to balance the frame <b>100</b><i>a </i>from tipping over while setting up and/or tearing down the playard <b>1000</b><i>a. </i></p>
<p id="p-0197" num="0195">With reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b>B</figref>, in some implementations, the X-tubes <b>142</b><i>a </i>and <b>142</b><i>b </i>of each X-frame assembly <b>140</b><i>a </i>may be positioned within a top portion <b>108</b> of the frame <b>100</b><i>a </i>and/or the interior space <b>102</b> when the frame <b>100</b><i>a </i>is unfolded. Said in another way, the X-frame assemblies <b>140</b><i>a </i>may form a perimeter structure around the top portion <b>108</b> of the frame <b>100</b><i>a </i>that outlines the horizontal cross section of the top opening of the interior space <b>102</b>. For example, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b>C</figref> shows the X-frame assemblies <b>140</b><i>a </i>form a top perimeter structure <b>109</b> that outlines a regular hexagon corresponding to the shape of the interior space <b>102</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0198" num="0196">Positioning the X-tubes <b>142</b><i>a </i>and <b>142</b><i>b </i>in the top portion <b>108</b> of the frame when the frame is in the unfolded configuration provides several benefits to the frame <b>100</b><i>a </i>and, in turn, to a foldable playard comprising the frame <b>100</b><i>a. </i></p>
<p id="p-0199" num="0197">First, each X-frame assembly <b>140</b><i>a </i>in the frame <b>100</b><i>a </i>may function as a top rail that couples together two adjacent leg support assemblies <b>110</b><i>a </i>and provides mechanical rigidity and stability to the frame <b>100</b><i>a</i>. Said in another way, the X-frame assembly <b>140</b><i>a </i>may be unfolded to such an extent that the X-tubes <b>142</b><i>a </i>and <b>142</b><i>b </i>form a shallow X-frame structure in the top portion <b>108</b> of the frame that effectively functions as a rigid top rail. For example, in the limit where the respective sliders <b>120</b> are positioned proximate to the respective corners <b>130</b> in adjacent leg support assemblies <b>110</b><i>a</i>, the X-tubes <b>142</b><i>a </i>and <b>142</b><i>b </i>may be in near parallel alignment with one another when viewing the frame <b>100</b><i>a </i>from the side or the front. Thus, each X-tube <b>142</b><i>a </i>and <b>142</b><i>b </i>may separately function as a top rail.</p>
<p id="p-0200" num="0198">In some implementations, the leg support assemblies <b>110</b><i>a </i>may only be coupled to one another via the X-frame assemblies <b>140</b><i>a</i>. In other words, the frame <b>100</b><i>a </i>may exclude other support structures, such as a separate compliant and/or rigid top rail (e.g., the webbing <b>14</b> of the playards <b>10</b><i>a </i>and <b>10</b><i>b </i>shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b>A</figref> and <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b>B</figref>, the rigid top rails <b>32</b> of the playard <b>10</b><i>c </i>shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b>C</figref>) or a bottom support structure (e.g., the bottom support structure <b>34</b> of the playard <b>10</b><i>c </i>shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b>C</figref>), which may appreciably reduce the number of parts for manufacture and assembly. For example, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>2</b>A-<b>2</b>C</figref>, the portion of the leg tubes <b>112</b> located between the bottom end <b>113</b><i>b </i>and the slider <b>120</b> when the frame <b>100</b><i>a </i>is unfolded may not be coupled to another portion of the frame <b>100</b><i>a </i>(e.g., the bottom portions of the leg tubes <b>112</b> are mechanically unconstrained).</p>
<p id="p-0201" num="0199">In some implementations, the frame <b>100</b><i>a</i>, comprising only leg support assemblies <b>110</b><i>a </i>and X-frame assemblies <b>140</b><i>a </i>to couple the leg support assemblies <b>110</b><i>a </i>together, may have sufficient mechanical rigidity, stability, and/or strength to meet the requirements set forth in various consumer safety standards (e.g., ASTM F406-19, 7.3.3, 7.11). For example, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>7</b>B</figref> shows the playard <b>1000</b><i>a </i>with the frame <b>100</b><i>a </i>unfolded and with soft goods <b>300</b> installed undergoing a stability test (e.g., ASTM F406-19, 5.12, 8.17). For this test, the playard <b>1000</b><i>a </i>was placed onto a flat piece of plywood and tilted at varying angles with a test weight disposed within the playard <b>1000</b><i>a </i>leaning against one side of the frame <b>100</b><i>a</i>. Based on this test, it was found the playard <b>1000</b><i>a </i>did not tip even when tilted at an angle of 20 degrees with at least three feet <b>114</b> remaining in contact with the plywood base. This result exceeds the requirements set forth in ASTM F406-19, 8.17, which require the playard to maintain three contact points with the plywood base when tilted to an angle of 10 degrees.</p>
<p id="p-0202" num="0200">This may be accomplished, in part, by tailoring the materials and/or dimensions of the X-tubes <b>142</b><i>a </i>and <b>142</b><i>b </i>to provide the mechanical properties that ensure the frame <b>100</b><i>a </i>is mechanically rigid and stable when deployed. For example, the X-tubes <b>142</b><i>a </i>and <b>142</b><i>b </i>may be formed from steel tubing with an outer diameter of about 0.625 inches (&#x215d; inches) and a total length of about 24.5 inches. The term &#x201c;about,&#x201d; when used to describe the dimensions of the X-tubes <b>142</b><i>a </i>and <b>142</b><i>b</i>, are intended to cover manufacturing tolerances. For example, &#x201c;about 0.625 inches&#x201d; may correspond to the following dimensional ranges: 0.61875 to 0.63125 inches (+/&#x2212;1% tolerance), 0.62 to 0.63 inches (+/&#x2212;0.8% tolerance), 0.62125 to 0.62875 inches (+/&#x2212;0.6% tolerance), 0.6225 to 0.6275 inches (+/&#x2212;0.4% tolerance), 0.62375 to 0.62625 inches (+/&#x2212;0.2% tolerance). Similar tolerances may be applied to describe the total length of the X-tubes <b>142</b><i>a </i>and <b>142</b><i>b. </i></p>
<p id="p-0203" num="0201">It should also be appreciated the X-tubes <b>142</b><i>a </i>and <b>142</b><i>b </i>may be formed from other materials including, but not limited to, aluminum and carbon fiber. The X-tubes <b>142</b> and <b>142</b><i>b </i>may also have different dimensions depending, in part, on the desired size of the frame <b>100</b><i>a </i>and/or the interior space <b>102</b> and the mechanical properties of the materials used to form the X-tubes <b>142</b><i>a </i>and <b>142</b><i>b</i>. In some implementations, the X-frame assemblies <b>140</b><i>a </i>may all have substantially identical or identical dimensions and/or shapes resulting in an interior space <b>102</b> with a horizontal cross-section shaped as a regular polygon. In some implementations, the frame <b>100</b><i>a </i>may include X-frame assemblies <b>140</b><i>a </i>having different dimensions and/or shapes resulting in an interior space <b>102</b> that is skewed in shape.</p>
<p id="p-0204" num="0202">Additionally, with reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b>B</figref>, the length L of the leg tubes <b>112</b>, defined as the distance between the top end <b>113</b><i>a </i>and the bottom end <b>113</b><i>b</i>, may generally be kept relatively small where possible in order to reduce the likelihood of the frame <b>100</b><i>a </i>being tilted especially when a force is applied along the top portion <b>108</b> of the frame <b>100</b><i>a</i>. For example, the length L may be chosen to ensure certain constraints on the frame <b>100</b><i>a </i>are satisfied. These constraints include: (1) providing a desired height for the interior space <b>102</b>; (2) providing sufficient overlap with the foot <b>114</b> and the corner <b>130</b> to couple the foot <b>114</b> and corner <b>130</b> to leg tube <b>112</b>; and/or (3) providing sufficient room for the slider <b>120</b> to move between the foot <b>114</b> and the corner <b>130</b> to fold and/or unfold the frame <b>100</b><i>a</i>. It should be appreciated that the lateral and vertical dimensions of the interior space <b>102</b> are coupled due, in part, to the rotational and translational motion of the X-frame assemblies <b>140</b><i>a </i>(e.g., an increase in the lateral dimensions of the interior space <b>102</b> results in a corresponding increase in the vertical dimensions to ensure the X-frame assemblies <b>140</b><i>a </i>have sufficient room to slide vertically along the leg tubes and hence fold).</p>
<p id="p-0205" num="0203">In some implementations, the length L of the leg tubes <b>112</b> may be about 26 inches. Similar to the dimensions of the X-tubes <b>142</b><i>a </i>and <b>142</b><i>b</i>, the term &#x201c;about,&#x201d; when used to describe the dimensions of the leg tube <b>112</b>, are intended to cover manufacturing tolerances. The tolerance values may be the same as the X-tubes <b>142</b><i>a </i>and <b>142</b><i>b</i>. In some implementations, the leg tubes <b>112</b> in the leg support assemblies <b>110</b><i>a </i>may be substantially identical or identical. In some implementations, the leg tubes <b>112</b> may have different shapes and/or dimensions (e.g., some leg tubes <b>112</b> may be vertically oriented while other leg tubes <b>112</b> may be tilted when the frame <b>100</b><i>a </i>is unfolded).</p>
<p id="p-0206" num="0204">Second, another benefit provided by positioning the X-tubes <b>142</b><i>a </i>and <b>142</b><i>b </i>in the top portion <b>108</b> of the frame when the frame is in the unfolded configuration is that the X-frame assemblies <b>140</b><i>a </i>occupy a smaller portion of the side faces <b>106</b> of the interior space <b>102</b> as compared to conventional playards with X-frame assemblies. When the soft goods <b>300</b> includes transparent and/or see-through side portions, the placement of the X-frame assemblies <b>140</b><i>a </i>in the top portion <b>108</b> of the frame allows for greater visibility of the partially enclosed space <b>301</b> when the soft goods <b>300</b> are coupled to the frame <b>100</b><i>a</i>. Said in another way, the X-frame assemblies <b>140</b><i>a </i>do not appreciable visually obstruct and/or impede the caregiver from seeing their child when the child <b>50</b> is in the playard <b>1000</b><i>a. </i></p>
<p id="p-0207" num="0205">Additionally, the soft goods <b>300</b> may use less material to cover the X-frame assemblies <b>140</b><i>a</i>. In some implementations, the soft goods <b>300</b> may cover the corners <b>130</b> of the leg support assemblies <b>110</b><i>a </i>and partially cover the X-frame assemblies <b>140</b><i>a </i>such that the latch mechanism <b>200</b><i>a</i>, when disposed in the top portion <b>108</b> of the frame <b>100</b><i>a</i>, remains accessible to the caregiver. In some implementations, the soft goods <b>300</b> may fully cover the X-frame assemblies <b>140</b><i>a </i>as well as the corners <b>130</b> and the sliders <b>120</b> of the leg support assemblies <b>110</b><i>a </i>such that an observer may only see the leg tubes <b>112</b> and/or the feet <b>114</b> of the leg support assemblies <b>110</b><i>a</i>. In this manner, the foldable playard <b>1000</b><i>a </i>may be presented with a cleaner, more aesthetically desirable appearance to a consumer, in both indoor and outdoor settings.</p>
<p id="p-0208" num="0206">As discussed above in connection with <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b>B</figref>, the top portion <b>108</b> may generally correspond to the portion of the frame <b>100</b><i>a </i>proximate to the top ends <b>113</b><i>a </i>of the leg tubes <b>112</b> and/or the corners <b>130</b> of each leg support assembly <b>110</b><i>a</i>. More specifically, the top portion <b>108</b> may be defined as the portion of the frame <b>100</b><i>a </i>located between a top horizontal plane <b>92</b> that intersects the top ends <b>113</b><i>a </i>of the leg tubes <b>112</b> and/or the corners <b>130</b> and a bottom horizontal plane <b>91</b> that is offset from the top horizontal plane <b>92</b> by an offset distance, xi, along the length of the respective leg tubes <b>112</b>. When the frame <b>100</b><i>a </i>is unfolded, the X-tubes <b>142</b><i>a </i>and <b>142</b><i>b</i>, the sliders <b>120</b>, and the corners <b>130</b> are disposed within the top portion <b>108</b>. The offset distance, xi, may be defined as a fraction of the total length L of the leg tube <b>112</b> assuming the leg tubes <b>112</b> in the frame <b>100</b><i>a </i>have identical lengths. In some implementations, the offset distance, xi, may be less than or equal to 30% of the total length, L, of the leg tubes <b>112</b> and, more preferably, less than or equal to 20% of the total length of the leg tubes <b>112</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0209" num="0207"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>3</b>A and <b>3</b>B</figref> show additional views of the X-frame assembly <b>140</b><i>a </i>in the frame <b>100</b><i>a</i>. As shown, the X-tubes <b>142</b><i>a </i>and <b>142</b><i>b </i>may be rotatably coupled to each other via a pin joint <b>145</b>. The X-tube <b>142</b><i>a </i>may have a first end <b>143</b><i>a </i>rotatably coupled to the corner <b>130</b> of one leg support assembly <b>110</b><i>a </i>via a pin joint <b>146</b><i>a </i>and a second end <b>143</b><i>b </i>rotatably coupled to the slider <b>120</b> of another leg support assembly <b>110</b><i>a </i>via a pin joint <b>146</b><i>b</i>. Similarly, the X-tube <b>142</b><i>b </i>may be rotatably coupled to the corner <b>130</b> of one leg support assembly <b>110</b><i>a </i>via a pin joint <b>146</b><i>d </i>and rotatably coupled to the slider <b>120</b> of another leg support assembly <b>110</b><i>a </i>via a pin joint <b>146</b><i>c. </i></p>
<p id="p-0210" num="0208">The pin joints <b>145</b> and <b>146</b><i>a</i>-<b>146</b><i>d </i>may generally include a fastener (not shown) with a shaft inserted through openings <b>147</b> (see <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b>B</figref>) on the X-tubes <b>142</b><i>a </i>and <b>142</b><i>b </i>to allow rotational motion between the X-tubes <b>142</b><i>a </i>and <b>142</b><i>b</i>, the sliders <b>120</b>, and the corners <b>130</b>. The fastener may be various types of captive fasteners including, but not limited to, a rivet with a cap (e.g., a rolled rivet) and a bolt fastener with a nut.</p>
<p id="p-0211" num="0209">Generally, the nominal dimensions and tolerances of the openings <b>147</b> and the shaft of the fastener affects the tightness or looseness of the pin joints <b>145</b> and <b>146</b><i>a</i>-<b>146</b><i>d</i>. If the opening <b>147</b> is dimensioned to interfere with the fastener (e.g., the size of the opening <b>147</b> is smaller than the size of the shaft of the fastener), the caregiver may have to apply a greater force to rotate the X-tubes <b>142</b><i>a </i>and <b>142</b><i>b</i>. In some instances, the pin joints <b>145</b> and <b>146</b><i>a</i>-<b>146</b><i>d </i>may be too tight such that the respective feet <b>114</b> of each leg support assembly <b>110</b><i>a </i>do not contact the ground <b>90</b> when the frame <b>100</b><i>a </i>is unfolded. For example, the caregiver may move the slider <b>120</b> of one leg support assembly <b>110</b><i>a </i>towards the corresponding corner <b>130</b>, but the opposing sides of the frame <b>100</b><i>a </i>may only be partially unfolded. In contrast, if the size of the opening <b>147</b> is appreciably larger than the fastener shaft, the pin joints <b>145</b> and <b>146</b><i>a</i>-<b>146</b><i>d </i>may allow the X-tubes <b>142</b><i>a </i>and <b>142</b><i>b </i>to rotate and/or translate along other unwanted axes of motion (e.g., the frame <b>100</b><i>a </i>may wobble), which may compromise the mechanical stability of the frame <b>100</b><i>a</i>. Thus, in some implementations, the nominal dimensions and tolerances of the opening <b>147</b> and the shaft of the fastener are particularly chosen to be sufficiently loose to ensure the feet <b>114</b> of the leg support assemblies <b>110</b><i>a </i>contact the ground <b>90</b> while still being sufficiently tight to limit unwanted rotational and/or translation motion between the X-tubes <b>142</b><i>a </i>and <b>142</b><i>b </i>and/or the sliders <b>120</b> or corners <b>130</b>. For example, the tolerance (or clearance) between the shaft of the fastener and the edge of the opening <b>147</b> may greater than or equal to about 0.010 inches and, more preferably, greater than or equal to about 0.015 inches.</p>
<p id="p-0212" num="0210">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b>A</figref>, the pin joint <b>145</b> may generally be located along the length of the respective X-tubes <b>142</b><i>a </i>and <b>142</b><i>b</i>. For example, the pin joint <b>145</b> may be positioned at an offset distance, z], from the first end <b>143</b><i>a </i>and an offset distance, z<b>2</b>, from the second end <b>143</b><i>b</i>. In some implementations, the offset distances z/ and z<b>2</b> may be equal, which causes the respective first and second ends <b>143</b><i>a </i>and <b>143</b><i>b </i>of the X-tubes <b>142</b><i>a </i>and <b>142</b><i>b </i>to follow the same circular path when the X-tubes <b>142</b><i>a </i>and <b>142</b><i>b </i>are rotated. This, in turn, causes the orientation of the leg support assemblies <b>110</b><i>a </i>to remain unchanged when the frame <b>100</b><i>a </i>is being folded and/or unfolded. For example, the leg tubes <b>112</b> of each leg support assembly <b>110</b><i>a </i>may remain vertically oriented for both folded and unfolded configurations.</p>
<p id="p-0213" num="0211">In other implementations, however, the offset distances z/ and z<b>2</b> may not be equal. For example, the offset distance z<b>2</b> may be larger than the offset distance z/causing the first end <b>143</b><i>a </i>of the X-tube <b>142</b><i>a </i>to follow a smaller circular path and the second <b>143</b><i>b </i>to follow larger circular path when the X-tube <b>142</b><i>a </i>is rotated. The respective first and second ends <b>143</b><i>a </i>and <b>143</b><i>b </i>of the X-tube <b>142</b><i>b </i>may similarly follow smaller and larger circular paths, respectively. This, in turn, may cause the leg support assemblies <b>110</b><i>a </i>and, in particular, the leg tubes <b>112</b> to flare outwards when the frame <b>100</b><i>a </i>is unfolded. In other words, the leg tubes <b>112</b> of the leg support assemblies <b>110</b><i>a </i>may be tilted due to the rotational motion of the X-tubes <b>142</b><i>a </i>and <b>142</b><i>b </i>in the X-frame assemblies <b>140</b><i>a </i>such that the top ends <b>113</b><i>a </i>constitute the vertices of a smaller horizontal cross-section (parallel to the ground) than the bottom ends <b>113</b><i>b </i>(i.e., the top ends <b>113</b><i>a </i>are positioned closer to one another than the bottom ends <b>113</b><i>b</i>). In this manner, the frame <b>100</b><i>a </i>may define an interior space <b>102</b> with a truncated pyramidal interior shape as described above, which may be beneficial in improving the mechanical stability of the frame <b>100</b><i>a </i>(e.g., the frame <b>100</b><i>a </i>is less likely to be tilted over). With reference again to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b>B</figref>, in some implementations the leg support assemblies <b>110</b><i>a </i>may be flared outwards such that respective longitudinal axes <b>111</b><i>a </i>associated with the leg tubes <b>110</b><i>a </i>are tilted at an angle, 0, relative to the ground <b>90</b>, wherein the angle ranges between 2 degrees and 10 degrees and, more preferably, between 5 degrees and 7 degrees.</p>
<p id="p-0214" num="0212">Turning now to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b>B</figref>, in some implementations the X-tubes <b>142</b><i>a </i>and <b>142</b><i>b </i>may also be bent in shape. For example, the first and second ends <b>143</b><i>a </i>and <b>143</b><i>b </i>of the X-tube <b>142</b><i>a </i>may be aligned along a first axis <b>141</b><i>a </i>while a central portion <b>144</b> of the X-tube <b>142</b><i>a </i>is aligned along a second axis <b>141</b><i>b </i>that is parallel to and offset from the axis <b>141</b><i>a</i>. The X-tube <b>142</b><i>b </i>may have a similar bent shape as the X-tube <b>142</b><i>a</i>. In some implementations, the offset between the first and second axes <b>141</b><i>a </i>and <b>141</b><i>b </i>may be chosen to provide sufficient clearance between the X-tubes <b>142</b><i>a </i>and <b>142</b><i>b </i>such that the respective first and second ends <b>143</b><i>a </i>and <b>143</b><i>b </i>of the X-tubes <b>142</b><i>a </i>and <b>142</b><i>b </i>lie on the same plane (e.g., the side face <b>106</b> of the interior space <b>102</b>) as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b>B</figref>. This, in turn, allows the portions of the corners <b>130</b> and the sliders <b>120</b> to also lie on the same plane with the first and second ends <b>143</b><i>a </i>and <b>143</b><i>b </i>of the X-tubes <b>142</b><i>a </i>and <b>142</b><i>b</i>. In some implementations, aligning the corners <b>130</b> and sliders <b>120</b> in this manner may allow the frame <b>100</b><i>a </i>to fold more compactly.</p>
<p id="p-0215" num="0213"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>3</b>C-<b>3</b>E</figref> show additional views of the leg support assemblies <b>110</b><i>a </i>in the frame <b>100</b><i>a</i>. As shown, the leg tube <b>112</b> may be a substantially elongated, hollow tube that defines that path along which the slider <b>120</b> travels when the frame <b>100</b><i>a </i>is being folded and/or unfolded. In some implementations, the leg tube <b>112</b> may be substantially straight such that the slider <b>120</b> follows a straight path along the longitudinal axis <b>111</b><i>a </i>(see <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>2</b>A-<b>2</b>C</figref>). However, it should be appreciated the leg tube <b>112</b> may also be curved in other implementations to define a correspondingly curved path for the slider <b>120</b> to follow. Examples of curved leg tubes <b>112</b> will be discussed in further detail below. In some implementations, the leg tube <b>112</b> may have a cross-section that remains constant along the length, L, of the leg tube <b>112</b>. In some implementations, the leg tube <b>112</b> may have various cross-sectional shapes including, but not limited to a circle, an oval, and an oblong shape. The leg tube <b>112</b> may also be formed from various materials including, but not limited to steel, aluminum, and carbon fiber.</p>
<p id="p-0216" num="0214">The slider <b>120</b> may include a base <b>121</b> that defines a through hole opening <b>122</b> shaped and/or dimensioned to surround the leg tube <b>112</b>, thus enabling the slider <b>120</b> to slidably move along the leg tube <b>112</b>. In some implementations, the shape of the opening <b>122</b> may conform with the cross-sectional shape of the leg tube <b>112</b>. The slider <b>120</b> may further include an extended portion <b>124</b> coupled to one side of the base <b>121</b> to couple the X-tube <b>142</b><i>a </i>of one X-frame assembly <b>140</b><i>a </i>to the slider <b>120</b> via a fastener inserted through an opening on the extended portion <b>124</b> aligned to the opening <b>147</b> of the X-tube <b>142</b><i>a </i>(see, for example, the exploded views of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>4</b>A and <b>4</b>B</figref>). The extended portion <b>124</b> may also include a recessed opening to receive the end of the X-tube <b>142</b><i>a </i>that is coupled to the slider <b>120</b>. The slider <b>120</b> may also include an extended portion <b>126</b> similar to the extended portion <b>124</b> that is disposed opposite from the extended portion <b>124</b> to couple the X-tube <b>142</b><i>b </i>of another X-frame assembly <b>140</b><i>a </i>to the slider <b>120</b> via another fastener inserted through an opening on the extended portion <b>126</b> aligned to the opening <b>147</b> of the X-tube <b>142</b><i>b. </i></p>
<p id="p-0217" num="0215">The extended portions <b>124</b> and <b>126</b> may generally be oriented at an angle relative to each other to align the respective X-tubes <b>142</b><i>a </i>and <b>142</b><i>b </i>from adjoining X-frame assemblies <b>140</b><i>a </i>along the desired geometry of the interior space <b>102</b>. For example, the extended portions <b>124</b> and <b>126</b> may be rotated relative to one another by an obtuse angle of approximately 120 degrees corresponding to the angles between adjoining sides of a hexagon. In some implementations, the extended portions <b>124</b> and <b>126</b> may lie on the same horizontal plane. In some implementations, the extended portions <b>124</b> and <b>126</b> may be offset vertically from one another if the respective X-tubes <b>142</b><i>a </i>and <b>142</b><i>b </i>coupled to the slider <b>120</b> are not identical. In some implementations, the sliders <b>120</b> of the leg support assemblies <b>110</b><i>a </i>may be identical with one another, thus reducing the number of unique parts for manufacture.</p>
<p id="p-0218" num="0216">The corner <b>130</b> may include a base <b>131</b> that defines an opening <b>132</b> to receive the top end <b>113</b><i>a </i>of the leg tube <b>112</b>.

In some implementations, an opening formed in the tab portion <b>138</b> to attach the snap-fit connector <b>139</b> to the corner <b>130</b> may also be used to securely couple the corner <b>130</b> to the leg tube <b>112</b> using the same fastener.</p>
<p id="p-0221" num="0219"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b>E</figref> shows a magnified view of the foot <b>114</b> of the leg support assembly <b>110</b><i>a</i>.

As shown, the foot <b>114</b> may define an opening <b>115</b> to receive the bottom end <b>113</b><i>b </i>of the leg tube <b>112</b>. In some implementations, the shape of the opening <b>115</b> may conform with the cross-sectional shape of the leg tube <b>112</b>.

<p id="p-0222" num="0220">In some implementations, the foot <b>114</b> may also include a looped or ringed structure that extends from the base of the foot <b>114</b> to provide another attachment point to couple the soft goods <b>300</b> to the frame <b>100</b><i>a</i>.

As described above, the latch mechanism <b>200</b><i>a </i>may lock the frame <b>100</b><i>a </i>in the unfolded configuration. In particular, the latch mechanism <b>200</b><i>a </i>may maintain the sliders <b>120</b> of the leg support assemblies <b>110</b><i>a </i>proximate to the corresponding corners <b>130</b> such that the X-frame assemblies <b>140</b><i>a </i>remain unfolded forming a shallow X-frame structure in the top portion <b>108</b> of the frame. Thus, the latch mechanism <b>200</b><i>a </i>may provide sufficient mechanical restraints to support the various forces and/or torques applied to one or more of the sliders <b>120</b> (e.g., the weight of the X-tubes <b>142</b><i>a </i>and <b>142</b><i>b </i>acting on the slider <b>120</b>).</p>

For example, the frame <b>100</b><i>a </i>may include latch mechanisms disposed on opposing sides of the frame <b>100</b><i>a </i>to ensure the frame <b>100</b><i>a</i>, when unfolded, maintains an even, unfolded shape (e.g., one side of the frame <b>100</b><i>a </i>does not sag downwards relative to another side). However, in other implementations, a single latch mechanism is sufficient to lock the frame <b>100</b><i>a </i>in the unfolded configuration while keeping the various leg support assemblies <b>110</b><i>a </i>and X-frame assemblies <b>140</b><i>a </i>unfolded evenly. For example, with reference again to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>2</b>A-<b>2</b>C</figref>, these figures show that the frame <b>100</b><i>a </i>includes a single latch mechanism <b>200</b><i>a </i>disposed, in part, on one leg support assembly <b>110</b><i>a </i>and one X-frame assembly <b>140</b><i>a</i>. In some implementations, the latch mechanism <b>200</b><i>a </i>may be configured to withstand a load greater than or equal to 10 lbs. before being disengaged or unlocked.</p>
<p id="p-0228" num="0226"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>6</b>A</figref> shows the latch mechanism <b>200</b><i>a </i>may include a latch member <b>210</b> (also referred to herein as a &#x201c;flex lock&#x201d;) with a top end <b>211</b><i>a </i>coupled to the corner <b>130</b> of one leg support assembly <b>110</b><i>a </i>and a latch boss <b>230</b> coupled to the X-tube <b>142</b><i>a </i>of one X-frame assembly <b>140</b><i>a</i>. The latch member <b>210</b> may include an opening <b>212</b> disposed at the first end <b>211</b><i>a </i>that aligns with the opening on the corner <b>130</b> used to couple to the X-tube <b>142</b><i>b</i>. In this manner, a single fastener may couple the latch member <b>210</b>, the corner <b>130</b>, and the X-tube <b>142</b><i>b </i>together and the corner <b>130</b> may remain unmodified. In other words, the latch member <b>210</b> may be coupled to any one of the corners <b>130</b> in the leg support assemblies <b>110</b><i>a </i>of the frame <b>100</b><i>a </i>provided the latch boss <b>230</b> is coupled to one of the X-tubes <b>142</b><i>a </i>and <b>142</b><i>b </i>adjoining the leg support assembly <b>110</b><i>a</i>. In some implementations, the latch member <b>210</b> may be coupled to the corner <b>130</b> via a pin joint connection or a rigid connection (e.g., in which the latch member <b>210</b> cannot be rotated relative to the corner <b>130</b>). The latch boss <b>230</b> may include an opening that is shaped and/or dimensioned to conform with the X-tube <b>142</b><i>a</i>, thus enabling the latch boss <b>230</b> is slid onto the X-tube <b>142</b><i>a </i>for assembly. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>6</b>B</figref> shows the latch boss <b>230</b> may then be coupled to the X-tube <b>142</b><i>a </i>using, for example, a fastener inserted through respective openings (not shown) on the latch boss <b>230</b> and the X-tube <b>142</b><i>a. </i></p>
<p id="p-0229" num="0227">With reference again to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>6</b>A</figref>, the latch member <b>210</b> may include a latch opening <b>214</b> disposed at a second end <b>211</b><i>b </i>of the latch member <b>210</b> located opposite from the first end <b>211</b><i>a</i>. The latch opening <b>214</b> may be shaped and/or dimensioned to receive the latch boss <b>230</b>. In other words, the latch opening <b>214</b> may function as a latch catch. In this manner, the latch member <b>210</b> may directly couple the corner <b>130</b> to the X-tube <b>142</b><i>b </i>by engaging with the latch boss <b>230</b>, thus holding the slider <b>120</b> in the top portion <b>108</b> of the frame <b>100</b><i>a </i>near the corner <b>130</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0230" num="0228">The latch member <b>210</b> may also include a tab <b>220</b> disposed at the second end <b>211</b><i>b</i>. Generally, the latch member <b>210</b> may be a mechanically compliant component that bends when the caregiver pulls on the tab <b>220</b> to disengage the latch member <b>210</b> from the latch boss <b>230</b>. The latch member <b>210</b> may also have sufficient mechanical rigidity such that a restoring force is generated when bent by the caregiver. When the caregiver releases the tab <b>220</b>, the restoring force may return the latch member <b>210</b> back to its original shape. In some implementations, the latch member <b>210</b> may be formed from a plastic material. The latch member <b>210</b> may further have a sufficient thickness and/or be reinforced with integral rib structures to provide the desired mechanical rigidity.</p>
<p id="p-0231" num="0229">In some implementations, the latch mechanism <b>200</b><i>a </i>may be a double-action latch mechanism (e.g., the caregiver needs to perform two operations to unlock the latch mechanism). For example, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>6</b>C</figref> shows the latch opening <b>214</b> of the latch member <b>210</b> may include a tab <b>216</b> disposed within the latch opening <b>214</b>. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>6</b>D</figref> shows the latch boss <b>230</b> may include an undercut portion <b>232</b> that forms a notch or a slot between the X-tube <b>142</b><i>a </i>and an end portion <b>236</b>. Thus, when the latch member <b>210</b> is coupled to the latch boss <b>230</b>, the tab <b>216</b> of the latch member <b>210</b> is disposed within the undercut portion <b>232</b> and retained by the end portion <b>236</b> of the latch boss <b>230</b>. In some implementations, the tab <b>216</b> may further define a slot <b>218</b> as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>6</b>C</figref>, and the latch boss <b>230</b> may further include a rib <b>234</b> partially disposed within the undercut portion <b>232</b> as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>6</b>D</figref>, that together facilitate alignment of the tab <b>216</b> to the undercut portion <b>232</b> to ensure the latch member <b>210</b> is properly engaged with the latch boss <b>230</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0232" num="0230">To setup the frame <b>100</b><i>a </i>and, by extension the playard <b>1000</b><i>a</i>, the caregiver may initially move the slider <b>120</b> of one leg support assembly <b>110</b><i>a </i>towards the corresponding corner <b>130</b> to partially unfold the frame <b>100</b><i>a</i>. As the frame <b>100</b><i>a </i>is being unfolded, the latch boss <b>230</b> disposed on the X-tube <b>142</b><i>a </i>is displaced towards the latch member <b>210</b> coupled to the corner <b>130</b>. Once the latch boss <b>230</b> reaches the latch member <b>210</b> and, in particular, the tab <b>216</b>, further movement of the slider <b>120</b> along the leg tube <b>112</b> results in contact between the latch boss <b>230</b> and the tab <b>216</b>, which causes the latch member <b>210</b> to be deflected outwards. In some implementations, the latch member <b>210</b> may include a lead-in feature on the tab <b>216</b> (not shown), such as a sloped or a ramped wall. The lead-in feature may allow the latch member <b>210</b> to be deflected more effectively as the latch boss <b>230</b> slides against the latch member <b>210</b> by orienting the contact force between the latch member <b>210</b> and the latch boss <b>230</b> along a direction that increases the magnitude of the torque applied to bend the latch member <b>210</b> (note that the pivot point of the latch member <b>210</b> is located at the mounting opening <b>212</b> as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>6</b>A</figref>).</p>
<p id="p-0233" num="0231">As the latch member <b>210</b> is deflected with further movement of the slider <b>120</b> along the leg tube <b>112</b>, an internal restoring force is generated within the latch member <b>210</b>, which is applied against the latch boss <b>230</b>. As the caregiver continues to move the slider <b>120</b> towards the corner <b>130</b>, the latch member <b>210</b> is deflected further outwards resulting in a higher magnitude restoring force being applied against the latch boss <b>230</b>. When the slider <b>120</b> is moved sufficiently close to the corner <b>130</b>, the latch boss <b>230</b> passes through the latch opening <b>214</b> and the restoring force causes the latch member <b>210</b> to snap back to its original position such that the latch boss <b>230</b> protrudes through the latch opening <b>214</b>. Once the caregiver releases the slider <b>120</b>, the slider <b>120</b> may move slightly downwards along the leg tube <b>112</b> due to gravity, causing the undercut portion <b>232</b> of the latch boss <b>230</b> to rest onto the tab <b>216</b> of the latch member <b>210</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0234" num="0232"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>6</b>E</figref> illustrates how a caregiver may transition the frame <b>100</b><i>a </i>and the playard <b>1000</b><i>a </i>to a folded configuration from the unfolded configuration by disengaging the double-action latch mechanism <b>200</b><i>a</i>. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>6</b>E</figref>, the caregiver may first squeeze the X-tubes <b>142</b><i>a </i>and <b>142</b><i>b </i>(as shown by the upward and downward arrows in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>6</b>E</figref>), which causes the slider <b>120</b> to move upwards along the leg tube <b>112</b>, thus disengaging the tab <b>216</b> of the latch member <b>210</b> from the undercut portion <b>232</b> of the latch boss <b>230</b>. While the caregiver is squeezing the X-tubes <b>142</b><i>a </i>and <b>142</b><i>b </i>together with one hand, the caregiver may then pull on the tab <b>220</b> of the latch member <b>210</b> with another hand to release the latch boss <b>230</b> from the latch opening <b>214</b> (as shown by the curved arrow in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>6</b>E</figref>). The &#x201c;double-action&#x201d; of the latch mechanism <b>200</b><i>a </i>is thus &#x201c;squeeze-and-pull.&#x201d; While holding the latch member <b>210</b>, the caregiver may then release the X-tubes <b>142</b><i>a </i>and <b>142</b><i>b </i>and the slider <b>120</b> may then fall downwards along the leg tube <b>112</b> due, in part, to the weight of the X-frame assemblies <b>140</b><i>a</i>. The caregiver may then move the slider <b>120</b> downwards towards the foot <b>114</b> of the leg support assembly <b>110</b><i>a</i>, thus folding the playard <b>1000</b><i>a. </i></p>
<p id="p-0235" num="0233">With reference again to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>6</b>D</figref>, in some implementations of the double-action latch mechanism <b>200</b><i>a</i>, the undercut portion <b>232</b> and the end portion <b>236</b> of the latch boss <b>230</b> and the tab <b>216</b> of the latch member <b>210</b> may be shaped and/or dimensioned such that latch member <b>210</b> cannot be pulled off the latch boss <b>230</b> without applying an appreciably large force (e.g., a force greater than 20 lbs). For example, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>7</b>A</figref> shows a force test being applied to the double-action latch mechanism <b>200</b><i>a</i>, which shows the latch member <b>210</b> remains engaged to the latch boss <b>230</b> when a force greater than 24 lbs is applied to the tab <b>220</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0236" num="0234">It should be appreciated that, in other implementations, the playard <b>1000</b><i>a </i>and, in particular, the frame <b>100</b><i>a </i>may include other types of latching mechanisms.

<p id="p-0237" num="0235">Specifically, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>8</b>A</figref> shows the playard <b>1000</b><i>a </i>with the soft goods <b>300</b> installed onto the frame <b>100</b><i>a</i>, where the soft goods <b>300</b> covers the corners <b>130</b> of the leg support assemblies <b>110</b><i>a </i>and partially covers the X-frame assemblies <b>140</b><i>a</i>. In this manner, a portion of the single-action latch mechanism <b>200</b><i>b </i>is left exposed to provide access to the caregiver (see, for example, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>8</b>B</figref>). As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>8</b>C and <b>8</b>D</figref>, the single-action latch mechanism <b>200</b><i>b </i>may also include a latch member <b>210</b> that is coupled at one end to the corner <b>130</b> via a fastener inserted through an opening <b>212</b> on the latch member <b>210</b>. The latch member <b>210</b> may once again include a latch opening <b>214</b> to receive a latch boss <b>230</b>.

<p id="p-0238" num="0236">The single-action latch mechanism <b>200</b><i>b </i>may be locked in a similar manner as the double-action latch mechanism <b>200</b><i>a</i>.

The spring-bias force applied to the latch <b>270</b> may cause the latch <b>270</b> to press against the exterior surfaces of the leg tube <b>112</b> as the slider <b>120</b> is moved towards the foot <b>114</b> and/or the surfaces of the slider <b>120</b> once the X-tube <b>142</b><i>b </i>is sufficiently rotated as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>14</b>D</figref>. In some implementations, the end of the latch <b>270</b> may be shaped (e.g., curved or contoured) to allow the X-tube <b>142</b><i>b </i>to rotate smoothly when pressing against the leg tube <b>112</b> and/or the slider <b>120</b> as the frame <b>100</b><i>a </i>is being folded and/or unfolded.</p>
<p id="p-0272" num="0270"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>15</b>A-<b>15</b>D</figref> show yet another exemplary latch mechanism <b>200</b><i>i </i>mounted onto the frame <b>100</b><i>a </i>of the playard <b>1000</b><i>a</i>. Specifically, the latch mechanism <b>200</b><i>i </i>may be mounted to one end of the X-tube <b>142</b><i>b </i>(or <b>142</b><i>a</i>) of one X-frame assembly <b>140</b><i>a </i>to engage the slider <b>120</b> of one leg support assembly <b>110</b><i>a</i>. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>15</b>A</figref> once again shows the frame <b>100</b><i>a </i>may only include a single latch mechanism <b>200</b><i>i </i>to support the frame <b>100</b><i>a </i>in the unfolded configuration. The latch mechanism <b>200</b><i>i </i>may be shaped and/or dimensioned such that the latch mechanism <b>200</b><i>i </i>fits within the recessed opening of the extended section <b>126</b> (or <b>124</b>) of the slider <b>120</b> together with the second end <b>143</b><i>b </i>of the X-tube <b>142</b><i>b</i>. In this manner, the latch mechanism <b>200</b><i>i </i>may not protrude outwards from the frame <b>100</b><i>a </i>even when the frame <b>100</b><i>a </i>is folded (see <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>15</b>B</figref>), thus preserving the compact shape of the folded frame <b>100</b><i>a. </i></p>
<p id="p-0273" num="0271"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>15</b>C</figref> shows the latch mechanism <b>200</b><i>i </i>may include a latch base <b>280</b> coupled to the second end <b>143</b><i>b </i>of the X-tube <b>142</b><i>b </i>and rotatably coupled to the slider <b>120</b>. In some implementations, a single fastener may couple the slider <b>120</b>, the latch base <b>280</b>, and the X-tube <b>142</b><i>b </i>together. As shown, the latch base <b>280</b> may include a latch member <b>284</b> that extends from the latch base <b>280</b>. The latch member <b>284</b> may be a mechanically compliant component that is deformable and may have sufficient mechanical rigidity to generate a restoring force when deformed.</p>
<p id="p-0274" num="0272">In some implementations, the latch base <b>280</b> may have a cylindrical shape and the latch member <b>284</b> may extend from the periphery of the latch base <b>280</b>. The latch member <b>284</b> may have a curved and/or contoured shape as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>15</b>C and <b>15</b>D</figref>. The latch member <b>284</b> may include an integrally formed latch catch <b>281</b> that is shaped to engage a latch opening <b>283</b> formed on a bottom surface <b>127</b> of the slider <b>120</b>. The latch member <b>284</b> may further include a tab <b>282</b> disposed at the end of the latch member <b>284</b>, which may be pulled to bend the latch member <b>282</b>, thus releasing the latch catch <b>281</b> from the latch opening <b>283</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0275" num="0273"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>15</b>D</figref> shows the latch member <b>284</b> may be disposed between the sliders <b>120</b> from adjacent leg support assemblies <b>110</b><i>a </i>when the frame <b>100</b><i>a </i>is unfolded. When unfolding the frame <b>100</b><i>a</i>, the latch body <b>280</b> together with the latch member <b>284</b> may rotate with the X-tube <b>142</b><i>b </i>about the pin joint <b>146</b><i>c </i>relative to the slider <b>120</b> as the slider <b>120</b> moves up along the leg tube <b>112</b> towards the corner <b>130</b>. As the latch body <b>280</b> rotates, the latch member <b>284</b> and, in particular, the latch catch <b>281</b>, may initially contact the exterior portions of the slider <b>120</b>, thus bending and/or deflecting the latch member <b>284</b>. In some implementations, the latch catch <b>281</b> may include a lead-in feature to facilitate the deflection of the latch member <b>284</b> as the frame <b>100</b><i>a </i>is unfolded.</p>
<p id="p-0276" num="0274">Once the slider <b>120</b> is positioned sufficiently close to the corner <b>130</b> and/or the X-tube <b>142</b><i>b </i>is sufficiently rotated such that the latch catch <b>281</b> aligns with the latch opening <b>283</b>, the restoring force generated by the deflection of the latch member <b>284</b> may insert the latch catch <b>281</b> into the latch opening <b>283</b>. The latch catch <b>281</b> and the latch opening <b>283</b> may thus prevent further rotation of the X-tube <b>142</b><i>b </i>relative to the slider <b>120</b> and, hence, further movement of the slider <b>120</b> along the leg tube <b>112</b> to hold the frame <b>100</b><i>a </i>in the unfolded configuration.</p>
<p id="p-0277" num="0275">To unlock the latch mechanism <b>200</b><i>i</i>, the caregiver may pull on the tab <b>282</b> with sufficient force to release the latch catch <b>281</b> from the latch opening <b>283</b>. While holding the tab <b>282</b>, the slider <b>120</b> may then move downwards along the leg tube <b>112</b> towards the foot <b>114</b>, which causes the X-tube <b>142</b><i>b </i>and the latch body <b>280</b> to rotate relative to the slider <b>120</b>. Once the latch catch <b>281</b> is no longer aligned with the latch opening <b>283</b>, the caregiver may release the tab <b>282</b> and proceed with folding the frame <b>100</b><i>a. </i></p>
<p id="p-0278" num="0276">As described above, the frame <b>100</b><i>a </i>may generally include at least one latch mechanism to maintain the frame <b>100</b><i>a </i>and, by extension, the playard <b>1000</b><i>a </i>in the unfolded configuration. In some implementations, the frame <b>100</b><i>a </i>may include a single latch mechanism (e.g., one of the latch mechanisms <b>200</b><i>a</i>-<b>200</b><i>i</i>) to lock the unfolded frame <b>100</b><i>a</i>, which may simplify the frame <b>100</b><i>a </i>by reducing the number of parts for manufacture. However, in other implementations, the frame <b>100</b><i>a </i>may include multiple latching mechanisms to ensure the various components of the frame <b>100</b><i>a </i>are kept evenly unfolded. Thus, it should be appreciated that in other implementations, the frame <b>100</b><i>a </i>may include combinations of one or more of the latch mechanisms <b>200</b><i>a</i>-<b>200</b><i>i </i>described above.</p>
<p id="p-0279" num="0277"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>16</b>A and <b>16</b>B</figref> show one example of a frame <b>100</b><i>a </i>that includes the latch mechanism <b>200</b><i>g </i>coupled to one X-frame assembly <b>140</b><i>a </i>and the latch mechanism <b>200</b><i>h </i>coupled to the X-tube of another X-frame assembly <b>140</b><i>a </i>and the slider <b>120</b> of one leg support assembly <b>110</b><i>a</i>. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>16</b>A</figref> shows the latch mechanisms <b>200</b><i>g </i>and <b>200</b><i>i </i>being used to maintain the frame <b>100</b><i>a </i>in the unfolded configuration. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>16</b>B</figref> shows the latch mechanisms <b>200</b><i>g </i>and <b>200</b><i>i </i>do not appreciably extend outwards from the frame <b>100</b><i>a </i>when the frame <b>100</b><i>a </i>is in the folded configuration.</p>
<p id="p-0280" num="0278">As described above, the foldable playard may generally include a frame that outlines an interior space. The frame may include multiple leg support assemblies and X-frame assemblies that together define and/or align with the outer boundaries of the interior space. For example, the playard <b>1000</b><i>a </i>includes a frame <b>100</b><i>a </i>defining an interior space <b>102</b> with a horizontal cross-section shaped as a hexagon. It should be appreciated that the various implementations of the foldable playard described herein may define interior spaces having other geometries based, in part, on the number of leg support assemblies and/or the X-frame assemblies used for construction.</p>
<p id="p-0281" num="0279">For example, the playard may outline an interior space with a square horizontal cross-section. The frame of the playard may include four identical leg support assemblies, which may be connected together using four identical X-frame assemblies where each X-frame assembly forms a single (or double) X-frame structure. As before, each X-frame assembly may couple adjacent leg support assemblies together.</p>
<p id="p-0282" num="0280">In another example, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>17</b>A-<b>17</b>D</figref> show an exemplary playard <b>1000</b><i>b </i>with a frame <b>100</b><i>b </i>that outlines an interior space <b>102</b> with a horizontal cross-section shaped as a rectangle. The frame <b>100</b><i>a </i>may include multiple leg support assemblies <b>110</b><i>b </i>defining and/or aligning with the respective side edges <b>104</b> of the interior space <b>102</b> when the frame <b>100</b><i>b </i>is unfolded to support the playard <b>1000</b><i>b </i>on the ground <b>90</b> (see, for example, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>18</b>A</figref>). The frame <b>100</b><i>a </i>may include a pair of X-frame assemblies <b>140</b><i>a </i>disposed on the smaller side faces <b>106</b> of the interior space <b>102</b> to couple together adjacent leg support assemblies <b>110</b><i>b </i>located on the shorter sides of the rectangular horizontal cross-section of the interior space <b>102</b>. The frame <b>100</b> may further include a pair of X-frame assemblies <b>140</b><i>b </i>disposed on the larger side faces <b>106</b> of the interior space <b>102</b> to couple together adjacent leg support assemblies <b>110</b><i>b </i>located on the longer sides of the rectangular horizontal cross-section of the interior space <b>102</b>. Thus, each leg support assembly <b>110</b><i>b </i>may couple to one X-frame assembly <b>140</b><i>a </i>and one X-frame assembly <b>140</b><i>b. </i></p>
<p id="p-0283" num="0281">To form the rectangular-shaped interior space <b>102</b>, each X-frame assembly <b>140</b><i>a </i>may form a single X-frame structure, as described above, and each X-frame assembly <b>140</b><i>b </i>may form a double X-frame structure (i.e., two pairs of crossing X-tubes where each pair of X-tubes couples to one leg support assembly). The combination of the single and double X-frame structures allows the frame <b>100</b><i>b </i>to define an interior space <b>102</b> where the sides of the horizontal cross-section have different dimensions while enabling the X-frame assemblies <b>140</b><i>a </i>and <b>140</b><i>b </i>to couple to the same components of the leg support assembly <b>110</b><i>b </i>(e.g., the same slider <b>120</b> and corner <b>130</b>) so that the leg support assemblies <b>110</b><i>b</i>, the X-frame assemblies <b>140</b><i>a</i>, and the X-frame assemblies <b>140</b><i>b </i>may fold and/or unfold together (see <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>17</b>C</figref>). Furthermore, the double X-frame structure of the X-frame assembly <b>140</b><i>b </i>may also enable the leg support assemblies <b>110</b><i>b </i>and, in particular, the length of the leg tube <b>112</b> to be shorter compared to a single X-frame structure that spans the same length as the X-frame assembly <b>140</b><i>b </i>when deployed. Thus, the frame <b>100</b><i>b </i>may be more compact, particularly, when folded.</p>
<p id="p-0284" num="0282">Similar to the frame <b>100</b><i>a</i>, the frame <b>100</b><i>b </i>may be unfolded with the feet <b>114</b> of the leg support assemblies <b>110</b><i>b </i>remaining in contact with the ground <b>90</b>. Additionally, the leg tubes <b>112</b> may remain vertically upright or nearly vertically upright (e.g., leg tubes <b>112</b> may intentionally be tilted when the frame <b>100</b><i>b </i>is unfolded to improve stability) while the frame <b>100</b><i>b </i>is being folded and/or unfolded to make the process of setting up and/or tearing down the playard <b>1000</b><i>b </i>easier for the caregiver (see <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>17</b>D</figref>).</p>
<p id="p-0285" num="0283">Additionally, the X-frame assemblies <b>140</b><i>a </i>and <b>140</b><i>b </i>in the frame <b>100</b><i>b </i>may be disposed in the top portion <b>108</b> of the frame <b>100</b><i>a </i>to form a top perimeter structure along the interior space <b>102</b> (see <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>18</b>A</figref>). As before, this may enable the respective X-tubes of the X-frame assemblies <b>140</b><i>a </i>and <b>140</b><i>b </i>to function as top rails to provide mechanical stability and rigidity to the frame <b>100</b><i>b</i>. In some implementations, the frame <b>100</b><i>b </i>may not include a separate compliant or rigid top rail and/or a bottom support structure.</p>
<p id="p-0286" num="0284">In some implementations, the frame <b>100</b><i>b </i>with only X-frame assemblies <b>140</b><i>a </i>and <b>140</b><i>b </i>coupling the leg support assemblies <b>110</b><i>b </i>together may provide sufficient mechanical rigidity, stability, and/or strength to satisfy various consumer safety standards (e.g., ASTM F406-19). For example, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>22</b></figref> shows the playard <b>1000</b><i>b </i>subjected to a stability test. Similar to the playard <b>1000</b><i>a</i>, the playard <b>1000</b><i>b </i>was demonstrated to remain sufficiently stable (i.e., at least three feet <b>114</b> remained in contact with the underlying platform) when the playard <b>1000</b><i>b </i>was tilted more than 10 degrees.</p>
<p id="p-0287" num="0285"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>17</b>A and <b>17</b>B</figref> further show the playard <b>1000</b><i>b </i>may include soft goods <b>300</b> coupled to the frame <b>100</b><i>b </i>and forming a partially enclosed space <b>301</b> disposed within the interior space <b>102</b> to contain the child <b>50</b>. As before, the soft goods <b>300</b> may be readily folded together with the frame <b>100</b><i>b </i>as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>17</b>C</figref>. The soft goods <b>300</b> may include a floor portion <b>306</b> that rests on the ground <b>90</b> supporting the playard <b>1000</b><i>b </i>and side portions <b>304</b> that together define and surround the partially enclosed space <b>301</b>. The floor portion <b>306</b> may include a removable mat to provide padding on the ground <b>90</b>. The side portions <b>304</b> may be formed from transparent and/or see-through materials to allow the caregiver to monitor their child <b>50</b> when the child <b>50</b> is placed into the partially enclosed space <b>301</b>. The soft goods <b>300</b> may include tethers and/or straps to attach the floor portion <b>306</b> to the bottom portions of the leg support assemblies <b>110</b><i>b. </i></p>
<p id="p-0288" num="0286">The soft goods <b>300</b> may further include a top portion <b>302</b>, formed from an opaque textile material, to attach the soft goods <b>300</b> to the top portions of the leg support assemblies <b>110</b><i>b </i>as well as cover the top portion of the frame <b>100</b><i>b</i>. In particular, the soft goods <b>300</b> in the playard <b>1000</b><i>b </i>may fully cover one or more of the X-frame assemblies <b>140</b><i>a </i>and <b>140</b><i>b</i>, the corners <b>130</b> of the leg support assemblies <b>110</b><i>b</i>, and/or the sliders <b>120</b> of the leg support assemblies <b>110</b><i>b</i>. In some implementations, the soft goods <b>300</b> may fully cover the X-frame assemblies <b>140</b><i>a </i>and <b>140</b><i>b </i>as well as the sliders <b>120</b> and the corners <b>130</b> of the leg support assemblies <b>110</b><i>b </i>such that only the leg tubes <b>112</b> and/or the feet <b>114</b> are observable as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>17</b>A and <b>17</b>B</figref>. As before, positioning the X-frame assemblies <b>140</b><i>a </i>and <b>140</b><i>b </i>in the top portion <b>108</b> of the frame <b>100</b><i>b </i>when the frame <b>100</b><i>b </i>is unfolded may also increase the visibility of the child <b>50</b> due to the larger visually unobstructed portions of the side faces <b>106</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0289" num="0287">As described above, conventional playards and especially, indoor playards, typically have to compromise between ease of use, visibility of the child, and/or the appearance of the playard (see, for example, playard <b>10</b><i>c</i>). In comparison, the playard <b>1000</b><i>b </i>may simultaneously improve ease of use, visibility of the child, and the overall appearance. First, the playard <b>1000</b><i>b </i>includes X-frame assemblies <b>140</b><i>a </i>and <b>140</b><i>b </i>that allow the frame <b>100</b><i>b </i>to be folded and/or unfolded in one step. For instance, the caregiver may move one slider <b>120</b> of one leg support assembly <b>110</b><i>b </i>to fold and/or unfold the frame <b>100</b><i>b</i>. Second, the X-frame assemblies <b>140</b><i>a </i>and <b>140</b><i>b </i>are positioned in the top portion <b>108</b> of the frame <b>100</b><i>b </i>when the playard <b>1000</b><i>b </i>is deployed, which allows for greater visibility of the child in the partially enclosed space <b>301</b> through the sides of the frame <b>100</b><i>b</i>. Third, aesthetically undesirable components, such as the X-tubes, the sliders <b>120</b>, the corners <b>130</b>, may be readily hidden by the top portion <b>302</b> of the soft goods <b>300</b> to provide a cleaner, more aesthetically desirable appearance.</p>
<p id="p-0290" num="0288"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>18</b>A</figref> shows the frame <b>100</b><i>b </i>without the soft goods <b>300</b> attached in the unfolded configuration. As shown, each leg support assembly <b>110</b><i>b </i>may be similar to leg support assemblies <b>110</b><i>a </i>used in the frame <b>100</b><i>a</i>. For instance, the leg support assembly <b>110</b><i>b </i>includes a leg tube <b>112</b> with a top end <b>113</b><i>a </i>and a bottom end <b>113</b><i>b</i>, a corner <b>130</b> coupled to the top end <b>113</b><i>a</i>, a foot <b>114</b> coupled to the bottom end <b>113</b><i>b</i>, and a slider <b>120</b> that is slidably coupled to be leg tube <b>112</b> and disposed between the foot <b>114</b> and the corner <b>130</b>. The top end <b>113</b><i>a </i>of the leg tube <b>112</b> and/or the corner <b>130</b> may align with a top vertex <b>105</b> of the interior space <b>102</b>. The bottom end <b>113</b><i>b </i>of the leg tube <b>112</b> and/or the foot <b>114</b> may align with a bottom vertex <b>107</b> of the interior space <b>102</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0291" num="0289"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>18</b>B</figref> further shows the leg tubes <b>112</b> may have a circular cross-sectional shape. The leg tubes <b>112</b> may also remain vertical or nearly vertical for both the folded and unfolded configurations.

The slider <b>120</b> may once again include a base <b>121</b> that defines a through hole opening <b>122</b> that surrounds the leg tube <b>112</b>. The slider <b>120</b> may include extended portions <b>124</b> and <b>126</b> disposed on opposing sides of the base <b>121</b> to couple respective X-tubes (e.g., X-tubes <b>142</b><i>a </i>and <b>142</b><i>d </i>in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>18</b>B</figref>) of the X-frame assemblies <b>140</b><i>a </i>and <b>140</b><i>b </i>to the slider <b>120</b>.

Once again, the corner <b>130</b> may include extended portions <b>134</b> and <b>136</b> disposed on opposing sides of the base <b>131</b> to couple respective X-tubes (e.g., X-tubes <b>142</b><i>b </i>and <b>142</b><i>c </i>in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>18</b>D</figref>) of the X-frame assemblies <b>140</b><i>a </i>and <b>140</b><i>b </i>to the corner <b>130</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0292" num="0290"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>19</b>A</figref> shows the frame <b>100</b><i>b </i>in the folded configuration. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>19</b>B</figref> shows the slider <b>120</b> may be disposed proximate to the foot <b>114</b> when the frame <b>100</b><i>b </i>is folded.

Furthermore, the pin joints that connect the respective X-tubes of the X-frame assemblies <b>140</b><i>a </i>and <b>140</b><i>b </i>to the slider <b>120</b> or the corner <b>130</b> may be located along the same horizontal plane. Thus, the respective ends of the X-tubes of the X-frame assemblies <b>140</b><i>a </i>and <b>140</b><i>b </i>that couple to the leg support assembly <b>110</b><i>b </i>may travel the same distance along the leg tube <b>112</b> to fold and/or unfold both the X-frame assemblies <b>140</b><i>a </i>and <b>140</b><i>b</i>. This enables the slider <b>120</b> and the corner <b>130</b> to be thinner in size and, in turn, reduces the overall length, L, of the leg tube <b>112</b> such that the leg tube <b>112</b> only provides sufficient overlap to couple the foot <b>114</b> and the corner <b>130</b> to the leg tube <b>112</b> and sufficient clearance for the slider <b>120</b> to move a sufficient distance to fold and/or unfold the X-frame assemblies <b>140</b><i>a </i>and <b>140</b><i>b</i>. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>18</b>B and <b>19</b>B</figref>, the slider <b>120</b> may be disposed proximate to the corner <b>130</b> when the frame <b>100</b><i>b </i>is in the unfolded configuration and proximate to the foot <b>114</b> when the frame <b>100</b><i>b </i>is in the folded configuration.</p>

<p id="p-0294" num="0292"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>20</b>C</figref> shows the X-frame assembly <b>140</b><i>b </i>may include two pairs of X-tubes, i.e., the X-tubes <b>142</b><i>c </i>and <b>142</b><i>d </i>as well as the X-tubes <b>142</b><i>e </i>and <b>142</b><i>f</i>. The X-tubes <b>142</b><i>c </i>and <b>142</b><i>d </i>may be rotatably coupled to each other via a pin joint <b>145</b> similar to the X-tubes <b>142</b><i>a </i>and <b>142</b><i>b </i>in the X-frame assembly <b>140</b><i>a</i>.

<p id="p-0295" num="0293">In some implementations, the shape and/or dimensions of the X-tubes <b>142</b><i>c</i>-<b>142</b><i>f </i>may be substantially identical or identical with each other.

Similarly, the pin joint <b>145</b> coupling the X-tubes <b>142</b><i>e </i>and <b>142</b><i>f </i>together may also be positioned closer to the pin joints <b>146</b><i>h </i>and <b>146</b><i>f </i>than the pin joints <b>146</b><i>i </i>and <b>146</b><i>j</i>. The position of the pin joints <b>145</b> along the X-tubes <b>142</b><i>c</i>-<b>142</b><i>f </i>may be tailored to ensure the respective ends of the X-tubes <b>142</b><i>c</i>-<b>142</b><i>f </i>align with the ends of the X-tubes <b>142</b><i>a </i>and <b>142</b><i>b </i>when coupled to the same corner <b>130</b> or slider <b>120</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0297" num="0295">For example, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>20</b>D</figref> shows the pin joint <b>146</b><i>d </i>coupling the X-tube <b>142</b><i>b </i>to the corner <b>130</b> and the pin joint <b>146</b><i>e </i>coupling the X-tube <b>142</b><i>c </i>to the same corner <b>130</b> lie on the same horizontal plane <b>150</b><i>a</i>. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>20</b>E</figref> similarly shows the pin joint <b>146</b><i>b </i>coupling the X-tube <b>142</b><i>a </i>to the slider <b>120</b> and the pin joint <b>146</b><i>g </i>coupling the X-tube <b>142</b><i>d </i>to the same slider <b>120</b> may also lie on the same horizontal plane <b>150</b><i>b</i>.

<p id="p-0306" num="0304">The shape and/or dimensions of the respective X-tubes in the X-frame assemblies <b>140</b><i>a </i>and <b>140</b><i>b </i>and/or the location of the pin joints that rotatably couple each X-tube to another X-tube, the slider <b>120</b>, and/or the corner <b>130</b> may be tailored based, in part, on the desired dimensions of the interior space <b>102</b> similar to the frame <b>100</b><i>b</i>. Additionally, in some implementations, the X-tubes of the X-frame assemblies <b>140</b><i>a </i>and <b>140</b><i>b </i>may be arranged such that the pin joints that couple the X-tubes to the same slider <b>120</b> or corner <b>130</b> of the leg support assembly <b>110</b><i>c </i>are aligned along the same horizontal plane.</p>
<p id="p-0307" num="0305">The X-frame assemblies <b>140</b><i>a </i>and <b>140</b><i>b </i>may once again be disposed within a top portion <b>108</b> of the frame <b>100</b><i>c </i>and/or the interior space <b>102</b>. This enables the X-frame assemblies <b>140</b><i>a </i>and <b>140</b><i>b </i>to function as top rails to mechanically reinforce the frame <b>100</b><i>c </i>while also eliminating other support structures, such as a separate top rail and/or a bottom support structure.

<p id="p-0308" num="0306">In some implementations, the soft goods <b>300</b> in the playard <b>1000</b><i>c </i>may be divided into separate components, in part, to better conform with the geometry of the interior space <b>102</b>.

To better conform with the shape of the interior space <b>102</b>, the side portions <b>306</b> may be mounted along an interior side of the leg tube <b>112</b> to reduce or, in some instances, prevent gaps from forming between the side portions <b>306</b> and the leg support assemblies <b>110</b><i>c </i>(see, for example, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>26</b>A</figref>) when the playard <b>1000</b><i>c </i>is unfolded. Said in another way, the side portions <b>306</b> of the soft goods <b>300</b> may be attached to the leg support assemblies <b>110</b><i>c </i>to provide a seamless appearance with the leg tubes <b>112</b>, the feet <b>114</b>, and/or the wheel assemblies <b>151</b> being exposed along the exterior portion of the playard <b>1000</b><i>c </i>as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>23</b>A-<b>23</b>C</figref>. Once the side portions <b>306</b> and the floor portion <b>304</b> of the soft goods <b>300</b> are installed, the top portion <b>302</b> may then be attached to the side portions <b>306</b> using, for example, a zipper connection (not shown), and subsequently coupled to the frame <b>100</b><i>c </i>to complete assembly.</p>
<p id="p-0309" num="0307">This may be accomplished, in part, by incorporating a stiffener <b>330</b> into the side portions <b>306</b> of the soft goods <b>300</b>, which may then the routed through a channel <b>171</b> formed along the leg tube <b>112</b>. The stiffener <b>330</b> may be a compliant component, such as an extruded plastic rod that is inserted through a pocket formed along the respective corners of the side portions <b>306</b> located near the side edges <b>104</b> of the interior space <b>102</b>. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>26</b>B</figref> shows the leg tube <b>112</b> may have an oblong cross-sectional shape with a curved side <b>172</b> that forms a recess along the interior side of the leg tube <b>112</b> facing the interior space <b>102</b>. The channel <b>171</b> may be formed on the curved side <b>172</b> and may span a portion of or, in some instances, the entire length of the leg tube <b>112</b>. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>26</b>B</figref>, the stiffener <b>330</b> may be inserted through the channel <b>171</b>, thus holding the side portions <b>306</b> of the soft goods <b>300</b> against the leg tube <b>112</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0310" num="0308">The slider <b>120</b> in the leg support assembly <b>110</b><i>c </i>may still be allowed to move along the leg tube <b>112</b> even with the side portions <b>306</b> of the soft goods <b>300</b> installed onto the leg tube <b>112</b>. For example, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>26</b>B</figref> shows the slider <b>120</b> may include a base <b>121</b> that defines a through hole opening <b>122</b> that only partially surrounds the leg tube <b>112</b> to guide the movement of the slider <b>120</b> along the leg tube <b>112</b>. As shown, a slotted opening <b>128</b> may be formed along an interior side of the base <b>121</b> to allow the side portions <b>306</b> attached to the leg tube <b>112</b> to pass through the base <b>121</b> of the slider <b>120</b>. In this manner, the slider <b>120</b> may move along the leg tube <b>112</b> unimpeded by the side portions <b>306</b> when the playard <b>1000</b><i>c </i>is folded and/or unfolded.</p>

The corner <b>130</b> may further include a tab <b>138</b> that extends downwards along the leg tube <b>112</b> and outwards from the frame <b>100</b><i>c </i>to form an overhang portion.

<p id="p-0313" num="0311">The corner <b>130</b> may be shaped in this manner to provide a hook structure for the top portion <b>302</b> of the soft goods <b>300</b> to wrap around, thus ensuring the corners <b>130</b> and the X-frame assemblies <b>140</b><i>a </i>and <b>140</b><i>b </i>are covered. In some implementations, the top portion <b>302</b> of the soft goods <b>300</b> may further include a pocket <b>331</b> to aid the caregiver in wrapping the soft goods <b>300</b> around the corners <b>130</b>. Additionally, the soft goods <b>130</b> may primarily contact only the exterior surfaces of the corner <b>130</b>, which may allow the corners of the playard <b>1000</b><i>c </i>to have a softer, gentler appearance. For example, the base <b>131</b> and the tab <b>138</b> of the corner <b>130</b> may have a smooth rounded shape for the top portion <b>302</b> of the soft goods <b>300</b> to wrap around. The top portion <b>302</b> of the soft goods <b>300</b> may include a snap-fit connector <b>312</b> disposed along an interior portion of the top portion <b>302</b> that couples to a corresponding snap-fit connector <b>139</b> on the corner <b>139</b> as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>27</b>B and <b>27</b>C</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0314" num="0312">In some implementations, the slider <b>120</b> may also include a rounded bottom section <b>170</b> positioned underneath the overhang portion of the tab <b>138</b> when the frame <b>100</b><i>c </i>is unfolded.

<p id="p-0317" num="0315"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>28</b>B</figref> further show the latch mechanism <b>200</b><i>j </i>may be locked and/or unlocked with the soft goods <b>300</b> and, in particular, the top portion <b>302</b> covering the top portion <b>108</b> of the frame <b>100</b><i>c</i>. As shown, the latch catch <b>291</b> may protrude through an opening formed on the top portion <b>302</b> of the soft goods <b>300</b>. The latch member <b>210</b> may be disposed over the top portion <b>302</b> when engaging with the latch catch <b>291</b>. Thus, the latch member <b>210</b> may be left exposed. Furthermore, the internal restoring force generated by the latch member <b>210</b> may also cause at least a portion of the latch member <b>210</b> (e.g., the tab <b>220</b>, the lead-in feature <b>222</b>) to press onto the top portion <b>302</b> of the soft goods <b>300</b>, thus further restraining the soft goods <b>300</b> against the corner <b>130</b>. In other words, the latch member <b>210</b> may function as an integral escutcheon when engaged with the latch catch <b>291</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0318" num="0316">Similar to the playards <b>1000</b><i>a </i>and <b>1000</b><i>b</i>, the frame <b>100</b><i>c </i>of the playard <b>1000</b><i>c </i>may only include the leg support assemblies <b>110</b><i>c </i>and the X-frame assemblies <b>140</b><i>a </i>and <b>140</b><i>b</i>. In some implementations, the frame <b>100</b><i>c </i>may exhibit sufficient mechanical rigidity, stability, and strength to satisfy various consumer safety standards (e.g., ASTM F406-19).

<p id="p-0321" num="0319">In some implementations, the foldable playard, when deployed, may also provide a platform to support various accessories (also referred to herein as a &#x201c;topper&#x201d;) to augment the functionality of the playard. For example, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>23</b>D</figref> shows the frame <b>100</b><i>c </i>of the playard <b>1000</b><i>c </i>may include one or more topper supports <b>161</b> disposed on the respective X-tubes of the X-frame assemblies <b>140</b><i>b</i>. The combination of the topper supports <b>161</b> and the corners <b>130</b> of the leg support assemblies <b>110</b><i>c </i>may support one or more toppers <b>160</b> placed onto the top portion <b>108</b> of the frame <b>100</b><i>c </i>when the playard <b>1000</b><i>c </i>is in the unfolded configuration. The toppers <b>160</b> may be various accessories including, but not limited to a changing table, a bassinet, and a bouncer.</p>
<p id="p-0322" num="0320">In another example, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>32</b>A-<b>32</b>F</figref> show the frame <b>100</b><i>a </i>in the unfolded configuration with a canopy cover assembly <b>400</b><i>a</i>. The canopy cover assembly <b>400</b><i>a </i>may be coupled to the frame <b>100</b><i>a </i>and disposed, in part, above the interior space <b>102</b> of the frame <b>100</b><i>a </i>to support a canopy cover <b>440</b> (see, for example, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>32</b>E</figref>) that covers the interior space <b>102</b>. The canopy cover <b>440</b> may be a compliant and/or flexible component formed from, for example, a textile material. For example, the playard <b>1000</b><i>a </i>may be deployed in an outdoor setting, thus the canopy cover <b>440</b> may provide shade for the child <b>50</b> when placed in the partially enclosed space <b>301</b> of the playard <b>1000</b><i>a. </i></p>
<p id="p-0323" num="0321">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>32</b>A-<b>32</b>C</figref>, the canopy cover assembly <b>400</b><i>a </i>may include multiple canopy support assemblies <b>410</b> that couple to each leg support assembly <b>110</b><i>a </i>of the frame <b>100</b><i>a</i>. Thus, the canopy cover assembly <b>400</b><i>a </i>may fully cover the interior space <b>102</b> (i.e., the canopy cover assembly <b>400</b><i>a </i>is a full canopy cover). In some implementations, the canopy support assemblies <b>410</b> may be substantially identical or identical with the other canopy support assemblies <b>410</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0324" num="0322">Each canopy support assembly <b>410</b> may include a canopy bow <b>412</b> partially disposed above the interior space <b>102</b> to support the canopy cover <b>440</b> and a canopy clip <b>420</b><i>a </i>to couple the canopy bow <b>412</b> to the frame <b>100</b><i>a</i>. For the canopy cover assembly <b>400</b><i>a</i>, the canopy bows <b>412</b> from each canopy support assembly <b>410</b> may be coupled together via a hub <b>450</b><i>a </i>disposed above the interior space <b>102</b> as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>32</b>A</figref>. In some implementations, the hub <b>450</b><i>a </i>may be approximately aligned or aligned to the center of the interior space <b>102</b> when the canopy cover assembly <b>400</b><i>a </i>is mounted to the frame <b>100</b><i>a</i>, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>32</b>C</figref>. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>32</b>B</figref> further shows the respective canopy bows <b>412</b> of the canopy support assemblies <b>410</b> may form a frame or support structure where each canopy bow <b>412</b> is bent, in part, to define the desired shape of the canopy cover <b>440</b> when the canopy cover <b>440</b> is installed onto the canopy support assemblies <b>410</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0325" num="0323"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>32</b>D</figref> shows the canopy clip <b>420</b><i>a </i>may be disposed along an exterior portion of the frame <b>100</b><i>a </i>(i.e., outside the interior space <b>102</b> of the frame <b>100</b><i>a</i>) proximate to the slider <b>120</b> and the top portion <b>108</b> of the frame <b>100</b><i>a </i>when the canopy clip <b>420</b><i>a </i>is coupled to the leg support assembly <b>110</b><i>a</i>. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>32</b>E and <b>32</b>F</figref> show the canopy clip <b>420</b><i>a </i>may include a base <b>422</b> with snap-fit features <b>424</b> that form a snap-fit connector to directly couple the canopy clip <b>420</b><i>a </i>to the leg tube <b>112</b> of one leg support assembly <b>110</b><i>a</i>. Thus, the canopy cover assembly <b>400</b><i>a </i>may be mounted to the frame <b>100</b><i>a </i>without the use of any tools. Furthermore, the canopy cover assembly <b>400</b><i>a </i>may be coupled to the frame <b>100</b><i>a </i>without making any alterations or modifications to the frame <b>100</b><i>a</i>. In this manner, the canopy cover assembly <b>400</b><i>a </i>may not be limited for installation with only the frame <b>100</b><i>a</i>, but instead the canopy cover assembly <b>400</b><i>a </i>may be mounted onto the frames of other playards (e.g., other frames with six leg support assemblies). Said in another way, the canopy cover assembly <b>400</b><i>a </i>may be a universally compatible accessory that the caregiver may separately purchase and/or install onto their playard.</p>
<p id="p-0326" num="0324">The snap-fit features <b>424</b> may generally be shaped to conform with the cross-sectional shape of the leg tube <b>112</b> to ensure the canopy clip <b>420</b><i>a </i>is securely coupled to the leg tube <b>112</b>. For example, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>33</b>A</figref> shows the snap-fit features <b>424</b> may form an oval-shaped channel that matches the oval-shaped cross-section of the leg tube <b>112</b>. In some implementations, the asymmetric cross-section of the leg tube <b>112</b> (e.g., the oval-shaped cross section) may ensure the canopy clip <b>420</b><i>a </i>only couples to the leg tube <b>112</b> with a desired orientation and/or prevents unwanted rotation of the canopy clip <b>420</b><i>a </i>when coupled to the leg tube <b>112</b>. In this manner, the canopy bow <b>4112</b> may be repeatedly and/or reliably positioned and/or oriented with respect to the frame <b>100</b><i>a </i>such that the canopy cover <b>440</b>, when placed onto the canopy support assembly <b>410</b>, provides the desired coverage and/or aesthetic appearance. However, it should be appreciated that in other implementations, the shape of the snap-fit features <b>424</b> may be tailored to match the shape of the leg tubes most commonly used in various playard products (e.g., a circular-shaped leg tube). The snap-fit features <b>424</b> may further include lead-in features <b>425</b> to align the canopy clip <b>420</b><i>a </i>to the leg tube <b>112</b> and/or to deflect the snap-fit features <b>424</b> outwards to facilitate engagement with the leg tube <b>112</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0327" num="0325">In some implementations, the caregiver may thus align and press the canopy clip <b>420</b><i>a </i>along the arrow shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>33</b>A</figref> to engage the snap-fit features <b>424</b> to the leg tube <b>112</b>. In some implementations, the caregiver may instead hook one of the snap-fit features <b>424</b> (e.g., via the corresponding lead-in feature <b>425</b>) onto the leg tube <b>112</b> and then rotate the opposing side of the canopy clip <b>420</b><i>a </i>such that the other snap-fit feature <b>424</b> engages the leg tube <b>112</b> (e.g., via the corresponding lead-in feature <b>425</b>) as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>33</b>B</figref>. Compared to conventional canopy cover assemblies, the canopy cover assembly <b>400</b><i>a </i>may be more securely and reliably coupled to the frame <b>100</b><i>a </i>by directly coupling the canopy clip <b>420</b><i>a </i>to the leg tube <b>112</b> instead of a portion of the frame covered by soft goods. Thus, the canopy cover assembly <b>400</b><i>a </i>may be less susceptible to being removed accidentally by, for example, wind or the child <b>50</b> when placed into the partially enclosed space <b>301</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0328" num="0326"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>32</b>E and <b>32</b>F</figref> further show the canopy clip <b>420</b><i>a </i>may include a canopy bow opening <b>426</b> (e.g., also referred to herein as a &#x201c;canopy bow socket <b>426</b>&#x201d;) formed, in part, on the base <b>422</b> to receive a first end <b>413</b><i>a </i>of the canopy bow <b>412</b>. Once the first end <b>413</b><i>a </i>of the canopy bow <b>412</b> is inserted into the canopy bow opening <b>426</b>, a fastener may be inserted through the opening <b>432</b> disposed on the side of the base <b>422</b> to securely couple the canopy bow <b>412</b> to the canopy clip <b>420</b><i>a</i>. In some implementations, the canopy clip <b>420</b><i>a </i>may alternatively utilize an integral snap finger to couple the canopy bow <b>412</b> to the canopy clip <b>420</b><i>a </i>via a snap-fit connection.</p>
<p id="p-0329" num="0327">In some implementations, a portion of the canopy bow <b>412</b> may be disposed outside the interior space <b>102</b> of the frame <b>102</b> and positioned proximate to the top portion <b>108</b> of the frame <b>100</b><i>a </i>when coupled to the canopy clip <b>420</b><i>a</i>. For example, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>32</b>D</figref> shows a portion of the canopy bow <b>412</b> may be in substantially parallel or parallel alignment with the leg tube <b>112</b> and positioned next to the corner <b>130</b>. By positioning the canopy bow <b>412</b> to overlap with the top portion <b>108</b> of the frame <b>100</b><i>a</i>, the canopy bow <b>412</b> is less susceptible to being pulled into the partially enclosed space <b>301</b> of the playard <b>1000</b><i>a </i>by the child <b>50</b> compared to conventional playards with canopy cover assemblies. For example, the canopy bow <b>412</b> may be more difficult to reach since the child <b>50</b> has to extend their arms over the corners <b>130</b> of the frame <b>100</b><i>a </i>to grab the canopy bow <b>412</b>. Additionally, even if the child <b>50</b> manages to grab onto the canopy bow <b>412</b>, they have less leverage to pull the canopy cover assembly <b>400</b><i>a </i>into the playard <b>1000</b><i>a </i>due to the canopy bow <b>412</b> overlapping the top portion <b>108</b> of the frame <b>100</b><i>a </i>and the canopy clip <b>420</b><i>a </i>positioned on an exterior portion of the frame <b>100</b><i>a. </i></p>
<p id="p-0330" num="0328">The canopy clip <b>420</b><i>a </i>may further include an alignment rib <b>430</b> that protrudes outwards from the base <b>422</b> towards the frame <b>100</b><i>a</i>. The alignment rib <b>430</b> may be used, in part, as an alignment feature to position the canopy clip <b>420</b><i>a </i>onto the leg support assembly <b>110</b><i>a</i>. For example, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>42</b>D-F</figref> show the alignment rib <b>430</b> may be disposed between the top surface of the slider <b>120</b> and the bottom surface of the corner <b>130</b> such that the snap-fit features <b>424</b> are disposed just below the slider <b>120</b> when the canopy clip <b>420</b><i>a </i>is coupled to the leg tube <b>112</b>. In some implementations, the alignment rib <b>430</b> may also prevent the canopy clip <b>420</b><i>a </i>from sliding downwards along the leg tube <b>112</b>. For example, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>32</b>E</figref> shows the alignment rib <b>430</b> may contact the top surface of the slider <b>120</b> if the canopy clip <b>420</b><i>a </i>moves down along the leg tube <b>112</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0331" num="0329">In some implementations, the canopy cover <b>440</b> may be laid directly over and onto the canopy support assemblies <b>410</b>. The canopy cover <b>440</b> may include one or more tethers <b>442</b> to pull and/or hold the canopy cover <b>440</b> taut along the canopy bows <b>412</b> of the canopy support assemblies <b>410</b>. For example, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>32</b>E</figref> shows each tether <b>442</b> may be looped around a hook <b>428</b> disposed at the bottom of the base <b>422</b> of the canopy clip <b>420</b><i>a. </i></p>
<p id="p-0332" num="0330">The canopy bow <b>412</b>, the canopy clip <b>420</b><i>a</i>, and/or the hub <b>450</b><i>a </i>may be formed from various materials including, but not limited to plastic and fiberglass. In some implementations, the canopy bow <b>412</b> may be formed as a single, mechanically compliant component that may bent into the desired shape to couple the canopy bow <b>412</b> to the hub <b>450</b><i>a </i>and/or the canopy clip <b>420</b><i>a</i>. In some implementations, the canopy bow <b>412</b> may be an assembly of components (e.g., tubes) coupled together via one or more shock cords or bungee cords. The tubes may be fitted to one another to form an assembly of tubes that mechanically function as a single, continuous rod. For example, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>32</b>E</figref> shows the canopy bow <b>412</b> may include an elastic cord <b>414</b> that passes through the canopy bow <b>412</b> to hold the various sections of the canopy bow <b>412</b> together. As shown, the elastic cord <b>414</b> may be terminated with a knot, which may be accessed by the caregiver through an opening <b>434</b> on the base <b>422</b> of the canopy clip <b>420</b><i>a. </i></p>
<p id="p-0333" num="0331">As described above, the canopy cover assembly <b>400</b><i>a </i>may include a hub <b>450</b><i>a </i>that couples the second ends <b>413</b><i>b </i>of each canopy bow <b>412</b> together to form a structure that covers the interior space <b>102</b> of the frame <b>100</b><i>a</i>. In some implementations, the canopy bows <b>412</b> may be coupled to the hub <b>450</b><i>a </i>prior to purchase by a consumer (e.g., the canopy cover assembly <b>400</b><i>a </i>may be assembled at a factory) or by a caregiver when installing the canopy cover assembly <b>400</b><i>a </i>onto the playard <b>1000</b><i>a </i>for the first time. In other words, the canopy bows <b>412</b> may remain coupled to the hub <b>450</b><i>a </i>for subsequent installations of the canopy cover assembly <b>400</b><i>a </i>such that the caregiver only needs to couple the respective canopy clips <b>420</b><i>a </i>to corresponding leg tubes <b>112</b> for setup.</p>
<p id="p-0334" num="0332">In some implementations, the canopy bow <b>412</b> may be rigidly coupled to the hub <b>450</b><i>a </i>(i.e., the second <b>413</b><i>b </i>of the canopy bow <b>412</b> may not translate and/or rotate relative to the hub <b>450</b><i>a</i>). Thus, the canopy bows <b>412</b> of the canopy support assemblies <b>410</b> may be bent to facilitate attachment of the respective canopy clips <b>420</b><i>a </i>to the frame <b>100</b><i>a</i>. In some implementations, the second end <b>413</b><i>b </i>of the canopy bow <b>412</b> may be rotatably coupled to the hub <b>450</b><i>a </i>so that the canopy support assemblies <b>410</b> may be folded into a more compact structure for storage while remaining coupled to the hub <b>450</b><i>a</i>. For example, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>34</b>A and <b>34</b>B</figref> show the hub <b>450</b><i>a </i>may include a base <b>451</b> with multiple openings <b>452</b> to receive the second ends <b>413</b><i>b </i>of each canopy bow <b>412</b>. The openings <b>452</b> may be aligned, in part, according to the relative locations of the leg support assemblies <b>110</b><i>a </i>of the frame <b>100</b><i>a </i>in the unfolded configuration. For example, the hub <b>450</b><i>a </i>may have six openings <b>452</b> disposed evenly around the periphery of the base <b>451</b> to align with the six leg support assemblies <b>110</b><i>a</i>, which may be arranged to form a hexagonal-shaped interior space <b>102</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0335" num="0333">Once the second end <b>413</b><i>b </i>of the canopy bow <b>412</b> is inserted into the opening <b>452</b>, a pin <b>454</b> coupled to the second end <b>413</b><i>b </i>may be held in a corresponding slot <b>453</b> formed in the base <b>451</b> via, for example, a snap-fit connector. This allows the second end <b>413</b><i>b </i>of the canopy bow <b>412</b> to rotate relative to the base <b>451</b> via rotation of the pin <b>454</b> within the slot <b>453</b> about a rotation axis <b>460</b> as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>34</b>B</figref>. In some implementations, the pin <b>454</b> may be integrally formed into the canopy bow <b>412</b>. In some implementations, the pin <b>454</b> may be a separate component that is inserted through openings along the sides of the canopy bow <b>412</b> near the second end <b>413</b><i>b. </i></p>
<p id="p-0336" num="0334">The base <b>451</b> may further include a lip <b>457</b> to constrain the range of rotational motion of the canopy bow <b>412</b> relative to the hub <b>450</b><i>a</i>. For example, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>34</b>B</figref> shows the lip <b>457</b> may be disposed along the bottom side of the base <b>451</b>, which causes the canopy bow <b>412</b> to bend when the canopy clip <b>420</b><i>a </i>attached to the first end <b>413</b><i>a </i>of the canopy bow <b>412</b> is positioned below the hub <b>450</b><i>a</i>. However, the canopy support assemblies <b>410</b> may be allowed to rotate such that the second end <b>413</b><i>b </i>of each canopy bow <b>412</b> is inserted through the opening <b>452</b> from the top side of the base <b>451</b> (i.e., the canopy clip <b>420</b><i>a </i>is positioned above the hub <b>450</b><i>a</i>). In this manner, the canopy cover assembly <b>400</b><i>a </i>may be folded for storage and/or transport separately or together with the playard <b>1000</b><i>a. </i></p>

The connector <b>415</b> may be a tubular-shaped component that receives respective ends of two bow sections <b>416</b>. In some implementations, each bow section <b>416</b> may be coupled to the connector <b>415</b> via a fastener inserted through a corresponding opening on the connectors <b>415</b> and/or an integral snap finger.</p>
<p id="p-0340" num="0338">The canopy clip <b>420</b><i>b </i>may incorporate several of the same features as the canopy clip <b>420</b><i>a </i>described above. For example, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>36</b>D and <b>36</b>E</figref> show the canopy clip <b>420</b><i>b </i>may include a base <b>422</b> with snap-fit features <b>424</b>, a canopy bow opening <b>426</b> to receive one end of the canopy bow <b>412</b>, a mounting hole <b>432</b> to securely couple the canopy bow <b>412</b> to the canopy clip <b>420</b><i>b</i>, an opening <b>434</b> to access the elastic cord in the canopy bow <b>412</b>, and a hook <b>428</b> to secure the tether <b>442</b> of the canopy cover <b>440</b> to the canopy clip <b>420</b>. Compared to the canopy clip <b>420</b><i>a</i>, the canopy bow opening <b>426</b> of the canopy clip <b>420</b><i>b </i>may be tilted such that the portion of the canopy bow <b>412</b> coupled to the canopy clip <b>420</b><i>b </i>is oriented an angle relative to the leg tube <b>112</b> of the leg support assembly <b>110</b><i>a </i>to ensure the canopy bow <b>412</b> extends over a center portion of the interior space <b>102</b> as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>36</b>C</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0341" num="0339"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>37</b>A-<b>37</b>C</figref> show another exemplary canopy cover assembly <b>400</b><i>c </i>without the canopy cover <b>440</b> coupled to the frame <b>100</b><i>a </i>of the playard <b>1000</b><i>a</i>. The canopy cover assembly <b>400</b><i>c </i>may also cover half the interior space <b>102</b> similar to the canopy cover assembly <b>400</b><i>b</i>. However, the canopy support assemblies <b>410</b> of the canopy cover assembly <b>400</b><i>c </i>may be joined together by a hub <b>450</b><i>b </i>in the canopy cover assembly <b>400</b><i>a</i>. As shown, the canopy support assemblies <b>410</b> may include the canopy bows <b>412</b> and canopy clips <b>420</b><i>a </i>described above. In this example, the canopy support assemblies <b>410</b> may couple to enough leg support assemblies <b>110</b><i>a </i>to cover half the interior space <b>102</b> as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>37</b>C</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0342" num="0340"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>38</b>A and <b>38</b>B</figref> show the hub <b>450</b><i>b </i>may once again include a base <b>451</b> with openings <b>452</b> to receive the second ends <b>413</b><i>b </i>of each canopy bow <b>412</b>. As shown, the openings <b>452</b> may be formed as sockets that rigidly couple the second ends <b>413</b><i>b </i>to the hub <b>450</b><i>a </i>such that the second end <b>413</b><i>b </i>of each canopy bow <b>412</b> is translationally and rotationally constrained to the hub <b>450</b><i>b</i>. In some implementations, the second end <b>413</b><i>b </i>may be coupled to the hub <b>450</b><i>b </i>via a fastener and/or a snap-fit connection.</p>
<p id="p-0343" num="0341"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>39</b>A and <b>39</b>B</figref> show another hub <b>450</b><i>c </i>for the canopy cover assembly <b>400</b><i>c</i>, which allows the second end <b>413</b><i>b </i>of the canopy bow <b>412</b> to be rotatable relative to the base <b>451</b> so that the canopy cover assembly <b>400</b><i>c </i>may be folded. The hub <b>450</b><i>c </i>may incorporate several of the same features as the hub <b>450</b><i>a </i>described above. For example, the base <b>451</b> may include a slot <b>453</b> to receive a pin <b>454</b> mounted to the second end <b>413</b><i>b </i>of the canopy bow <b>412</b>. The slot <b>453</b> and the pin <b>454</b> may allow the canopy bow <b>412</b> to rotate about the axis <b>460</b>. The base <b>451</b> may further include a lip <b>457</b> disposed on a bottom side of the base <b>451</b> to limit the rotational motion of the canopy bow <b>412</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0344" num="0342"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>40</b>A and <b>40</b>B</figref> show yet another hub <b>450</b><i>d </i>for the canopy cover assembly <b>400</b><i>c</i>. As shown, the hub <b>450</b><i>d </i>may include a base <b>451</b> with an opening <b>456</b> that extends along the curved side of the base <b>451</b>. The opening <b>456</b> may be shaped to receive the second ends <b>413</b><i>b </i>of multiple canopy bows <b>412</b> as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>40</b>A</figref>. The base <b>451</b> may further include holes <b>455</b> on the top and bottom sides of the base <b>451</b> to couple the second end <b>413</b><i>b </i>of each canopy bow <b>412</b> to the base <b>451</b>. In some implementations, a pin (not shown) may be inserted through the opening <b>455</b> and corresponding openings (not shown) on the canopy bow <b>412</b> such that the second end <b>413</b><i>b </i>of each canopy bow <b>412</b> may rotate about an axis <b>461</b> as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>40</b>A</figref>. This, in turn, may enable the canopy cover assembly <b>400</b><i>c </i>to be folded by rotating each of the canopy bows <b>412</b> about a corresponding axis <b>461</b> to one side of the hub <b>451</b> such that the canopy bows <b>412</b> are approximately parallel or parallel with one another. In some implementations, a fastener may instead be inserted through the openings <b>455</b> to rigidly couple each canopy bow <b>412</b> to the hub <b>450</b><i>d </i>(i.e., the second end <b>413</b><i>b </i>of the canopy bow <b>412</b> does not rotate relative to the base <b>451</b>).</p>

<p id="p-0345" num="0343">All parameters, dimensions, materials, and configurations described herein are meant to be exemplary and the actual parameters, dimensions, materials, and/or configurations will depend upon the specific application or applications for which the inventive teachings is/are used. It is to be understood that the foregoing embodiments are presented primarily by way of example and that, within the scope of the appended claims and equivalents thereto, inventive embodiments may be practiced otherwise than as specifically described and claimed. Inventive embodiments of the present disclosure are directed to each individual feature, system, article, material, kit, and/or method described herein.</p>
<p id="p-0346" num="0344">In addition, any combination of two or more such features, systems, articles, materials, kits, and/or methods, if such features, systems, articles, materials, kits, and/or methods are not mutually inconsistent, is included within the inventive scope of the present disclosure. Other substitutions, modifications, changes, and omissions may be made in the design, operating conditions and arrangement of respective elements of the exemplary implementations without departing from the scope of the present disclosure. The use of a numerical range does not preclude equivalents that fall outside the range that fulfill the same function, in the same way, to produce the same result.</p>
<p id="p-0347" num="0345">Also, various inventive concepts may be embodied as one or more methods, of which at least one example has been provided. The acts performed as part of the method may in some instances be ordered in different ways. Accordingly, in some inventive implementations, respective acts of a given method may be performed in an order different than specifically illustrated, which may include performing some acts simultaneously (even if such acts are shown as sequential acts in illustrative embodiments).</p>
<p id="p-0348" num="0346">All publications, patent applications, patents, and other references mentioned herein are incorporated by reference in their entirety.</p>
<p id="p-0349" num="0347">All definitions, as defined and used herein, should be understood to control over dictionary definitions, definitions in documents incorporated by reference, and/or ordinary meanings of the defined terms.</p>
<p id="p-0350" num="0348">The indefinite articles &#x201c;a&#x201d; and &#x201c;an,&#x201d; as used herein in the specification and in the claims, unless clearly indicated to the contrary, should be understood to mean &#x201c;at least one.&#x201d;</p>
<p id="p-0351" num="0349">The phrase &#x201c;and/or,&#x201d; as used herein in the specification and in the claims, should be understood to mean &#x201c;either or both&#x201d; of the elements so conjoined, i.e., elements that are conjunctively present in some cases and disjunctively present in other cases. Multiple elements listed with &#x201c;and/or&#x201d; should be construed in the same fashion, i.e., &#x201c;one or more&#x201d; of the elements so conjoined. Other elements may optionally be present other than the elements specifically identified by the &#x201c;and/or&#x201d; clause, whether related or unrelated to those elements specifically identified. Thus, as a non-limiting example, a reference to &#x201c;A and/or B&#x201d;, when used in conjunction with open-ended language such as &#x201c;comprising&#x201d; can refer, in one embodiment, to A only (optionally including elements other than B); in another embodiment, to B only (optionally including elements other than A); in yet another embodiment, to both A and B (optionally including other elements); etc.</p>
<p id="p-0352" num="0350">As used herein in the specification and in the claims, &#x201c;or&#x201d; should be understood to have the same meaning as &#x201c;and/or&#x201d; as defined above. For example, when separating items in a list, &#x201c;or&#x201d; or &#x201c;and/or&#x201d; shall be interpreted as being inclusive, i.e., the inclusion of at least one, but also including more than one, of a number or list of elements, and, optionally, additional unlisted items. Only terms clearly indicated to the contrary, such as &#x201c;only one of or &#x201c;exactly one of,&#x201d; or, when used in the claims, &#x201c;consisting of,&#x201d; will refer to the inclusion of exactly one element of a number or list of elements. In general, the term &#x201c;or&#x201d; as used herein shall only be interpreted as indicating exclusive alternatives (i.e. &#x201c;one or the other but not both&#x201d;) when preceded by terms of exclusivity, such as &#x201c;either,&#x201d; &#x201c;one of,&#x201d; &#x201c;only one of,&#x201d; or &#x201c;exactly one of&#x201d; &#x201c;Consisting essentially of&#x201d; when used in the claims, shall have its ordinary meaning as used in the field of patent law.</p>
<p id="p-0353" num="0351">As used herein in the specification and in the claims, the phrase &#x201c;at least one,&#x201d; in reference to a list of one or more elements, should be understood to mean at least one element selected from any one or more of the elements in the list of elements, but not necessarily including at least one of each and every element specifically listed within the list of elements and not excluding any combinations of elements in the list of elements. This definition also allows that elements may optionally be present other than the elements specifically identified within the list of elements to which the phrase &#x201c;at least one&#x201d; refers, whether related or unrelated to those elements specifically identified. Thus, as a non-limiting example, &#x201c;at least one of A and B&#x201d; (or, equivalently, &#x201c;at least one of A or B,&#x201d; or, equivalently &#x201c;at least one of A and/or B&#x201d;) can refer, in one embodiment, to at least one, optionally including more than one, A, with no B present (and optionally including elements other than B); in another embodiment, to at least one, optionally including more than one, B, with no A present (and optionally including elements other than A); in yet another embodiment, to at least one, optionally including more than one, A, and at least one, optionally including more than one, B (and optionally including other elements); etc.</p>
<p id="p-0354" num="0352">In the claims, as well as in the specification above, all transitional phrases such as &#x201c;comprising,&#x201d; &#x201c;including,&#x201d; &#x201c;carrying,&#x201d; &#x201c;having,&#x201d; &#x201c;containing,&#x201d; &#x201c;involving,&#x201d; &#x201c;holding,&#x201d; &#x201c;composed of,&#x201d; and the like are to be understood to be open-ended, i.e., to mean including but not limited to. Only the transitional phrases &#x201c;consisting of and &#x201c;consisting essentially of shall be closed or semi-closed transitional phrases, respectively, as set forth in the United States Patent Office Manual of Patent Examining Procedures, Section 2111.03.</p>
