<p id="p-0002" num="0001">The present invention relates to an apparatus for roasting and grinding coffee beans, and to an associated method for roasting and grinding.</p>
<heading level="1" id="h-0002">TECHNICAL BACKGROUND</heading>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">In all domains of food and beverage preparation, the quality of the prepared food or beverage requires, at least: adequate quality of the raw product; right tools (machines, devices, etc.) and knowledge and skills to ensure the right preparation processes.</p>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">Hot beverage preparation, more particularly coffee preparation and its derivates, also obey the same rules.</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">Since the very first invention of a coffee extraction machine, the associated techniques have heavily evolved during the last decades. It is known in the state of the art that the first machine for making espresso was built and patented in 1884 by Angelo Moriondo of Turin, Italy. An improved design was later patented on April 28, 1903, by Luigi Bezzera. The founder of the La Pavoni company bought the patent and from 1905 produced espresso machines commercially on a small scale in Milan. Multiple machine designs have been created to produce espresso. Several machines share some common elements, such as a group head and a portafilter. An espresso machine may also have a steam wand which is used to steam and froth liquids (such as milk) for coffee drinks such as cappuccino and caffe latte.</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">Present techniques for preparing a coffee beverage involve a skilled person (called a Barista) and dedicated machines/devices to prepare the said coffee beverage. Typically in roast and ground (R&amp;G) coffee, Baristas have the knowledge and the science of coffee to ensure the quality of the prepared cup depending on type of beverage to the prepared, the type of coffee used and the material/means used in the mentioned preparation.</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">Typically, depending on the type of coffee beverage to prepare (espresso, drip coffee type, cold brew, etc.), as well as on the method of extraction used (drip, Chemex, espresso machine, etc.), the Barista chooses the type of coffee (origin, roasting level, etc.), as well as the setting of each machine in the preparation method (the grinder parameters, the extraction method, the water temperature, etc.). In other words, all relies on the knowledge of the Barista, so these types of preparations need a skilled or trained person to ensure that all parameters are correctly set and that the right procedure is followed during the preparation.</p>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">The main object of the present invention is to achieve similar end results of the coffee beverage delivered than those obtained when using a capsule system without the need of using any single serve packaging, and without any specific skills being needed. The invention achieves this by building a system comprising several main-devices that communicate between themselves via accessory-devices, that transfer/communicate the required parameters in order to replace a Barista know-how by an artificial intelligence (AI) system.</p>
<p id="p-0009" num="0008">The system of the invention adjusts the parameters of each main-device (the inputs), according to the outputs of the main-device used in the previous phase. The goal is to ensure the integrity of the procedure and the information by communicating the right parameters to be used.</p>
<p id="p-0010" num="0009">Fully automatic beverage preparation machines are known in the state of the art and are widely used for preparing coffee beverages. These automatic machines provide a fully automatic process, starting with storing the roasted coffee beans and ending with the delivery of the coffee beverage into a cup. Differently to a fully automated machine, the system of the invention allows more flexibility by using different accessory-devices, tailored to the right preparation, between the main-devices. Typically, these accessory-devices are devices for espresso, drip coffee, soluble coffee, etc.</p>
<p id="p-0011" num="0010">Differently to single serve systems (typically those using capsules), the system of the present invention does not use a single packaging for each beverage preparation, but a multipack, and uses accessory-devices for extraction/processing.</p>
<p id="p-0012" num="0011">These and other objects, which become apparent upon reading the following description, are solved by the subject matter of the independent claim. The dependent claims refer to preferred embodiments of the invention.</p>
