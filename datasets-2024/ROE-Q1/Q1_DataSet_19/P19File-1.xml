<p id="p-0079" num="0078">The electric riding machine shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref> can be an electric machine for working indoors or outdoors. In the present example, the electric riding machine is specifically exemplified by the electric riding lawn mower <b>100</b>. The electric riding lawn mower <b>100</b> can be used for the user to ride. When sitting on the electric riding lawn mower, the user can effectively and quickly trim lawn, vegetation, etc. by operating the electric riding lawn mower. Comparing with walk behind lawn mowers, the electric riding lawn mower <b>100</b> of the present disclosure does not require the user to push the machine, nor does it require the user to walk on the ground, and because its large size brings longer endurance, the user is able to trim larger lawns, and trim for a long time with less tiredness. Furthermore, when it comes to power source, the electric riding lawn mower <b>100</b> uses electrical energy rather than gasoline or diesel used by existing riding lawn mowers; this not only costs less and is more environmental friendly, but also requires part replacement less often, reducing maintenance costs.</p>
<p id="p-0080" num="0079">It can be understood that the electric riding machine may be other types of electric machines, as long as the electric machines can output power in other forms in addition to walking power to fulfil other functions besides walking, the electric machines can be considered as riding electric machines, such as riding snow throwers, riding agricultural machines, riding mops, riding sweepers and the like.

In this way, on the one hand, the weight of the whole machine can be reduced, and the cost can be saved; on the other hand, the lower side of the seat <b>12</b> can free more space to set the other two parts, thereby saving space.</p>
<p id="p-0085" num="0084">The power output assembly <b>13</b> includes an output member for outputting power to achieve a mechanical function. For example, in the present example, the output member may specifically be a mowing member <b>131</b>. The power outputted by the power output assembly <b>13</b> is the power other than enabling the electric riding lawn mower <b>100</b> to walk on the ground, and different output members enable the power output assembly <b>13</b> to perform different functions, for example, the output member may blow the snow, the output member may sweep the ground, the output member may also plow the field, etc.</p>
<p id="p-0086" num="0085">In the present example, the output member is the mowing element <b>131</b>, which can realize the function of trimming the lawn, cutting the weeds, and the like. Specifically, the power output assembly <b>13</b> is also connected to the main frame <b>11</b>, and in the present example, the power output assembly <b>13</b> can be specifically mounted to the lower side of the main frame <b>11</b>. It should be understood that the main frame <b>11</b> may be directly connected to the power output assembly <b>13</b>, and may also be indirectly connected through other connection structures to the power output assembly.</p>
<p id="p-0087" num="0086">The power output assembly <b>13</b> is disposed substantially on the lower side of the main frame <b>11</b>, which effectively utilizes the space on the lower side of the main frame <b>11</b>, and reduces the size of the entire electric riding lawn mower <b>100</b> in the front-rear direction such that the whole structure is more compact. Furthermore, it also reduces the center of gravity G<b>1</b> of the electric riding lawn mower <b>100</b>, improves the stability of the electric riding lawn mower <b>100</b>, and avoids the problem of machine rollover and backward turning during climbing.</p>
<p id="p-0088" num="0087">The power output assembly <b>13</b> further includes: a first motor <b>132</b> and a chassis <b>133</b>. The mowing element <b>131</b> is used to implement the mowing function; the first motor <b>132</b> is used to drive the mowing element <b>131</b> to rotate at a high speed; the chassis <b>133</b> is formed with an accommodation space to accommodate at least a portion of the first motor <b>132</b> and at least a portion of the mowing element <b>131</b>. The power output assembly <b>13</b> may include one or more mowing element <b>131</b>, and respectively, the number of the first motors <b>132</b> can correspond to the mowing element <b>131</b>. For example, in the present example, the number of mowing elements <b>131</b> is two, which increases the cutting range of the electric riding lawn mower <b>100</b>, thereby improving the cutting efficiency.</p>
<p id="p-0089" num="0088">The walking assembly <b>14</b> is used to enable the electric riding lawn mower <b>100</b> to walk on the lawn and on the ground. In the up-down direction, the walking assembly <b>14</b> is also capable of supporting the main frame <b>11</b> and the various components on the main frame <b>11</b>. The walking assembly <b>14</b> may specifically include a first travelling wheel <b>141</b> and a second travelling wheel <b>142</b>. The first travelling wheel <b>141</b> is disposed on the front side of the second travelling wheel <b>142</b> in the front-rear direction. Therefore, the first travelling wheel <b>141</b> may also be defined as the front travelling wheel, and the second travelling wheel <b>142</b> may also be defined as the rear travelling wheel. In the present example, the number of the first travelling wheels <b>141</b> is 2, and the number of the second travelling wheels <b>142</b> is also <b>2</b>, which can improve the stability of the electric riding lawn mower <b>100</b> in the left-right direction and avoid rollovers on the ground or up the hill. In fact, the walking assembly <b>14</b> may also include only one first travelling wheel <b>141</b> and two second travelling wheels <b>142</b>; alternatively, the walking assembly <b>14</b> may include two first travelling wheels <b>141</b> and one second travelling wheel <b>142</b>; wherein in the direction along the first straight line <b>101</b>, the power output assembly <b>13</b> is at least partially disposed between the first travelling wheel <b>141</b> and the second travelling wheel <b>142</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0090" num="0089">Further, the power output assembly <b>13</b> is disposed substantially between the first travelling wheel <b>141</b> and the second travelling wheel <b>142</b>; in the direction along the first straight line <b>101</b>, the seat <b>12</b> is also at least partially disposed between the first travelling wheel <b>141</b> and the second travelling wheel <b>142</b>, so that the center of gravity G<b>1</b> of the electric riding lawn mower <b>100</b> is located between the first travelling wheel <b>141</b> and the second travelling wheel <b>142</b> in the direction of the first straight line <b>101</b>, thereby improving the balance performance of the whole machine. Further, in the direction along the first straight line <b>101</b>, the seat <b>12</b> is closer to the second travelling wheel <b>142</b> and further from the first travelling wheel <b>141</b>, so that the electric riding lawn mower <b>100</b> can be effectively prevented from rollover during climbing. In the left-right direction, the two first travelling wheels <b>141</b> are respectively located at two sides of the main frame <b>11</b>, and the two second travelling wheels <b>142</b> are also respectively located at two sides of the main frame <b>11</b>; that is, the projections of the two first walking wheels <b>141</b> in a plane perpendicular to the up-down direction are outside the projection of the main frame <b>11</b> in the plane, and the projections of the two second walking wheels <b>142</b> in the plane are also located outside the projection of the main frame <b>11</b> in the plane. In this way, the main load-bearing portion of the electric riding lawn mower <b>100</b> can be placed between the two first travelling wheels <b>141</b> and also between the two second travelling wheels <b>142</b>, so that the electric riding lawn mower <b>100</b> can be further effectively prevented from rolling over.</p>
<p id="p-0091" num="0090">The first travelling wheel <b>141</b> may specifically be a universal wheel that can rotate about the first axis <b>102</b>. The first travelling wheel <b>141</b> has a first diameter. It can be understood that since the first travelling wheel <b>141</b> is a universal wheel, the electric riding lawn mower <b>100</b> can turn, and when the electric riding lawn mower <b>100</b> turns, the first axis <b>102</b> of first travelling wheel <b>141</b> also rotates, and the orientation of the first travelling wheel <b>141</b> rotates. The walking assembly <b>14</b> also includes a second motor <b>143</b> for driving the second travelling wheel <b>142</b> to rotate about the second axis <b>103</b>. The drive from the second motor <b>143</b> allows the walking assembly to drive the entire electric riding lawn mower <b>100</b> to walk on the ground. In this example, the second motor <b>143</b> is independent of the first motor <b>132</b> that drives the mowing element <b>131</b>, so that the structure of the whole machine is simpler and the driving is more convenient. The number of the second motors <b>143</b> is also two, and the two second motors <b>143</b> are capable of driving the two second travelling wheels <b>142</b> respectively. Thus, when the two second motors <b>143</b> drive the respective second travelling wheels <b>142</b> at different rotational speeds, a speed difference is generated between the two second travelling wheels <b>142</b>, thereby causing the electric riding lawn mower <b>100</b> to turn. The second travelling wheel <b>142</b> has a second diameter, and the second diameter of the second travelling wheel <b>142</b> is greater than the first diameter of the first travelling wheel <b>141</b>. Wherein, the second diameter of the second travelling wheel <b>142</b>, the ratio of the second diameter of the second travelling wheel <b>142</b> to the first diameter of the first travelling wheel <b>141</b> is greater than or equal to 1.4 and less than or equal to 2, such that the second diameter of the second travelling wheel <b>142</b> is larger than the first diameter of the first travelling wheel <b>141</b>, so that the electric riding lawn mower <b>100</b> is less likely to roll backward when climbing uphill. Of course, the second diameter of the second travelling wheel <b>142</b> cannot be excessively larger than the first diameter of the first travelling wheel <b>141</b> to avoid the risk of the electric riding lawn mower <b>100</b> rolling forward on the downhill slope.</p>
<p id="p-0092" num="0091">In the present example, the distance between the second travelling wheel <b>142</b> and the center of the two second travelling wheels <b>142</b> is defined as c1, i.e., half of the distance between the two second travelling wheels <b>142</b> is considered to be c1. In the present example, with a large number of modelling, test analyses, theoretical analysis, and creative work on the electric riding lawn mower <b>100</b>, it is concluded that in order to avoid rollover when the electric riding lawn mower <b>100</b> climbs the uphill, the ratio of the distance c1 between the second travelling wheel <b>142</b> and the center of the two second travelling wheels <b>142</b> to the second diameter of the second travelling wheel <b>142</b> is greater than or equal to 0.5 and less than or equal to 1, such that the distance c1 between the second travelling wheel <b>142</b> and the center of the two second travelling wheels <b>142</b> is not excessively large, and the turning radius of the entire electric riding lawn mower <b>100</b> can be reduced, thereby making the electric riding lawn mower <b>100</b> turns faster.</p>
<p id="p-0093" num="0092">Further, the distance between the center of gravity G<b>1</b> of the electric riding lawn mower <b>100</b> and the two second travelling wheels <b>142</b> in the up-down direction is defined as h1, The ratio of the distance h1 to the second diameter of the second travelling wheel <b>142</b> is greater than or equal to 0.5 and less than or equal to 0.5 and less than or equal to 1, such that when the second diameter of the second travelling wheel <b>142</b> is fixed, the center of gravity G<b>1</b> of the electric riding lawn mower <b>100</b> can be placed in a reasonable position in the up-down direction. Therefore, the risk of rollover of the electric riding lawn mower <b>100</b> during climbing is reduced. The position of the center of gravity G<b>1</b> of the electric riding lawn mower <b>100</b> can be reasonably improved as the second diameter of the second travelling wheel <b>142</b> is increased. In the present example, the ratio of the distance h1 between the center of gravity G<b>1</b> of the electric riding lawn mower <b>100</b> and the center of the two second travelling wheels <b>142</b> in the up-down direction to the distance c1 between the second travelling wheel <b>142</b> and the center of the two second travelling wheels <b>142</b> is greater than or equal to k1 and less than or equal to k2, that is, k1&#x2264;h1/c1&#x2265;k2, and the setting of k1 and k2 is related to the dimension of the second diameter of the second travelling wheel <b>142</b>. Thus, when the second diameter of the second travelling wheel <b>142</b> is set, k1 and k2 can also be set to a reasonable value. Thus, when the distance c1 between the second travelling wheel <b>142</b> and the center of the two second travelling wheels <b>142</b> is set small, the rollover issue during climbing can be alleviated by lowering the center of gravity G<b>1</b> of the electric riding lawn mower <b>100</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0094" num="0093">When the center of gravity G<b>1</b> of the electric riding lawn mower <b>100</b> is set high, the distance c1 between the second travelling wheel <b>142</b> and the center of the two second travelling wheels <b>142</b> can be increased to prevent the electric riding lawn mower <b>100</b> from rollover during climbing. For example, in the present example, k1 has a value of 0.6 and k2 has a value of 1.1, such that 0.6&#x2264;h1/c1 &#x2265;1.1. More specifically, in a direction perpendicular to the first straight line <b>101</b> and perpendicular to the second axis <b>103</b>, the distance L<b>1</b> between the center of gravity G<b>1</b> of the electric riding lawn mower <b>100</b> and the second axis <b>103</b> is greater than or equal to 0 and less than or equal to 150 mm, that is, the distance L<b>1</b> is greater than or equal to 0 and less than or equal to 150 mm in the up-down direction, so that the center of gravity G<b>1</b> of the electric riding lawn mower <b>100</b> is not too high in the up-down direction. When the user sits on the seat <b>12</b>, the center of gravity will rise to some extent, but since the center of gravity G<b>1</b> of the electric riding lawn mower <b>100</b> is set low, the center of gravity G<b>2</b> of the entirety formed by the user and the electric riding lawn mower <b>100</b> is not too high in the up-down direction, which improves stability. It should be noted that, in the present disclosure, the distance between two points, lines and planes in a certain direction refers to the projection distance of the spatial distance between them in the specified direction.</p>
<p id="p-0095" num="0094">The operating assembly <b>15</b> is for user operation to control the electric riding lawn mower <b>100</b> to walk and output power. The operating assembly <b>15</b> can include a first operating element and a second operating element <b>152</b>. The first operating element is for user to operate to activate the first motor <b>132</b> in the power output assembly <b>13</b> to control the mowing element <b>131</b> to mow. The second operating element <b>152</b> is for user to operate to activate the second motor <b>143</b> in the walking assembly <b>14</b> to control the electric riding lawn mower <b>100</b> to walk on the lawn or on the ground. The number of second operating elements <b>152</b> is two. In the present example, two of the second operating elements <b>152</b> are used to respectively control two of the second motors <b>143</b>. The two second operating members <b>152</b> are respectively disposed on both sides of the seat <b>12</b> such that the two second operating members <b>152</b> on both sides can be more conveniently operated when the user sits on the seat <b>12</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0096" num="0095">The power supply device <b>16</b> is for supplying power to the first motor <b>132</b> and the second motor <b>143</b>. The power supply device <b>16</b> includes a plurality of first battery packs <b>161</b>. Compared with the conventional riding lawn mowers powered by gasoline, the electric riding lawn mower <b>100</b> powered by the first battery pack <b>161</b> is more environmental friendly and the later usage cost is also lower. In the long run, the cost of the electric riding lawn mower using the first battery pack <b>161</b> will be lower. Compared with riding lawn mowers powered by alternating current, the first battery pack <b>161</b> supplies power without using a long power cord, which is safer and more convenient for mowing. In the present disclosure, the first battery pack <b>161</b> is a lithium battery pack, and the first battery pack <b>161</b> is lighter in weight, higher in charge and discharge efficiency, and longer in service life than other types of battery packs (for example, lead-acid batteries). Further, in the present example, the voltage of the first battery pack <b>161</b> is 56V. Of course, it can be understood that the voltage value of the first battery pack <b>161</b> is not limited thereto.</p>
<p id="p-0097" num="0096">The power supply device <b>16</b> is disposed on the rear side of the seat <b>12</b>, and in the height direction, the upper end of the power supply device <b>16</b> is shorter than the seat <b>12</b>, or the upper end of the power supply device <b>16</b> is substantially of the same height to the seat <b>12</b>; further, in the height direction, the upper end of the first battery pack <b>161</b> is shorter than the seat <b>12</b>, or the first battery pack <b>161</b> is substantially of the same height to the seat <b>12</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0098" num="0097">In the present example, the first battery pack <b>161</b> can be detached from the main frame <b>11</b> by the user, that is, the first battery pack <b>161</b> for powering the electric riding lawn mower <b>100</b> is detachably mounted to the main frame <b>11</b>, so that when the power of the first battery pack <b>161</b> is insufficient, the user can detach the first battery pack <b>161</b> for charging, instead of directly charging the electric riding lawn mower <b>100</b>, thereby improving operational convenience; in addition, when the first battery pack <b>161</b> is damaged, the user can conveniently disassemble the first battery pack <b>161</b> for maintenance or directly replace the first battery pack <b>161</b>, which avoids fixing or replacing the riding lawn mower whose battery pack cannot be disassembled, and thus reduces the cost of maintenance at a later stage. Moreover, the ability to disassemble the first battery pack <b>161</b> also allows for differentiated design of products for different platforms or regions, making quality control and manufacture of the entire electric riding lawn mower <b>100</b> easier. Still alternatively, the power tool system <b>1</b> shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>8</b></figref> includes the electric riding lawn mower <b>100</b> and a power tool <b>100</b><i>a </i>in the present disclosure. Wherein, the first battery pack <b>161</b> in the power supply device <b>16</b> for supplying power to the electric riding lawn mower <b>100</b> can be detached and mounted into the electric power tool <b>100</b><i>a</i>, so that the first battery pack <b>161</b> can also power the electric power tool <b>100</b><i>a</i>, that is, the first battery pack <b>161</b> in the power supply device <b>16</b> in the present disclosure can be applied not only to the electric riding lawn mower <b>100</b> but also to other electric power tools <b>100</b><i>a</i>, thereby improving the adaptability of the first battery pack <b>161</b> and the ability of the electric riding lawn mower <b>100</b> to adapt to the first battery pack <b>161</b>. Thus, when the electric riding lawn mower <b>100</b> is not in use, the user can disassemble the first battery pack <b>161</b> for use in other electric power tools <b>100</b><i>a</i>, thereby avoiding waste of resources and reducing usage cost. In other words, when the user needs to use the electric riding lawn mower <b>100</b>, the user can borrow the battery pack in other power tool <b>100</b><i>a </i>as the first battery pack <b>161</b>. In the present example, the first battery pack <b>161</b> is configured to be pluggably mounted by the user to the electric riding lawn mower <b>100</b>, and the first battery pack <b>161</b> is attached and detached by plugging and unplugging, making the operation more convenient, and the positioning of the first battery pack <b>161</b> more accurate.</p>
<p id="p-0099" num="0098">Further, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>9</b></figref>, the first battery pack <b>161</b> includes a plurality of battery cells <b>161</b><i>a </i>connected in series, in parallel, or in a combination of series and parallel. The plurality of battery cells <b>161</b><i>a </i>are combined in one battery case to constitute a whole, and the battery cells <b>161</b><i>a </i>may specifically be lithium-based. Specifically, the power tool <b>100</b><i>a </i>may be a garden tool such as a string trimmer, a hedge trimmer, a blower or a chain saw, a torque output tool such as an electric drill or an electric hammer, a sawing tool such as an electric circular saw, a curve saw or a reciprocating saw, or a grinding tool such as an angle grinder or a sander. Of course, in other examples, the first battery pack <b>161</b> can also be configured to power a hand-push power tool, such as a hand-push lawn mower, a hand-push snow blower, and the like. Thus, the first battery pack <b>161</b> of the present disclosure adapted to the electric riding lawn mower <b>100</b> can be pulled out by the user to be applied to the above power tool <b>100</b><i>a</i>, in other words, the user can borrow the battery packs in the power tool <b>100</b><i>a </i>as the first battery pack <b>161</b> to power the electric riding lawn mower <b>100</b>, thereby improving the versatility of the electric riding lawn mower <b>100</b> and reducing the usage cost.</p>
<p id="p-0100" num="0099">In the present example, the area surrounded by the frame <b>11</b><i>a </i>may be divided into a front portion, a middle portion, and a rear portion in the front-rear direction. The base <b>11</b><i>b </i>only fills the front portion of the frame <b>11</b><i>a</i>, and the middle portion and the rear portion of the frame <b>11</b><i>a </i>are not provided with the base <b>11</b><i>b</i>, and the seat <b>12</b> is provided on the upper side of the middle portion of the frame <b>11</b><i>a</i>, so that the lower side of the seat <b>12</b> and the middle portion of the frame <b>11</b><i>a </i>have more space to for other components, so that the structure of the whole machine is more compact. The rear portion of the frame <b>11</b><i>a </i>and the rear side of the seat have a sufficiently large accommodation space which can be used to house the power supply device <b>16</b>. In the present example, the number of the first battery packs <b>161</b> included in the power supply device <b>16</b> is plural; the number of the first battery packs <b>161</b> is at least 4; the number of the first battery packs <b>161</b> is greater than or equal to 4 and less than or equal to 10. Further, in the present example, the number of the first battery packs <b>161</b> is exemplified by six, so that the electric riding lawn mower <b>100</b> is powered by the plurality of first battery packs <b>161</b>, and on the other hand, the endurance capability of the entire electric riding lawn mower <b>100</b> is improved, thereby avoiding the trouble of repeated charging, and improving the efficiency of work; on the other hand, the power supply device <b>16</b> includes a plurality of first battery packs <b>161</b>, and thus the weight of the power supply device <b>16</b> is heavier. For the entire electric riding lawn mower <b>100</b>, the weight of the power supply device <b>16</b> makes up a large proportion of the weight of the entire electric riding lawn mower <b>100</b>. Therefore, disposing the power supply device <b>16</b> in the rear end of the frame <b>11</b><i>a </i>and on the rear side of the seat <b>12</b> locates the power supply device <b>16</b> at the rear end of the electric riding lawn mower <b>100</b>, thereby enabling the center of gravity G<b>1</b> of the electric riding lawn mower <b>100</b> to move backward, further reducing the possibility of rolling over backwards when the electric riding lawn mower <b>100</b> climbs the slope, and improving the safety performance.</p>
<p id="p-0101" num="0100">Further, the center of gravity G<b>1</b> of the electric riding lawn mower <b>100</b> is disposed on the lower side of the seat <b>12</b>. For the entire electric riding lawn mower <b>100</b>, the seat <b>12</b> is substantially in the middle position in the front-rear direction, and the center of gravity G<b>1</b> of the electric riding lawn mower <b>100</b> is disposed on the lower side of the seat <b>12</b>; thus, the user sitting on the seat <b>12</b> only causes the center of gravity G<b>2</b> of both the user and the electric riding lawn mower <b>100</b> to change only in the up-down direction with respect to the center of gravity G<b>1</b> of the electric riding lawn mower <b>100</b> when the user is not sitting on the seat <b>12</b>. The position of the center of gravity G<b>2</b> does not change in the front-rear direction and the left-right direction, so that the risk of rollover caused by the user sitting on the seat <b>12</b> can be further reduced. The center of gravity G<b>1</b> of the electric riding lawn mower <b>100</b> is disposed on the lower side of the seat <b>12</b>. Therefore, regardless of whether a user with a relatively heavy weight or a user with a relatively light weight operates the electric riding lawn mower <b>100</b>, the center of gravity G<b>2</b> of the entirety constructed by the user and the electric riding lawn mower <b>100</b> will not change in the left-right direction and the front-rear direction, thereby improving the stability of the electric riding lawn mower <b>100</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0102" num="0101">As described above, when the center of gravity G<b>1</b> of the electric riding lawn mower <b>100</b> is lowered in the up-down direction, and if the user sits on the seat <b>12</b>, the center of gravity G<b>2</b> of the entirety constructed by the user and the electric riding lawn mower <b>100</b> will also decline relatively. Thus, when the user rides the electric riding lawn mower <b>100</b> of the present disclosure to climb a slope, the second travelling wheel <b>142</b> has a contact point P with the slope surface, and the projection distance between the center of gravity G<b>2</b> of the entirety constructed by the user and the electric riding lawn mower <b>100</b> and the contact point P in the horizontal direction is B. In the direction perpendicular to the first line <b>101</b> and perpendicular to the second axis <b>103</b>, the distance between the center of gravity G<b>2</b> of the entirety constructed by the user and the electric riding lawn mower <b>100</b> and the slope surface is h, that is, in the direction perpendicular to the slope surface, the distance between the center of gravity G<b>2</b> of the entirety constructed by the user and the electric riding lawn mower <b>100</b> and the slope surface is h. Wherein, the following relationship is satisfied between the projection distance B and the distance h:</p>

</p>
<p id="p-0104" num="0102">Wherein, A is the distance between center of gravity G<b>2</b> of the entirety constructed by the user and the electric riding lawn mower <b>100</b> and the second axis <b>103</b> of the second travelling wheel <b>142</b>; the angle &#x3b1; is the angle between the slope surface and the horizontal plane.</p>
<p id="p-0105" num="0103">From the above relationship between the projection distance B and the distance h, the distance A between center of gravity G<b>2</b> of the entirety constructed by the user and the electric riding lawn mower <b>100</b> and the second axis <b>103</b> of the second travelling wheel <b>142</b> is fixed; and when the angle &#x3b1; formed between the slope surface and the horizontal plane is also fixed, the smaller the distance h between the center of gravity G<b>2</b> of the entirety constructed by the user and the electric riding lawn mower <b>100</b> and the slope surface in a direction perpendicular to the first straight line <b>101</b> and perpendicular to the second axis <b>103</b>, the larger the projection distance B between the center of gravity G<b>2</b> of the entirety constructed by the user and the electric riding lawn mower <b>100</b> and the contact point P in the horizontal direction, which makes the electric riding lawn mower <b>100</b> easier to climb and less likely to roll over.</p>
<p id="p-0106" num="0104">The chassis <b>133</b> and the main frame <b>11</b> also need to be separated by a certain distance to allow the chassis <b>133</b> to waggle up and down. Specifically, the distance between the chassis <b>133</b> and the main frame <b>11</b> should be greater than or equal to 20 mm and less than or equal to 60 mm. In another example, it is also necessary to make the distance between the mowing element <b>131</b> and the ground satisfy the requirement of mowing. Specifically, the distance between the mowing element <b>131</b> and the ground should be greater than or equal to 20 mm and less than or equal to 120 mm. In another example, in the present example, the power of the first motor <b>132</b> is greater than or equal to 500 W and less than or equal to 1500 W, and therefore, the size of the space inside the chassis <b>133</b> also needs to meet the size of the first motor <b>133</b>.</p>

The main body portion <b>16</b><i>b </i>may include a first battery compartment <b>162</b> for mounting the first battery pack <b>161</b>, and the power supply device <b>16</b> may include two or more first battery compartments <b>162</b>, and the number of the first battery compartments <b>162</b> may also be a specific plural. Specifically, in this example, the power supply device <b>16</b> includes six first battery compartments <b>162</b>, and the six first battery compartments <b>162</b> are disposed on the rear side of the seat <b>12</b> away from the first travelling wheel <b>141</b>, that is, in the direction of the first straight line <b>101</b>, the first battery compartment <b>162</b> and the first travelling wheel <b>141</b> are respectively disposed on both sides of the seat <b>12</b>. In this way, the weight of the electric riding lawn mower <b>100</b> can be shifted back, thereby increasing the positive pressure of the second travelling wheel <b>142</b> at the rear end to the ground, thereby increasing grip of the second travelling wheel <b>142</b> of the electric riding lawn mower <b>100</b>, and making climbing uphill easier.</p>
<p id="p-0109" num="0107">Correspondingly, the power supply device <b>16</b> includes six first battery packs <b>161</b>, and each of the first battery packs <b>161</b> can be respectively mounted to each of the first battery compartments <b>162</b>.

The first battery pack <b>161</b> can be detachably inserted into the first groove <b>162</b><i>a </i>along the direction of the second straight line <b>104</b>. The first battery pack <b>161</b> can also be pulled out of the first groove <b>162</b><i>a </i>along the direction of the second straight line <b>104</b>. The cover <b>16</b><i>c </i>has an open state and a closed state, and when the cover <b>16</b><i>c </i>is in the open state, the first groove <b>162</b><i>a </i>is opened and the user can insert the first battery pack <b>161</b> into the first groove <b>162</b><i>a</i>; when the cover <b>16</b><i>c </i>is in the closed state, the first groove <b>162</b><i>a </i>is closed to provide a certain protection to the first battery pack <b>161</b> located in the battery compartment housing <b>16</b><i>a</i>. It can be understood that the first battery compartment <b>162</b> can also be provided with a guiding structure <b>162</b><i>b </i>for guiding the first battery pack <b>161</b> to be inserted into the first groove <b>162</b><i>a </i>in the direction of the second straight line <b>104</b>, such that the first battery pack <b>161</b> can be positioned more accurately in the first groove <b>162</b><i>a</i>. The first battery compartment <b>162</b> may also be provided with a latch <b>162</b><i>c </i>for locking the first battery pack <b>161</b> in the first groove <b>162</b><i>a</i>. The latch <b>162</b><i>c </i>can lock the first battery pack <b>161</b>, and allow the first battery pack <b>161</b> to be pulled out. In this way, the waggle of the first battery pack <b>161</b> can be avoided. The first battery compartment <b>162</b> may also be provided with a pop-up structure <b>162</b><i>d </i>for ejecting the first battery pack <b>161</b>, thereby enabling the user to pull out the first battery pack effortlessly. The first battery compartment <b>162</b> is further provided with an input terminal <b>162</b><i>e </i>to electrically connect to the first battery pack <b>161</b>, and the input terminal <b>162</b><i>e </i>is for introducing the electric energy output by the first battery pack <b>161</b> to the electric riding lawn mower <b>100</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0110" num="0108">The direction of the second straight line <b>104</b> in which the first battery pack <b>161</b> is inserted into the first groove <b>162</b><i>a </i>obliquely intersects with the direction of the first straight line <b>101</b>.

That is, the angle formed between the direction of the second straight line <b>104</b> in which the first battery pack <b>161</b> is inserted into the first groove <b>162</b><i>a </i>and the straight line extending in the up-down direction is greater than 0 degrees and less than or equal to 30 degrees, so that the user can easily insert and remove the first battery pack <b>161</b> without bending largely, thereby making the operation more effortless, and avoiding the user twisting or bending the arm when pulling out the first battery pack <b>161</b>, thereby facilitating the human-machine experience. It can be understood that the six first battery compartments <b>162</b> can also be formed by a single larger battery compartment, that is, the power supply device <b>16</b> may include only one battery compartment, and the plurality of first battery packs <b>161</b> are all installed in this battery compartment.</p>
<p id="p-0111" num="0109">Alternatively, the power supply device <b>16</b> may include only one first battery compartment <b>162</b>; correspondingly, the power supply device <b>16</b> may include only one first battery pack <b>161</b>. That is to say, the number of the first battery compartments <b>162</b> and the number of the first battery packs <b>161</b> are not specifically limited, and the correspondence relationship between the first battery compartment <b>162</b> and the first battery pack <b>161</b> is not limited to the one-to-one correspondence relationship. It can be understood that, in other examples, the direction of the second straight line <b>104</b> in which the first battery pack <b>161</b> is inserted into the first groove <b>162</b><i>a </i>may also be perpendicular to the direction of the first straight line <b>101</b>, and the direction of the second straight line <b>104</b> in which the first battery pack <b>161</b> is inserted into the first groove <b>162</b><i>a </i>may also be parallel to the direction of the first straight line <b>101</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0112" num="0110">In the example, the power supply device <b>16</b> includes six first battery packs <b>161</b>, and the six first battery packs <b>161</b> are disposed on the rear side of the seat <b>12</b>. The six first battery packs <b>161</b> are arranged in a regular shape on the rear side of the seat <b>12</b>. The first battery compartment <b>162</b> disposed on the rear side of the seat <b>12</b> is further disposed on the rear side of the second travelling wheel <b>142</b>. The first battery pack <b>161</b> has a height direction extending in the direction in which it is inserted into the first groove <b>162</b><i>a</i>, and has a longitudinal direction and a width direction perpendicular to the height direction; the dimension of the first battery pack <b>161</b> in the longitudinal direction is greater than the dimension thereof in the width direction. In this example, when the first battery pack <b>161</b> is inserted into the first groove <b>162</b><i>a</i>, the longitudinal direction of the first battery pack <b>161</b> and the second axis <b>103</b> of the second travelling wheel <b>142</b> are parallel to each other, that is, the longitudinal direction of the first battery pack <b>161</b> extends in the left-right direction. Thus, when the user needs to install or remove the first battery pack <b>161</b>, the user does not need to twist the wrist, which improves the comfort of operation.</p>
<p id="p-0113" num="0111">More specifically, the six first battery packs <b>161</b> are arranged in three rows in the front-rear direction, and each row has two first battery packs <b>161</b> arranged in the left-right direction. The two first battery packs <b>161</b> disposed in the left-right direction are defined as one battery unit group, or form a modular power supply device, and the length of the first battery pack <b>161</b> in the left-right direction is greater than the width thereof in the front-rear direction. Thus, two first battery packs <b>161</b> are arranged on a straight line parallel to the left-right direction, and three first battery packs <b>161</b> are arranged on a straight line parallel to the front-rear direction, and the orientation of each first battery pack <b>161</b> is arranged such that its length in the left-right direction is also greater than its length in the front-rear direction. Thus, the dimension of the six first battery packs <b>161</b> is not excessively long in the front-rear direction so as not to increase the size of the entire electric riding lawn mower <b>100</b> in the front-rear direction; and also the dimension of the six first battery packs <b>161</b> is not too small in the left-right direction to effectively utilize the space occupied by the electric riding lawn mower <b>100</b> in the left-right direction. Thereby, the arrangement of the power supply device <b>16</b> is more reasonable, the space is saved, and the modularization is facilitated. Of course, it can be understood that when two first battery packs <b>161</b> in the power supply device <b>16</b> are used as one battery unit group, the power supply device <b>16</b> may also include two battery unit groups, and may further include three or more battery unit groups, thereby facilitating modularization of the power supply device <b>16</b> and implementation of a variety of configurations.</p>
<p id="p-0114" num="0112">In the present example, the capacity of a first battery pack <b>161</b> is greater than or equal to 130 Wh and less than or equal to 1000 Wh. Further, the capacity of a first battery pack <b>161</b> is greater than or equal to 130 Wh and less than or equal to 500 Wh, so that the discharge time of the first battery pack <b>161</b> can also meet the most basic requirements even when only one first battery pack <b>161</b> is included in the power supply device <b>16</b>; or, when the plurality of first battery packs <b>161</b> included in the power supply device <b>16</b> are out of power and the electric riding lawn mower <b>100</b> needs to perform mowing, one first battery pack <b>161</b> or two first battery packs <b>161</b> may be charged first, and after the charging is completed, the one first battery pack or the two first battery packs <b>161</b> are inserted to the first battery compartment <b>162</b> to supply power. Therefore, because the capacity of the first battery pack <b>161</b> is greater than or equal to 130 Wh, the discharge time of the first battery pack <b>161</b> can meet the urgent needs of the user to cut a part of the grass, in other words, does not delay the use. It can be understood that, in the present disclosure, when any of the first battery packs <b>161</b> is installed in the battery compartment housing <b>16</b><i>a</i>, the electric riding lawn mower <b>100</b> can be operated, that is, in the present disclosure, the electric riding lawn mower <b>100</b> is not limited to operate only if all of the first battery compartments <b>162</b> are installed with the first battery packs <b>161</b> capable of supplying power. Alternatively, when the plurality of first battery packs <b>161</b> are mounted to the battery compartment housing <b>16</b><i>a</i>, and some of the first battery packs <b>161</b> are depleted, the electric riding lawn mower <b>100</b> can still operate, thereby improving work efficiency. Further, in the present example, the weight of one first battery pack <b>161</b> is greater than or equal to 0.1 kg and less than or equal to 4 kg, which eases carrying difficulties due to the excessive weight of the first battery pack <b>161</b>. Further, for considerations to allow the electric riding lawn mower <b>100</b> of the present disclosure to borrow battery packs in other electric power tools, it is also necessary to make the weight of the first battery pack <b>161</b> equal to or greater than 0.1 kg and equal to or less than 4 kg. More preferably, the weight of the first battery pack <b>161</b> is greater than or equal to 1 kg and less than or equal to 4 kg, so that the first battery pack <b>161</b> can satisfy the capacity and discharge time demands when the weight of the first battery pack <b>161</b> is not excessively heavy.</p>

Specifically, the discharge power of the first battery pack <b>161</b> is greater than or equal to 500 W and less than or equal to 6500 W. Further, the discharge power of the first battery pack <b>161</b> is greater than or equal to 500 W and less than or equal to 3000 W, which enables the first battery pack <b>161</b> to adapt to the high power needs of the electric riding lawn mower <b>100</b> of the present disclosure. In this example, the power supply device <b>16</b> includes a plurality of first battery packs <b>161</b>, and the plurality of first battery packs <b>161</b> provide an overall discharge power of greater than or equal to 2000 W and less than or equal to 4000 W, which enables the electric riding lawn mower <b>100</b> to output high power, and last a long time, saving the trouble of repeated charging.</p>

<p id="p-0126" num="0124">The first battery pack <b>161</b> may specifically include a first battery pack housing <b>161</b><i>b </i>and a plurality of battery cells <b>161</b><i>a </i>disposed in the first battery pack housing <b>161</b><i>b</i>. The direction in which the battery cells <b>161</b><i>a </i>extends in the first battery pack <b>161</b> is parallel to the direction of the second line <b>104</b> in which the first battery pack <b>161</b> is inserted into the first groove <b>162</b><i>a. </i></p>
<p id="p-0127" num="0125">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>, the electric riding lawn mower <b>100</b> may further be provided with a grass collecting device <b>17</b> for collecting grass, and the grass collecting device <b>17</b> may be detachably connected to the main body portion of the electric riding lawn mower <b>100</b>. The grass collecting device <b>17</b> specifically includes a grass collecting basket <b>171</b> and a connecting pipe <b>172</b>; the grass collecting basket <b>171</b> is for accommodating the cut grass clippings, and the connecting pipe <b>172</b> is connected to the bottom plate <b>133</b> and the grass collecting basket <b>171</b> to deliver the grass clippings to the grass collecting basket <b>171</b>. In the present example, the power supply device <b>16</b> is disposed on the rear side of the seat, and the power supply device <b>16</b> further includes a battery compartment housing <b>16</b><i>a</i>. The plurality of first battery packs <b>161</b> of the power supply device <b>16</b> are arranged substantially in a plane perpendicular to the up-down direction. This allows the shape of the battery compartment housing <b>16</b><i>a </i>to be substantially disposed in the plane such that the upper side of the cover <b>16</b><i>c </i>of the battery compartment housing <b>16</b><i>a </i>and the rear side of the seat <b>12</b> have a large free space, which allows the grass basket <b>171</b> to be placed on the upper side of the battery compartment housing <b>16</b><i>a</i>, thereby saving space, and making the structure of the whole machine more reasonable and more compact. Furthermore, due to its light weight, placing the grass basket <b>171</b> on the rear end of the electric riding lawn mower <b>100</b> does not have a great impact on the center of gravity of the whole machine. Therefore, it can be understood that the center of gravity of the electric riding lawn mower <b>100</b> or the center of gravity of the entirety of the electric riding lawn mower <b>100</b> and the user can be understood as either including the grass collecting device <b>17</b> or not including the grass collecting device <b>17</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0128" num="0126">The electric riding lawn mower <b>200</b> of the second example shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>13</b></figref> may have the same main frame <b>21</b>, seat <b>22</b>, power output assembly <b>23</b>, walking assembly <b>24</b> and operating assembly <b>25</b> as the electric riding lawn mower in the first example. This example only differs from the first example in that the power supply device <b>26</b> includes a second battery pack <b>263</b> besides the first battery compartment <b>262</b> and the first battery pack <b>261</b> as in the first example. The parts of the first example that are compatible with this example can be applied to this example, and details are not described herein.</p>
<p id="p-0129" num="0127">In the present example, the second battery pack <b>263</b> can be disposed on the lower side of the seat <b>22</b>, so that the center of gravity G of the whole machine in the direction along the first straight line <b>201</b> can be as close as possible to the seat <b>22</b> and the first travelling wheel <b>241</b> in order to effectively avoid the problem of tilting up when the electric riding lawn mower <b>200</b> climbs uphill; and this also increases the positive pressure of the first travelling wheel <b>241</b> against the ground and the grip of the first travelling wheel <b>241</b> to prevent the electric riding lawn mower <b>200</b> from slippage when walking on the ground; further, especially when the rear end of the electric riding lawn mower <b>200</b> is provided with the grass collecting device, the structure of the second battery pack <b>263</b> being disposed on the lower side of the seat <b>22</b> can effectively reduce the center of gravity G of the electric riding lawn mower <b>200</b>, thereby improving the stability of the whole machine. Further, the second battery pack <b>263</b> is also disposed on the front side of the second travelling wheel <b>242</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0130" num="0128">In addition, in the example, the second battery pack <b>263</b> may be fixedly mounted to the main frame <b>21</b>, that is, the second battery pack <b>263</b> is not quickly removable by the user without using auxiliary tools, so that the second battery pack <b>263</b> can be fixed on the main frame <b>21</b> to continuously supply power to the electric riding lawn mower <b>200</b>, thereby avoiding the situation when both the first battery pack <b>261</b> and the second battery pack <b>263</b> in the power supply device <b>26</b> are removed by the user such that the walking assembly <b>14</b> does not have power supply and that the electric riding lawn mower <b>200</b> cannot walk. Of course, it can be understood that the second battery pack <b>263</b> can also be configured to be detachable or pluggable by the user.</p>
<p id="p-0131" num="0129">The position of the second battery pack <b>263</b> is not limited to being disposed on the lower side of the seat <b>22</b>, in fact, as long as it is distinguished from the position of the first battery pack <b>261</b> because of considerations in balance performance or structural adaptation of the whole machine, it is within the scope of this disclosure.</p>
<p id="p-0132" num="0130">In the present example, only one second battery pack <b>263</b> is provided on the lower side of the seat <b>22</b>. Of course, it can be understood that the second battery pack <b>263</b> on the lower side of the seat <b>22</b> may also be two or more. In the direction perpendicular to the first line <b>201</b> and the first axis <b>202</b>, the distance between the center of gravity of the entirety formed by all the battery packs in the power supply device <b>16</b> and the second axis <b>203</b> is less than 300 mm, that is, the distance between the center of gravity of the entirety formed by all the first battery packs <b>261</b> plus all the second battery packs <b>263</b> and the second axis <b>203</b> is less than 300 mm, such that the center of gravity of the entire electric riding lawn mower <b>200</b> can be lowered, thereby avoiding the problem of rollover on the slope.</p>
<p id="p-0133" num="0131">In addition, in other examples, it is also possible to configure one or more of the first battery packs <b>261</b> disposed on the rear side of the seat <b>22</b> to be fixedly mounted to the main frame <b>21</b>, which also prevents the electric riding lawn mower <b>200</b> from the problem of being unable to walk due to the lack of power source.</p>
<p id="p-0134" num="0132">In the third example shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>14</b></figref>, the electric riding lawn mower <b>300</b> may have the same main frame <b>31</b>, seat <b>32</b>, power output assembly <b>33</b>, walking assembly <b>34</b> and operating assembly <b>35</b> as the electric riding lawn mower <b>100</b> of the first example. This example only differs from the first example in that the power supply device <b>36</b> includes only a first battery pack <b>361</b> having a larger capacity, and the first battery pack <b>361</b> can be detachably coupled to electric riding lawn mower <b>300</b> with a pluggable approach performed by the user. In the fourth example shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>15</b></figref>, the electric riding lawn mower <b>400</b> may have the same main frame <b>41</b>, seat <b>42</b>, power output assembly <b>43</b>, walking assembly <b>44</b> and operating assembly <b>45</b> as the electric riding lawn mower <b>100</b> of the first example. This example only differs from the first example in that the power supply device <b>46</b> includes a power supply interface <b>46</b><i>a </i>for connecting a backpack power supply device <b>410</b> such that when the user sits in the seat <b>42</b>, the user can carry the backpack power supply device <b>410</b> on the back to facilitate the operation of the electric riding lawn mower <b>400</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0135" num="0133">The basic principles, main features and advantages of the present disclosure have been shown and described above. It should be understood by those skilled in the art that the above-described examples are not intended to limit the disclosure in any way, and the technical solutions obtained by means of equivalent replacement or equivalent transformation are all within the scope of the disclosure.
