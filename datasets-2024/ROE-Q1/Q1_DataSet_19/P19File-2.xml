<heading id="h-0002" level="1">BACKGROUND ART</heading>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">In response to consumers' diversified needs, various drinks have been developed and are commercially available. Saccharides such as sucrose are components very commonly blended in drinks for the purpose of, for example, conferring sweetness. However, their influence on health due to excessive consumption has been pointed out. Thus, there are growing needs for lower calorie and naturally derived sweeteners. For example, Patent Literature 1 discloses a functional sweetener composition containing a vitamin, a high intensity sweetener, and a sweetness improving composition.</p>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">Steviol glycoside is known as a sweet component contained in a stevia extract. The stevia extract is mainly extracted and purified from a stevia leaf. Stevia is a perennial plant of the family Asteraceae with Paraguay in the South America as its place of origin, and its scientific name is <i>Stevia rebaudiana </i>Bertoni. Stevia contains a component having approximately 300 or more times the sweetness of sugar and is therefore cultivated for use of this sweet component extracted therefrom as a natural sweetener. The presence of various glycosides such as rebaudioside A (hereinafter, &#x201c;rebaudioside A&#x201d; is also abbreviated as &#x201c;Reb&#x201d;), RebB, RebC, RebD, RebE and RebD has been reported as steviol glycoside (Patent Literature 2). Among various steviol glycosides, for example, RebA is evaluated as a high intensity sweetener having good quality of sweetness and is widely used. The other steviol glycosides have also been increasingly found to have their unique sweetness and associated taste.</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">Under these circumstances, a method for screening stevia plant with high RebM content is known (Patent Literature 3).</p>

<p id="p-0064" num="0058">(7) Homozygous for the allele wherein the base at the position corresponding to position 50 of SEQ ID NO: 7 is A.</p>
<p id="p-0065" num="0059">The plant of the present invention is derived from a stevia plant of wild species and has acquired at least one of the genetic features (1) and (2) and at least one of the genetic features (3) to (7), which result in an increase of the RebM content ratio (hereinafter, the combination of at least one of the genetic features (1) and (2) and at least one of the genetic features (3) to (7) is generically referred to as the &#x201c;genetic features of the present invention&#x201d;).</p>
<p id="p-0066" num="0060">The phrase &#x201c;position (or portion) corresponding to&#x201d; means the following. In case a sequence identical to a reference sequence (e.g., SEQ ID NOs: 1 to 7, etc.) is present in the genome, it means a position or a portion in the sequence (e.g., 290, 33, 44, 40, 48, 55-72, 50, etc.) present in the genome, and in case a sequence identical to the reference sequence is not present in the genome, it means a position or portion in a sequence in the genome corresponding to the reference sequence, which corresponds to the position or portion in the reference sequence. Whether or not a sequence identical to or corresponding to the reference sequence exists in the genome can be determined by, for example, amplifying genomic DNA of the stevia plant of interest with a primer capable of amplifying the reference sequence by PCR, sequencing the amplified product, and performing alignment analysis between the obtained sequence and the reference sequence. Non-limiting examples of a sequence corresponding to a reference sequence include, for example, a nucleotide sequence having a sequence identity of 60% or more, 70% or more, 75% or more, 80% or more, 81% or more, 82% or more, 83% or more, 84% or more, 85% or more, 86% or more, 87% or more, 88% or more, 89% or more, 90% or more, 91% or more, 92% or more, 93% or more, 94% or more, 95% or more, 96% or more, 97% or more, 98% or more, 98.1% or more, 98.4% or more, 98.7% or more, 99% or more, 99.2% or more, 99.5% or more, or 99.8% or more to the reference sequence. The position or portion corresponding to the position or portion in the reference sequence in the sequence corresponding to the reference sequence in the genome can be determined by taking into account the nucleotide sequence before and after the position or portion in the reference sequence and the like. For example, a position or portion in the sequence corresponding to the reference sequence in the genome corresponding to a position or portion in the reference sequence can be determined by an alignment analysis of a reference sequence with a sequence corresponding to a reference sequence in the genome.</p>
<p id="p-0067" num="0061">For instance, when taking &#x201c;the position corresponding to position 290 of SEQ ID NO: 1&#x201d; of the genetic feature (A) of the present invention as an example, in case the genome of a stevia plant has a portion consisting of a nucleotide sequence identical to SEQ ID NO: 1, &#x201c;the position corresponding to position 290 of SEQ ID NO: 1&#x201d; is position 290 from the 5&#x2032; end of the portion consisting of a nucleotide sequence identical to SEQ ID NO: 1 in the genome. On the other hand, in case the genome of a stevia plant has a portion consisting of a nucleotide sequence which is not identical to, but which corresponds to SEQ ID NO: 1, the genome does not have a portion consisting of a nucleotide sequence identical to SEQ ID NO: 1. Therefore, &#x201c;the position corresponding to position 290 of SEQ ID NO: 1&#x201d; does not necessarily correspond to position 290 from the 5&#x2032; end of the portion corresponding to SEQ ID NO: 1. However, it is possible to identify &#x201c;the position corresponding to position 290 of SEQ ID NO: 1&#x201d; in the genome of such a stevia plant by taking into account the nucleotide sequence before and after the position 290 of SEQ ID NO: 1, and the like. For instance, one can identify &#x201c;the position corresponding to position 290 of SEQ ID NO: 1&#x201d; in the genome of a stevia plant by an alignment analysis of the nucleotide sequence of a portion corresponding to SEQ ID NO: 1 in the genome of a stevia plant and the nucleotide sequence of SEQ ID NO: 1.</p>
<p id="p-0068" num="0062">&#x201c;The portion consisting of a nucleotide sequence corresponding to SEQ ID NO: 1&#x201d; means, for instance, a portion consisting of a nucleotide sequence having a sequence identity of 60% or more, 70% or more, 75% or more, 80% or more, 81% or more, 82% or more, 83% or more, 84% or more, 85% or more, 86% or more, 87% or more, 88% or more, 89% or more, 90% or more, 91% or more, 92% or more, 93% or more, 94% or more, 95% or more, 96% or more, 97% or more, 98% or more, 98.1% or more, 98.4% or more, 98.7% or more, 99% or more, 99.2% or more, 99.5% or more, or 99.8% or more to the nucleotide sequence of SEQ ID NO: 1.</p>

<p id="p-0102" num="0096">The plant of the present invention is derived from a stevia plant of wild species and has acquired the above genetic features which result in an increase of the RebM content ratio. The genetic features may be the ones generated by a genetic modification approach or the ones generated by a non-genetic modification approach. Therefore, the plant of the present invention may be the one obtained by a genetic modification approach or a progeny thereof (hereinafter, may be referred to as &#x201c;genetically modified plant&#x201d;) or the one obtained by a non-genetic modification approach or a progeny thereof (hereinafter, may be referred to as &#x201c;non-genetically modified plant&#x201d;).</p>
<p id="p-0103" num="0097">Herein, examples of the &#x201c;non-genetic modification approach&#x201d; include a method of inducing a variation in the gene of a host cell (or a host plant) without transfection with a foreign gene. Examples of such a method include a method of allowing a mutagen to act on a plant cell. Examples of such a mutagen include ethylmethanesulfonic acid (EMS) and sodium azide. For example, EMS can be used at a concentration such as 0.1%, 0.2%, 0.3%, 0.4%, 0.5%, 0.6%, 0.7%, 0.8%, 0.9%, or 1.0% to treat a plant cell. The treatment time is about 1 hour to about 48 hours, about 2 hours to about 36 hours, about 3 hours to about 30 hours, about 4 hours to about 28 hours, about 5 hours to about 26 hours, or about 6 hours to about 24 hours. The procedures themselves of the treatment are known in the art and can be performed by dipping a water-absorbed seed obtained through a water absorption process in a treatment solution containing the mutagen at the concentration described above for the treatment time described above.</p>
<p id="p-0104" num="0098">Another example of the non-genetic modification approach includes a method of irradiating a plant cell with radiation or light beam such as X-ray, y ray, or ultraviolet ray. In the case of irradiation with ultraviolet ray, a cell irradiated using an appropriate dose (ultraviolet lamp intensity, distance, and time) of ultraviolet ray is cultured in a selective medium or the like, and then, a cell, a callus, or a plant having the trait of interest can be selected. In this operation, the irradiation intensity may be 0.01 to 100 Gr, 0.03 to 75 Gr, 0.05 to 50 Gr, 0.07 to 25 Gr, 0.09 to 20 Gr, 0.1 to 15 Gr, 0.1 to 10 Gr, 0.5 to 10 Gr, or 1 to 10 Gr. The irradiation distance may be 1 cm to 200 m, 5 cm to 100 m, 7 cm to 75 m, 9 cm to 50 m, 10 cm to 30 m, 10 cm to 20 m, or 10 cm to 10 m. The irradiation time may be 1 minute to 2 years, 2 minutes to 1 year, 3 minutes to 0.5 years, 4 minutes to 1 month, 5 minutes to 2 weeks, or 10 minutes to 1 week. The irradiation intensity, distance and time differ depending on the type of radiation or light beam, or the state of the subject to be irradiated (cell, callus, or plant) and can be appropriately adjusted by those skilled in the art.</p>
<p id="p-0105" num="0099">Approaches such as cell fusion, anther culture (haploid induction), and remote crossing (haploid induction) are also known in the art.</p>
<p id="p-0106" num="0100">In general, plant cells may involve a mutation during culture. Therefore, it is preferred to regenerate a plant individual, for more stably maintaining the trait.</p>
<p id="p-0107" num="0101">The scope of the present invention does not exclude a plant obtained by the ex-post facto genetic recombination (e.g., genome editing) with a non-genetically modified stevia plant as a host (e.g., a plant further provided with another trait by genetic recombination with the plant of the present invention as a host).</p>
<p id="p-0108" num="0102">The plant of the present invention is of high RebM content ratio type. The RebM content ratio means the ratio of the content of RebM to the content of the whole steviol glycoside (e.g., TSG) or specific steviol glycoside (e.g., RebD). The content may be, for example, the mass or concentration of the glycoside of interest contained in a stevia dried leaf of a unit mass. The dried leaf refers to a leaf having a water content decreased to 10% by weight or less, 7% by weight or less, 5% by weight or less, 4% by weight or less, 3% by weight or less, 2% by weight or less or 1% by weight or less by drying a fresh leaf. Preferably, the water content of the dried leaf of the plant of the present invention is 3 to 4% by weight.</p>
<p id="p-0109" num="0103">The stevia plant with a high RebM content ratio means that the RebM content ratio is high as compared with a stevia plant that does not have the genetic features of the present invention. The high RebM content ratio means that, for example, the average or median RebM content ratio of a population of the plants of the present invention is higher than that of a population of stevia plants that do not have the genetic features of the present invention, and/or is higher than that of a population of stevia plants having at least one of the genetic features (3) to (7) (e.g., a population of stevia plants selected by a screening method comprising a step of detecting the presence and/or the absence of at least one of the genetic features (3) to (7) but not comprising a step of detecting the presence and/or the absence of at least one of the genetic features (1) and (2)).</p>
<p id="p-0110" num="0104">The total steviol glycoside (TSG) is a generic name for measurable steviol glycosides and includes neither an unknown steviol glycoside nor a steviol glycoside present at a level less than the detection limit.

<p id="p-0180" num="0174">In the case of PCR method, it is preferable to generate a primer such that the 3&#x2032; end portion has a sequence complementary to the site related to the genetic feature of the present invention. By using a primer designed in this way, the polymerase extension reaction proceeds because the primer hybridizes completely to the template if the template sample has the allele related to the genetic feature of the present invention, whereas if the template does not have the allele related to the genetic feature of the present invention, the extension reaction does not occur because the nucleotide at the 3&#x2032; end of the primer mismatches the template. Therefore, PCR amplification is performed using such a primer, and the amplification product is analyzed by agarose gel electrophoresis or the like, and if an amplification product of a predetermined size can be confirmed, the template as the sample has the allele related to the genetic feature of the present invention, and if the amplification product is not present, it can be judged that the template does not have the allele related to the genetic feature of the present invention.</p>

<p id="p-0271" num="0261">Hereinafter, the present invention will be described with reference to Examples, etc. However, the present invention is not limited by these specific embodiments.</p>
<p id="p-0272" num="0262">(1) Generation of Population with High Steviol Glycoside Content</p>
<p id="p-0273" num="0263">A wild type stevia species (commercially available variety) was treated with ethyl methanesulfonate (EMS), and the resultant was seeded and cultivated in a greenhouse within the Suntory World Research Center. An appropriate amount of fresh leaves was sampled from each grown individual, and the concentration of steviol glycoside was quantitatively determined by LC-MS/MS (Shimadzu LCMS8050). Specifically, 0.25 g of the fresh leaves was dried by freeze drying, and 0.05 g of homogenized dry matter thereof was added into a 100-fold amount (5 mL) of pure water. Extraction by ultrasonic treatment for 20 minutes, and centrifugation and filtration were performed, followed by 60-fold dilution with 32% acetonitrile to obtain a liquid sample. The concentration of RebA, RebB, RebC, RebD, RebF, RebM, RebN, RebO and stevioside was quantitatively determined by LC/MS-MS analysis on this 1 mL of liquid sample in a LCMS8050 MRM mode, and individuals having the total concentration of about 5 to 20% were selected and crossed to obtain seeds. Such selection was repeated over four generations to obtain Populations A and B.</p>
<p id="p-0274" num="0264">(2) Gene Analysis of Individuals with High RebM Content Ratio</p>
<p id="p-0275" num="0265">An appropriate amount of fresh leaves was sampled from each individual of Populations A and B, and the concentrations of RebA, RebB, RebC, RebD, RebE, RebF, RebG, RebM, RebN and stevioside (TSG) were quantitatively determined by LC/MS-MS (Shimadzu LCMS8050) in the same way as in the preceding section (1). Also, genomic DNA was extracted from the fresh leaves of some individuals in both the populations, and genetically analyzed using a sequencer (HiSeq 2500, Illumina, Inc.). As a result, the average RebM content ratios (RebM/RebD and RebM/TSG) of the individual group having the genetic features of the present invention were found to tend to be higher than the average TSG contents of individual that did not have the genetic features of the present invention, all the individuals of the population A or B, and the individuals having the genetic features (3) to (7). Accordingly, in order to efficiently detect the genetic features, dCAPS primers for detecting the genetic features (1), (2), (4) and (7) were generated, and the remaining individuals were evaluated for the presence or absence of these genetic features by the dCAPS method. The study by the dCAPS method was omitted for the genetic features (3), (5) and (6), because these genetic features are known to exhibit similar behavior to that of the genetic feature (4) according to WO2019/074089.</p>
<p id="p-0276" num="0266">The following dCAPS primers and restriction enzymes were used.</p>

<p id="p-0278" num="0267">The detection of each genetic feature by the dCAPS method was performed as follows. First, genomic DNA was extracted from the fresh leaves of each individual of Populations A and B, and PCR was performed using the above dCAPS primers for each genetic feature. The above restriction enzyme for each genetic feature was added to the PCR product, and enzymatic reaction was performed at 37&#xb0; C. The restriction enzyme-treated products were electrophoresed using a microchip type electrophoresis apparatus LabChip GX Touch HT (PerkinElmer, Inc.). The presence or absence of the genetic feature was determined on the basis of the obtained band pattern. Specifically, since all the genetic features (1), (2), (4) and (7) are homozygous, an individual for which only a band of a degradation product was found as to the genetic features (1) and (2) was determined as having the genetic features, while an individual for which only a band of a non-degradation product was found as to the genetic features (4) and (7) was determined as having the genetic features.</p>
<p id="p-0279" num="0268">From the results shown in Tables 6 to 8, the tendency found by sequencing was confirmed. In the tables, (1), (2), (4) and (7) mean the genetic features (1), (2), (4) and (7), respectively; &#x201c;Other than X&#x201d; represents an individual that does not have the genetic feature X (e.g., &#x201c;Other than (1)+(7)&#x201d; represents an individual group other than individuals having the combination of the genetic feature (1) and the genetic feature (7)); and &#x201c;(4)/(7)&#x201d; represents an individual having at least one of the genetic feature (4) and the genetic feature (7). The increase rate represents the increase rate in RebM content ratio of an individual group having the genetic features of the present invention (an individual group having the genetic feature (1) and the genetic feature (7), an individual group having the genetic feature (2) and the genetic feature (4), or an individual group having the genetic feature (2) and the genetic feature (7)) with respect to the RebM content ratios of the other individual groups. Although the genetic features (4) and (7) are known as markers for the selections of a high RebM content stevia plant (Patent Literature 2), it is evident that their combinations with the genetic feature (1) or (2) of the present invention can select an individual with a higher RebM content ratio.</p>
