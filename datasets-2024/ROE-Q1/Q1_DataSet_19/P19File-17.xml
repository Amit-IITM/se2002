<heading id="h-0001" level="1">FIELD OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0002" num="0001">The present invention relates to fibrous structures, for example pre-moistened fibrous structures, comprising a novel contact surface (micro protrusion surface), and more particularly, to fibrous structures, for example pre-moistened fibrous structures, having a novel contact surface (micro protrusion surface) formed by one or more contact surface protrusions (micro protrusions) and methods for using the fibrous structures and making the fibrous structures.</p>
<heading id="h-0002" level="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">Pre-moistened fibrous structures, for example wipes and/or floor cleaning pads, in the past have exhibited flat contact surfaces. For example, a known pre-moistened fibrous structure <b>10</b> as shown in Prior Art <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>1</b>A and <b>1</b>B</figref> exhibits a flat, non-patterned, for example non-macro patterned, non-embossed, non-molded, fibrous structure surface <b>12</b>. The flat, non-patterned fibrous structure surface <b>12</b> results in the pre-moistened fibrous structure exhibiting a flat functional contact surface having a functional contact surface surface area of 100% of the total fibrous structure surface's <b>12</b> surface area. In other words, the total fibrous structure surface's <b>12</b> surface area is also the fibrous structure's functional contact surface. Such a flat functional contact surface results in the pre-moistened fibrous structure exhibiting unacceptable friction for a user during use due to phenomenon known as hydrogen bonding. Such high friction can result in flipping and/or chattering of the pre-moistened fibrous structure from the surface (if it is attached to a cleaning implement such as a Swiffer&#xae; sweeper) and/or over exertion by the user during cleaning of surfaces, such as floors.</p>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">Formulators have attempted to overcome these negatives associated with such known pre-moistened &#x201c;flat&#x201d; fibrous structures shown in Prior Art <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>1</b>A and <b>1</b>B</figref> by creating pre-moistened fibrous structures comprising a textured and/or three-dimensional patterned fibrous structure surface. As shown in Prior Art <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>2</b>A and <b>2</b>B</figref>, a known pre-moistened textured fibrous structure <b>10</b> comprises a fibrous structure surface <b>12</b> comprising one or more, for example a plurality of protruding surfaces, for example macro protrusion surface <b>14</b>. The protruding surfaces (macro protrusion surfaces <b>14</b>) are formed by one or more, for example a plurality of macro protrusions <b>16</b> (also referred to herein as pillows). The plurality of the macro protrusions <b>16</b> results in the pre-moistened fibrous structure <b>10</b> exhibiting a protruding surface (a macro protrusion surface <b>14</b>) having a protruding surface surface area (a macro protrusion surface <b>14</b> surface area) of less than 100% of the total fibrous structure surface's <b>12</b> surface area. Creating the macro protrusions <b>16</b> in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>2</b>A and <b>2</b>B</figref> can reduce the fibrous structure surface's <b>12</b> surface area contacting a surface to be contacted by the fibrous structure <b>10</b> during use. Such pre-moistened textured fibrous structures <b>10</b> exhibit reduced friction, for example wet friction, of the pre-moistened textured fibrous structure <b>10</b> compared to the pre-moistened flat fibrous structures <b>10</b> shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>1</b>A and <b>1</b>B</figref>, but they still exhibited consumer negatives because the protruding surfaces (macro protrusion surfaces <b>14</b>) produced by the macro protrusions <b>16</b> were flat, non-textured protruding surfaces (macro protrusion surfaces <b>14</b>). The reduction in friction, for example wet friction, during use was found to be insufficient due in part to the fact that the protruding surfaces (macro protrusion surfaces <b>14</b>) were flat or essentially flat and the continued impact of high levels of hydrogen bonding. As mentioned above, such high friction can result in flipping and/or chattering of the pre-moistened fibrous structure from the surface (if it is attached to a cleaning implement such as a Swiffer&#xae; sweeper) and/or over exertion by the user during cleaning of surfaces, such as floors. In other words, the macro protrusions <b>16</b> and/or protruding surfaces (macro protrusion surfaces <b>14</b>) do not comprise micro protrusions <b>20</b> as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>3</b>C, <b>3</b>D, and <b>4</b>A to <b>4</b>C</figref>, for example.</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">One problem with the known fibrous structures, for example pre-moistened fibrous structures, such as pre-moistened floor cleaning pads, is that the fibrous structure's surface (for example contact surface) of the pre-moistened fibrous structures, which is whatever surface contacts a surface to be cleaned during use, needs to be such that the pre-moistened fibrous structure exhibits sufficient friction to provide consumer visually noticeable removal of soil from the surface and/or on the fibrous structure, which is influenced at least partly by the surface areas of the functional contact surface area that contacts a surface being treated and non-contact surface area of the fibrous structures, during use to provide cleaning of a surface, such as a hard surface, for example a floor, but not exhibit too much friction to create consumer negatives, such as flipping, bunching, and/or stopping of the fibrous structure during use and/or causing the consumer to exert too much effort during use.</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">Accordingly, there is a need for a pre-moistened fibrous structure, such as a pre-moistened floor cleaning pad, that comprises a contact surface (a micro protrusion surface) that overcomes the negatives described above, methods of using such pre-moistened fibrous structures and methods for making such pre-moistened fibrous structures.</p>
<heading id="h-0003" level="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">The present invention fulfills the needs described above by providing a fibrous structure, for example a pre-moistened fibrous structure, comprising a contact surface (micro protrusion surface) comprising a contact surface pattern (micro protrusion surface pattern).</p>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">One solution to the problem identified above is the creation of fibrous structures, for example pre-moistened fibrous structures, such as floor cleaning pads, comprising a contact surface, such as a micro protrusion surface, comprising a contact surface pattern (micro protrusion pattern), such as a pattern of contact surface protrusions (a pattern of micro protrusions).</p>
<p id="p-0009" num="0008">In one example of the present invention, a fibrous structure comprising a fibrous structure surface comprising one or more protruding surfaces (macro protrusion surfaces) wherein at least one of the protruding surfaces (macro protrusion surfaces) comprises a plurality of contact surface protrusions (micro protrusions), is provided.</p>
<p id="p-0010" num="0009">In another example of the present invention, a fibrous structure, for example a pre-moistened fibrous structure comprising a fibrous structure surface that exhibits a fibrous structure surface surface area, wherein the fibrous structure surface comprises a contact surface (micro protrusion surface) that exhibits a contact surface surface area (micro protrusion surface surface area), wherein the contact surface surface area (micro protrusion surface surface area) is less than the fibrous structure surface surface area, and wherein the contact surface (micro protrusion surface) comprises a contact surface pattern (micro protrusion surface pattern), is provided.</p>
<p id="p-0011" num="0010">In another example of the present invention, a fibrous structure, for example a pre-moistened fibrous structure, comprising a fibrous structure surface that exhibits a fibrous structure surface surface area, wherein the fibrous structure surface comprises one or more macro protrusions, wherein at least one of the macro protrusions comprises a contact surface pattern, for example a plurality of micro protrusions, is provided.</p>

<heading id="h-0005" level="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<heading id="h-0006" level="1">Definitions</heading>
<p id="p-0060" num="0085">&#x201c;Fibrous structure&#x201d; as used herein means a structure that comprises a plurality of filaments and/or a plurality of solid additives, such as fibers, for example pulp fibers, for example wood pulp fibers, and/or particles, such as superabsorbent materials. In one example, a fibrous structure according to the present invention means an orderly arrangement of filaments and fibers within a structure in order to perform a function. In another example, a fibrous structure according to the present invention is a nonwoven.</p>
<p id="p-0061" num="0086">Non-limiting examples of processes for making fibrous structures include meltblowing and/or spunbonding processes. In one example, the fibrous structures of the present invention are made via a process comprising meltblowing. In another example, the fibrous structures of the present invention are made by meltblowing and coforming (mixing a plurality of filaments, such as meltblown and/or spunbond, for example meltblown filaments with a plurality of solid additives, such as fibers, for example pulp fibers such as wood pulp fibers, and collecting the mixture on a collection device to form a co-formed fibrous structure).</p>
<p id="p-0062" num="0087">The fibrous structure of the present invention may comprise at least three different surfaces: 1) a fibrous structure surface; 2) a protruding surface (macro protrusion surface); and 3) a contact surface (micro protrusion surface). Each of the surfaces exhibits a surface area, for example the fibrous structure surface exhibits a fibrous structure surface surface area, the protruding surface (macro protrusion surface) exhibits a protruding surface surface area (macro protrusion surface surface area), and the contact surface (micro protrusion surface) exhibits a contact surface surface area (micro protrusion surface surface area). The at least three surfaces and/or surface areas of the surfaces may be identified visually since they will be visually discernible and/or with or without the aid of cross-sectional images of the fibrous structures and/or by MikroCAD images, profiles, and/or measurements according to the MikroCAD Test Method described herein.</p>
<p id="p-0063" num="0088">The fibrous structures of the present invention may be homogeneous or may be layered. If layered, the fibrous structures may comprise at least two and/or at least three and/or at least four and/or at least five layers.</p>
<p id="p-0064" num="0089">The fibrous structures of the present invention may be co-formed fibrous structures.</p>
<p id="p-0065" num="0090">In one example, the fibrous structure, for example the pre-moistened fibrous structure, is a saleable unit and/or a useable unit in a form and/or shape that a consumer purchases and/or uses.</p>
<p id="p-0066" num="0091">&#x201c;Co-formed fibrous structure&#x201d; as used herein means that the fibrous structure comprises a mixture of at least two different materials wherein at least one of the materials, for example a first material, comprises filaments, such as polypropylene filaments, and at least one other material, for example a second material, different from the first material, comprises solid additives, such as pulp fibers and/or particulates. In one example, a co-formed fibrous structure comprises solid additives, such as pulp fibers, such as wood pulp fibers, and filaments, such as polypropylene filaments that are commingled together.</p>
<p id="p-0067" num="0092">As mentioned previously, the fibrous structures <b>10</b> of the present invention may comprise at least three different surfaces; namely, a fibrous structure surface, a protruding surface (macro protrusion surface <b>14</b>), and a contact surface (micro protrusion surface <b>18</b>) formed by micro protrusions <b>20</b>. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>3</b>A-<b>3</b>D</figref> schematically represent the different surfaces of the fibrous structures of the present invention. For example, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b>A</figref> schematically represents the fibrous structure surface <b>12</b> of the fibrous structure <b>10</b>. As used herein, the fibrous structure surface <b>12</b> is considered the &#x201c;flat surface&#x201d; state of the fibrous structure <b>10</b>. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b>B</figref> schematically represents the protruding surface (macro protrusion surface <b>14</b>) as a portion of the fibrous structure surface <b>12</b> of the fibrous structure <b>10</b>. One or more macro protrusions <b>16</b> on the fibrous structure surface <b>12</b> may form one or more, for example all of the protruding surfaces (macro protrusion surfaces <b>14</b>). <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>3</b>C and <b>3</b>D</figref> schematically represent a contact surface (micro protrusion surface <b>18</b>) as a portion of the protruding surface (macro protrusion surface <b>14</b>), which is a portion of the fibrous structure surface <b>12</b> of the fibrous structure <b>10</b>. One or more contact surface protrusions (micro protrusions <b>20</b>) on one or more protruding surfaces (macro protrusion surfaces <b>14</b>) may form one or more, for example all of the contact surfaces (micro protrusion surfaces <b>18</b>). During use of the fibrous structure <b>10</b>, at least one of the contact surfaces (micro protrusion surfaces <b>18</b>) is the surface of the fibrous structure <b>10</b> that contacts a surface being cleaned and/or is most proximal to the surface being cleaned relative to the fibrous structure surface <b>12</b> and the protruding surface (macro protrusion surface <b>14</b>) of the fibrous structure <b>10</b>. In one example, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b>D</figref>, not all of the protruding surfaces (macro protrusion surfaces <b>14</b>) need to comprise contact surface protrusions (micro protrusions <b>20</b>).</p>
<p id="p-0068" num="0093">As schematically shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>3</b>A-<b>3</b>D and <b>4</b>A-<b>4</b>C</figref>, the fibrous structure surface <b>12</b> exhibits a fibrous structure surface surface area, the protruding surface (macro protrusion surface <b>14</b>) exhibits a protruding surface surface area (macro protrusion surface <b>14</b> surface area), and the contact surface (micro protrusion surface <b>18</b>) exhibits a contact surface surface area (micro protrusion surface <b>18</b> surface area), wherein the total contact surface surface area (total micro protrusion surface <b>18</b> surface area) is less than the total protruding surface surface area (total macro protrusion surface <b>14</b> surface area) and/or wherein the total protruding surface surface area (total macro protrusion surface <b>14</b> surface area) is less than the total fibrous structure surface <b>12</b> surface area.

Moreover, when viewed from above, the wipes will be layered on top of each other, or superimposed, such that only the topmost wipe of the stack will be visible. The height of the stack is measured from the bottom of the bottommost wipe in the stack to the top of the topmost wipe in the stack and is provided in units of millimeters (mm).</p>
<p id="p-0118" num="0146">&#x201c;Liquid composition&#x201d; and &#x201c;lotion&#x201d; are used interchangeably herein and refer to any liquid, including, but not limited to a pure liquid such as water, an aqueous solution, a colloid, an emulsion, a suspension, a solution and mixtures thereof. The term &#x201c;aqueous solution&#x201d; as used herein, refers to a solution that is at least about 20% and/or at least about 40% and/or at least about 50% water by weight, and is no more than 99.9% and/or no more than about 99% and/or no more than about 98% and/or no more than about 97% and/or no more than about 95% and/or no more than about 90% water by weight.</p>
<p id="p-0119" num="0147">In one example, the liquid composition comprises water or another liquid solvent. Generally, the liquid composition is of sufficiently low viscosity to impregnate the entire structure of the fibrous structure. In another example, the liquid composition may be primarily present at the fibrous structure surface and to a lesser extent in the inner structure of the fibrous structure. In a further example, the liquid composition is releasably carried by the fibrous structure, that is the liquid composition is carried on or in the fibrous structure and is readily releasable from the fibrous structure by applying some force to the fibrous structure, for example by wiping a surface with the fibrous structure.</p>
<p id="p-0120" num="0148">The liquid compositions used in the present invention are primarily although not limited to, oil in water emulsions. In one example, the liquid composition of the present invention comprises at least 80% and/or at least 85% and/or at least 90% and/or at least 95% by weight water.</p>

<p id="p-0122" num="0150">The liquid composition may also contain salts of the acid or acids used to lower the pH, or another weak base to impart buffering properties to the fibrous structure. The buffering response is due to the equilibrium which is set up between the free acid and its salt. This allows the fibrous structure to maintain its overall pH despite encountering a relatively high amount of bodily waste as would be found post urination or defecation in a baby or adult. In one embodiment the acid salt would be sodium citrate. The amount of sodium citrate present in the lotion would be between 0.01 and 2.0%, alternatively 0.1 and 1.25%, or alternatively 0.2 and 0.7% of the lotion.</p>

<p id="p-0142" num="0167">&#x201c;Saturation gradient index&#x201d; (SGI) is a measure of how well the wipes at the top of a stack retain moisture. The SGI of a stack of wipes is measured as described infra and is calculated as the ratio of the average lotion load of the bottommost wipes in the stack versus the topmost wipes in the stack. The ideal stack of wipes will have an SGI of about 1.0; that is, the topmost wipes will be equally as moist as the bottommost wipes. In the aforementioned embodiments, the stacks have a SGI from about 1.0 to about 1.5.</p>
<p id="p-0143" num="0168">The saturation gradient index for a fibrous structure or wipe stack is calculated as the ratio of the saturation loading of a set number of fibrous structures or wipes from the bottom of a stack to that of the same number of fibrous structures or wipes from the top of the stack. For example, for an approximately 80 count wipe stack, the saturation gradient index is this ratio using 10 wipes from bottom and top; for an approximately 30 count wipe stack, 5 wipes from bottom and top are used; and for less than 30, only the top and bottom single wipes are used in the saturation gradient index calculation. The following equation illustrates the example of an 80 count stack saturation gradient index calculation:</p>

<p id="p-0145" num="0169">A saturation profile, or wetness gradient, exists in the stack when the saturation gradient index is greater than 1.0. In cases where the saturation gradient index is significantly greater than 1.0, e.g. over about 1.5, lotion is draining from the top of the stack and settling in the bottom of the container, such that there may be a noticeable difference in the wetness of the topmost fibrous structures or wipes in the stack compared to that of the fibrous structures or wipes nearest the bottom of the stack. For example, a perfect tub of wipes would have a saturation gradient index of 1.0; the bottommost wipes and topmost wipes would maintain equivalent saturation loading during storage. Additional liquid composition would not be needed to supersaturate the wipes in an effort to keep all of the wipes moist, which typically results in the bottommost wipes being soggy.</p>

<p id="p-0198" num="0222">A non-limiting example of a method for making a fibrous structure according to the present invention is represented in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>8</b>-<b>12</b></figref>. The method <b>50</b> for making a fibrous structure <b>10</b> according to the present invention comprises the steps of: 1) as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>7</b></figref>, collecting a plurality of filaments <b>52</b> and/or a mixture of filaments <b>52</b> and solid additives <b>54</b>, such as fibers, for example pulp fibers, onto a collection device <b>56</b>, which in this case is a patterned molding member <b>54</b>, that imparts a texture to at least one surface of the fibrous structure <b>10</b> ultimately produced by the method and with the aid of a sufficient amount of vacuum applied to the collection device <b>56</b> by vacuum boxes <b>58</b>. This step of collecting the filaments <b>52</b> and/or the mixture of filaments <b>52</b> and solid additives <b>54</b> on the collection device <b>56</b> may comprise subjecting the fibrous structure <b>10</b> while on the collection device <b>56</b> to a consolidation step by passing the fibrous structure <b>10</b> while still on the collection device <b>56</b> through a nip formed by two rolls <b>60</b>, such as steel rolls or a rubber and a steel roll, heated or unheated, flat or patterned, whereby the fibrous structure, while present on the collection device <b>56</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0199" num="0223">The method <b>50</b> shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>8</b></figref> comprises the steps of a) collecting a plurality of filaments <b>52</b> onto a collection device <b>56</b>, for example a belt or fabric, such as a molding member <b>62</b>, to form a scrim component <b>26</b>. In one example, the collection device <b>56</b> such as the molding member <b>62</b> may be a straight run while the filaments <b>52</b> and solid additives <b>54</b> are being collected thereon, unlike as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>8</b></figref>. The collection of the plurality of filaments <b>52</b> onto the collection device <b>56</b> to form the scrim component <b>26</b> is vacuum assisted by one or more vacuum boxes <b>58</b>. It has been found that providing sufficient vacuum aids in the pulling or deflection of the filaments <b>52</b> of the scrim component <b>26</b> into the molding member <b>62</b> such that the contact surface protrusions (micro protrusions <b>20</b>) are formed in the fibrous structure <b>10</b>. For example, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>9</b> and <b>10</b></figref>, a molding member <b>62</b> may comprise a reinforcing element <b>64</b>, such as a woven fabric, and a resin <b>66</b> disposed on the reinforcing element <b>64</b>. The resin <b>66</b> is arranged to form conduits and/or open areas, for example in the form of a pattern, that exposes the reinforcing element <b>64</b>, to the filaments <b>52</b> and/or the mixture of filaments <b>52</b> and solid additives <b>54</b> during the fibrous structure making process. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>10</b></figref>, when the filaments <b>52</b> and/or the mixture of filaments <b>52</b> and solid additives <b>54</b> are deposited onto the collection device <b>56</b>; namely, the molding member <b>62</b>, the filaments <b>52</b> and/or the mixture of filaments <b>52</b> and solid additives <b>54</b> are pulled into the deflection conduits or openings <b>67</b> formed by the resin <b>66</b> of the molding member <b>62</b> and ultimately into the interstices of the reinforcing element <b>64</b> resulting in the formation of a protruding surface (macro protrusion surface <b>14</b>) with a contact surface (micro protrusion surface <b>18</b>) and contact surface protrusions (micro protrusions <b>20</b>). In this example, the vacuum box <b>58</b> supplies sufficient vacuum to pull the filaments <b>52</b> of the scrim component <b>26</b> partially into and/or through the reinforcing element <b>64</b> to create the contact surface protrusions (micro protrusions <b>20</b>). An example of a fibrous structure <b>10</b> according to the present invention is illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>13</b></figref>. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>13</b></figref> shows a fibrous structure <b>10</b> (as represented by a MikroCAD Image and a MikroCAD Profile) that has been subjected to sufficient vacuum during the fibrous structure making process to create one or more contact surface protrusions (micro protrusions <b>20</b>) that form a contact surface (micro protrusion surface <b>18</b>) on one or more macro protrusions <b>16</b> from the fibrous structure's surface <b>12</b>. In comparison, Prior Art <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>14</b></figref> shows a fibrous structure <b>10</b> (as represented by a MikroCAD Image and MikroCAD Profile) that has been subjected to insufficient vacuum (less than that of the fibrous structure shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>13</b></figref>) during the fibrous structure making process such that only one or more macro protrusions <b>16</b> are formed from the fibrous structure's surface <b>12</b>. In other words, no contact surface protrusions (micro protrusions <b>20</b>) are formed in the fibrous structure <b>10</b> of Prior Art <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>14</b></figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0200" num="0224">Depending upon the level of vacuum, the filaments <b>52</b> of the scrim component <b>26</b> and/or the mixture of the filaments <b>52</b> and the solid additives <b>54</b> may conform to the collection device <b>56</b>, for example a molding member <b>62</b>. The filaments <b>52</b> of the present invention may be sourced from a filament source, such as a die <b>68</b>, for example a meltblow die.</p>
<p id="p-0201" num="0225">In one example, once the scrim component <b>26</b> is formed on the collection device <b>56</b>, the next step is to mix, such as commingle, a plurality of solid additives <b>54</b>, such as fibers, for example pulp fibers, such as wood pulp fibers, with a plurality of filaments <b>52</b>, such as in a coform box <b>70</b>, and collecting the mixture on the scrim component <b>26</b> carried on the collection device <b>56</b> to form a core component <b>24</b>. The collection of the mixture may be vacuum assisted by a vacuum box <b>58</b>. The vacuum applied via the vacuum box <b>58</b> to the mixture may be sufficient to achieve a solid additive concentration difference (difference in average weight % of solid additives) between two or more regions of the fibrous structure <b>10</b>. It is believed that the rearrangement of the fibers can take one of two modes dependent on a number of factors such as, for example, filament/fiber length. The filaments may bridge the deflection conduits spanning from one ridge to another ridges and may be merely bent into the space defined by the deflection conduit. The solid additives, for example fibers, such as pulp fibers, for example wood pulp fibers, can actually be transported from the region of the ridges of the collection device <b>56</b> and into the deflection conduits of the collection device <b>56</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0202" num="0226">Optionally, an additional scrim component <b>26</b> comprising filaments <b>52</b> from a filament source, such as a die <b>68</b>, for example a meltblow die, may be added to the core component <b>24</b> to sandwich the core component <b>24</b> between two scrim components <b>26</b>. This additional scrim component may exhibit the same basis weight as the first scrim component <b>26</b>, for example if the fibrous structure <b>10</b> is going to be used as a single-ply fibrous structure, such as a single-ply pre-moistened fibrous structure, for example a single-ply pre-moistened cleaning pad.</p>
<p id="p-0203" num="0227">In one example, for example when the fibrous structure <b>10</b> is used in a multi-ply fibrous structure, the additional scrim component <b>26</b> may exhibit a lower basis weight, for example 1-4 gsm. The additional scrim component <b>26</b> in this case helps to reduce lint from the core component <b>24</b> during winding of the fibrous structure <b>10</b> and subsequent converting with one or more other fibrous structure <b>10</b>, which may be the same, to make a multi-ply fibrous structure. The lower basis weight additional scrim component <b>26</b> may be positioned in the multi-ply fibrous structure such that it forms an interior surface of the multi-ply fibrous structure.</p>
<p id="p-0204" num="0228">While not wishing to be bound by theory, the vacuum applied via the vacuum boxes <b>58</b> to the core and scrim layers may be selected to achieve common intensive properties such as the basis weight, density, or thickness. It is believed that the arrangement of the filaments and solid additives as they accumulate on the collection device may take on different modes dependent on a number of factors such as, for example, filament/fiber length, size of the openings or deflection conduits in the patterned molding member, depth of the deflection conduits in the patterned molding member, filament mobility, fiber mobility, filament temperature hence its drawability, or combinations thereof. The filaments may bridge the deflection conduits spanning from one ridge to other ridges and may be merely bent into the space defined by the deflection conduit while maintaining a position on top of a ridge. The solid additives, for example fibers, such as pulp fibers, for example wood pulp fibers, may be transported or dragged by the vacuum air from the region above the ridges of the collection device <b>56</b>, for example the molding member <b>62</b> and into the deflection conduits or openings <b>67</b> of the collection device <b>56</b>, for example the molding member <b>62</b>, while the continuous filaments will remain on the ridge or top of the deflection conduit as they lack mobility for example because of their length. Generally, the filaments and solid additives will tend to migrate with the path of the air flow as is established by the vacuum air characteristics and the air permeability of the openings <b>67</b> in the molding member <b>62</b>. With such processes occurring across a large number of the filaments and solid additives during laydown as described herein, the intensive properties of the regions may be established.</p>
<p id="p-0205" num="0229">The layered scrim component/core component <b>26</b>/<b>24</b> and optionally scrim component <b>26</b> (fibrous structure <b>10</b>) may then be subjected to pressure via a nip formed by two rolls <b>60</b> and/or plates. In one example, the nip is formed by a flat or even surface rubber roll and a flat or even surface, heated metal roll such that the fibrous structure <b>10</b> is deflected into the collection device <b>56</b>, for example molding member <b>62</b>. Alternatively, this step of subjecting the fibrous structure <b>10</b> to pressure via a nip formed by two rolls or plates could be done as a step after removal from the collection device <b>56</b>. Or, the step of subjecting the fibrous structure <b>10</b> to pressure via a nip formed by two rolls or plates after removal from the collection device <b>56</b> does not need to be done.</p>
<p id="p-0206" num="0230">The collection device <b>56</b>, for example the molding member <b>62</b> may comprise a polymer resin <b>66</b> arranged to impart a three-dimensional pattern to the fibrous structure <b>10</b> being formed thereon and/or to components of the fibrous structure <b>10</b>, such as scrim components <b>26</b> and core components <b>24</b>. The collection device <b>56</b> may be a patterned molding member <b>62</b> that results in the fibrous structure <b>10</b> exhibiting a surface pattern, such as a non-random, repeating pattern. The patterned molding member <b>62</b> may have a three-dimensional pattern on it that gets imparted to the scrim components <b>26</b> and/or the core components <b>24</b> during the process. In one example, the solid additives <b>54</b> are wood pulp fibers, such as SSK fibers and/or Eucalytpus fibers, and the filaments <b>52</b> are polypropylene filaments. The solid additives <b>54</b> may be combined with the filaments <b>52</b>, such as by being delivered to a stream of filaments <b>52</b> from a hammermill (not shown) via a solid additive delivery device (not shown) such as a fiber spreader and/or a forming head and/or eductor. The filaments <b>52</b> may be created by meltblowing from a meltblow die, for example as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>11</b> and <b>12</b></figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0207" num="0231">In one example of the present invention, the core component <b>24</b> is made using a die <b>68</b>, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>11</b> and <b>12</b></figref>, comprising at least one filament-forming hole <b>70</b>, and/or 2 or more and/or 3 or more rows of filament-forming holes <b>70</b> from which filaments <b>52</b> are spun. At least one row of holes contains 2 or more and/or 3 or more and/or 10 or more filament-forming holes <b>70</b>. In addition to the filament-forming holes <b>70</b>, the die <b>68</b> comprises fluid releasing holes <b>72</b>, such as gas-releasing holes, in one example air-releasing holes, that provide attenuation to the filaments formed from the filament-forming holes <b>70</b>. One or more fluid releasing holes <b>72</b> may be associated with a filament-forming hole <b>70</b> such that the fluid exiting the fluid-releasing hole <b>70</b> is parallel or substantially parallel (rather than angled like a knife-edge die) to an exterior surface of a filament <b>52</b> exiting the filament-forming hole <b>70</b>. In one example, the fluid exiting the fluid-releasing hole <b>72</b> contacts the exterior surface of a filament <b>52</b> formed from a filament-forming hole <b>70</b> at an angle of less than 30&#xb0; and/or less than 20&#xb0; and/or less than 10&#xb0; and/or less than 5&#xb0; and/or about 0&#xb0;. One or more fluid-releasing holes <b>72</b> may be arranged around a filament-forming hole <b>70</b>. In one example, one or more fluid-releasing holes <b>36</b> are associated with a single filament-forming hole <b>70</b> such that the fluid exiting the one or more fluid-releasing holes <b>72</b> contacts the exterior surface of a single filament <b>52</b> formed from the single filament-forming hole <b>70</b>. In one example, the fluid-releasing hole <b>70</b> permits a fluid, such as a gas, for example air, to contact the exterior surface of a filament <b>52</b> formed from a filament-forming hole <b>70</b> rather than contacting an inner surface of a filament <b>52</b>, such as what happens when a hollow filament is formed.</p>
<p id="p-0208" num="0232">In one example, the die <b>68</b> comprises a filament-forming hole <b>70</b> positioned within a fluid-releasing hole <b>72</b>. The fluid-releasing hole <b>72</b> may be concentrically or substantially concentrically positioned around a filament-forming hole <b>70</b> such as is shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>11</b> and <b>12</b></figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0209" num="0233">In another example, the die <b>68</b> comprises filament-forming holes <b>70</b> and fluid-releasing holes <b>72</b> arranged to produce a plurality of filaments <b>52</b> that exhibit a broader range of filament diameters than known filament-forming hole <b>70</b> dies, such as knife-edge dies.</p>
<p id="p-0210" num="0234">In still another example, the die comprises a knife-edge die.</p>
<p id="p-0211" num="0235">The process of the present invention may include preparing individual rolls of fibrous structure that are suitable for consumer use. The fibrous structure may be contacted by a bonding agent (such as an adhesive and/or dry strength agent), such that the ends of a roll of fibrous structure product according to the present invention comprise such adhesive and/or dry strength agent.</p>
<p id="p-0212" num="0236">In one example, the fibrous structures are embossed and/or cut into sheets, and collected in stacks of fibrous structures.</p>
<p id="p-0213" num="0237">The process of the present invention may include preparing individual rolls and/or sheets and/or stacks of sheets of fibrous structures that are suitable for consumer use.</p>
<p id="p-0214" num="0238">In one example, one or more of the components of the fibrous structure may be made individually and then combined with one or more other components and/or other fibrous structures. In another example, two or more of the fibrous structures of the present invention may be combined with each other and/or with another fibrous structure to form a multi-ply fibrous structure.</p>
<p id="p-0215" num="0239">The continuous polymer filament diameter distribution of all the components involved can be controlled by adjusting the attenuation process levers. These levers include, but are not limited to, the mass throughput ratio of attenuation fluid to polymer melt, the temperature of the attenuation fluid and polymer melt, spinning nozzle orifice size, polymer melt rheological properties, and polymer melt quenching. In one example, the polymer melt attenuation process can use a jet-to-melt mass ratio between 0 and 27. In another example, the polymer melt is extruded at 350&#xb0; F. while the attenuation fluid was injected at 395&#xb0; F. In two similar examples, polymer melt is either extruded through a 0.018&#x2033; orifice diameter or a 0.015&#x2033; orifice diameter at the same jet-to-melt mass ratio and temperature. In yet another example, different melt flow rate (MFR) combinations of isotactic polypropylene resins can be extruded. In still another example, cold air at 73&#xb0; F. and four times more than the attenuation air by mass is injected into the forming zone and impinges the attenuation jet to drastically decrease polymer and air temperature.</p>
<p id="p-0216" num="0240">Each fibrous structure can have either the same or different fiber diameter distribution as the other fibrous structures. In one example having a three-ply fibrous structure, the two plies sandwiching the center ply can have larger mean filament diameter with the same or different filament diameter distribution to provide more surface roughness. In a variation of the previous example, only one of the outer plies has a larger mean filament diameter with the same or different filament diameter distribution as the core ply, while the other outer ply has a smaller mean filament diameter with the same or different filament diameter distribution as the core ply. In another example involving a one-ply fibrous structure, the mean meltblown filament diameter is increased to provide scaffold structure for larger void space.</p>
<p id="p-0217" num="0241">The process for making fibrous structure <b>10</b> may be close coupled (where the fibrous structure is convolutedly wound into a roll prior to proceeding to a converting operation) or directly coupled (where the fibrous structure is not convolutedly wound into a roll prior to proceeding to a converting operation) with a converting operation to emboss, print, deform, surface treat, thermal bond, cut, stack or other post-forming operation known to those in the art. For purposes of the present invention, direct coupling means that the fibrous structure <b>10</b> can proceed directly into a converting operation rather than, for example, being convolutedly wound into a roll and then unwound to proceed through a converting operation.</p>
<heading id="h-0009" level="2">Molding Members</heading>
<p id="p-0218" num="0242">The fibrous structures of the present invention are formed on molding members <b>62</b>, for example a patterned molding member such as is shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>9</b> and <b>10</b></figref>, that result in the fibrous structures of the present invention.

<p id="p-0225" num="0249"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>15</b>A-<b>15</b>E</figref> show representative examples of fibrous structures made according to the present invention.</p>
<p id="p-0226" num="0250">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>16</b></figref>, a pre-moistened fibrous structure, for example a pre-moistened floor cleaning pad, according to the present invention gives a better consumer signal of optimal utilization of the pre-moistened fibrous structure compared to a prior art pre-moistened fibrous structure shown in Prior Art <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>17</b></figref>. The prior art pre-moistened fibrous structure leaves too much white (non-soiled) area on the pre-moistened fibrous structure after cleaning. It has been found that too much bond surface area (knuckle surface area or in other words fibrous structure surface surface area) on the fibrous structures, such as is the case in Prior Art <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>17</b></figref>, results in the fibrous structures looking underutilized during and/or after use. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>16</b></figref>, the bond surface area (knuckle surface area (the continuous knuckle network) or in other words fibrous structure surface surface area) on the fibrous structure is less than the bond surface area (knuckle surface area (the discrete knuckle pattern) or in other words fibrous structure surface surface area) of the fibrous structure shown in Prior Art <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>17</b></figref>. In one example, the bond surface area (knuckle surface area or in other words fibrous structure surface surface area) is 15% or less and/or less than 15% and/or less than 12% and/or less than 10% and/or less than 7% and/or less than 5% and/or less than 3% to about 1% and/or to about 2% (which means that the pillow surface surface area and micro pillow surface surface area, which is made up of the protruding surface surface area (macro protrusion surface surface area) and/or the contact surface surface area (micro protrusion surface surface area) is greater than 50% and/or greater than 60% and/or at least 85% and/or greater than 85% and/or greater than 88% and/or greater than 90% and/or greater than 93% and/or greater than 95% and/or up to about 99% or up to about 98% of the fibrous structure surface surface area).</p>
<p id="p-0227" num="0251">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>16</b></figref>, the pillow surface surface area of the fibrous structure has been increased (bond surface area has been decreased) compared to the pillow surface area of the fibrous structure of Prior Art <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>17</b></figref>. It has been found that increasing the pillow surface surface area (the protruding surface surface area (macro protrusion surface surface area)) of the fibrous structure makes the fibrous structure look more fully utilized during and/or after use. However, the increased pillow surface surface area negatively increases the friction of the fibrous structure during use. Therefore, it has been found that incorporating a micro pattern, for example a plurality of contact surface protrusions (micro protrusions or micro pillows) on one or more of the protruding surfaces (macro protrusion surfaces or pillow surfaces) decreases the friction of the fibrous structure without negatively impacting the soiled appearance. In other words, by adding the contact surface protrusions (micro protrusions or micro pillows) to one or more protruding surfaces (macro protrusion surfaces or pillow surfaces), the fibrous structures of the present invention still appear to be more fully utilized than the fibrous structure in Prior Art <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>17</b></figref> without exhibiting the friction negatives associated with increased pillow surface surface area (the protruding surface surface area).</p>

<heading id="h-0012" level="1">NON-LIMITING EXAMPLES OF FIBROUS STRUCTURES OF THE PRESENT INVENTION</heading>
<heading id="h-0013" level="1">Process Example 1&#x2014;Process for Making a Two Layer Fibrous Structure of the Present Invention</heading>
<p id="p-0246" num="0270">A 21%:27.5%47.5%:4% blend of Lyondell-Basell PH835 polypropylene: Lyondell-Basell Metocene MF650W polypropylene: Lyondell-Basell Metocene MF650X: Ampacet 412951 opacifier is dry blended, to form a melt blend. A meltblown layer of the meltblown filaments, such as a scrim component, is produced first. This addition of the meltblown scrim component layer can help reduce the lint created from the fibrous structure during use by consumers and is performed prior to any thermal bonding operation of the fibrous structure. The scrim layer can be the same or different than the meltblown filaments in the center formed fibrous structure. To make the meltblown filaments for the exterior layers, A 15.5 inch wide Biax 12 row spinnerette with 192 nozzles per cross-direction inch, commercially available from Biax Fiberfilm Corporation, is utilized. 32 nozzles per cross-direction inch of the 192 nozzles have a 0.018 inch inside diameter while the remaining nozzles are solid, i.e. there is no opening in the nozzle. Approximately 0.2 grams per hole per minute (ghm) of the melt blend is extruded from the open nozzles to form meltblown filaments from the melt blend. Approximately 472 SCFM of compressed air, equivalent to a jet-to-melt mass ratio of 26, is heated such that the air exhibits a temperature of about 395&#xb0; F. at the spinnerette. A forming vacuum pulls air through a collection device, such as a non-patterned forming belt or through-air-drying fabric, thus collecting the meltblown filaments to form a fibrous structure.</p>
<p id="p-0247" num="0271">A 20%:27.5%47.5%:5% blend of Lyondell-Basell PH835 polypropylene: Lyondell-Basell Metocene MF650W polypropylene: Lyondell-Basell Metocene MF650X: Polyvel S1416 wetness agent is dry blended, to form a melt blend. The melt blend is heated to 400&#xb0; F. through a melt extruder. A 15.5 inch wide Biax 12 row spinnerette with 192 nozzles per cross-direction inch, commercially available from Biax Fiberfilm Corporation, is utilized. 24 nozzles per cross-direction inch of the 192 nozzles have a 0.018 inch inside diameter while the remaining nozzles are solid, i.e. there is no opening in the nozzle. Approximately 0.5 grams per hole per minute (ghm) of the melt blend is extruded from the open nozzles to form meltblown filaments from the melt blend. Approximately 320 SCFM of compressed air, equivalent to a jet-to-melt mass ratio of 7, is heated such that the air exhibits a temperature of about 395&#xb0; F. at the spinnerette. Approximately 750 g/minute of Golden Isle (from Georgia Pacific) 4725 semi-treated SSK pulp is defibrillated through a hammermill to form SSK wood pulp fibers (solid additive). Air at a temperature of about 85 to 90&#xb0; F. and about 80% relative humidity (RH) is drawn into the hammermill. Approximately 35 kg/min of air split into two symmetric streams carry the pulp fibers to a solid additive spreader. The solid additive spreader turns the pulp fibers and distributes the pulp fibers in the cross-direction such that the pulp fibers are injected into the meltblown filaments at a 45&#xb0; angle (with respect to the flow of the meltblown filaments). A forming box surrounds the area where the meltblown filaments and pulp fibers are commingled. This forming box is designed to reduce the amount of air allowed to enter or escape from this commingling area. A forming vacuum pulls air through a collection device, such as a patterned belt carrying the first scrim layer, thus collecting the commingled meltblown filaments and pulp fibers to form a fibrous structure comprising a pattern of non-random, repeating microregions, including pillows (macro protrusions) and/or micro pillows (micro protrusions) and knuckles, of differing intensive properties and an exterior scrim layer. The fibrous structure formed by this process comprises about 80% by dry fibrous structure weight of pulp and about 20% by dry fibrous structure weight of meltblown filaments.</p>
<p id="p-0248" num="0272">Another meltblown layer of the meltblown filaments using the same melt blend as the first scrim layer, is added to the opposite side of the above formed fibrous structure. This scrim layer can be the same or different than the meltblown filaments in the center formed fibrous structure or from the scrim on the opposite side. This scrim layer can be used as a process aid to prevent linting during substrate making. To make the meltblown filaments for this exterior layer, A 15.5 inch wide Biax 12 row spinnerette with 192 nozzles per cross-direction inch, commercially available from Biax Fiberfilm Corporation, is utilized. 8 nozzles per cross-direction inch of the 192 nozzles have a 0.018 inch inside diameter while the remaining nozzles are solid, i.e. there is no opening in the nozzle. Approximately 0.18 grams per hole per minute (ghm) of the melt blend is extruded from the open nozzles to form meltblown filaments from the melt blend. Approximately 426 SCFM of compressed air, equivalent to a jet-to-melt mass ratio of 26, is heated such that the air exhibits a temperature of about 395&#xb0; F. at the spinnerette. A forming vacuum pulls air through a collection device, such as a non-patterned forming belt or through-air-drying fabric, thus collecting the meltblown filaments to form a fibrous structure on top of the above formed fibrous structure.</p>
<p id="p-0249" num="0273">The combined structure above can be calendared on the forming fabric to create even more distinct regions of differing intensive properties. The fibrous structure may be convolutedly wound to form a roll of fibrous structure.</p>
<p id="p-0250" num="0274">At least two such roll of fibrous structures can be laminated using adhesive or mechanical bonding to create at least two or more plies structures. In this example, two rolls of the fibrous structures above formed on patterned fabric are unwound such that the patterning sides are facing away. A Nordson adhesive applicator with summit nozzles added 12 gsm of Bostik H2031 adhesive at 170&#xb0; C. onto the non-patterned side of one of the fibrous structure. The glued fibrous structure is laminated to the non-patterned side of the other fibrous structure, and the combined fibrous structure is then send through a nip roll to set the adhesive bond and convolutedly wound to form a roll of fibrous structure.</p>

A forming vacuum operating at 23 mBar pressure pulls air through a collection device, such as a non-macro patterned, weaved forming belt of air permeability of 700 SCFM, thus collecting the meltblown filaments to form a fibrous structure that conforms to the micro texture from the weaving pattern of the collection device. The collection device can also have macro patterns, in which meltblown filaments will first conform to the macro patterns of the collection device, and then conform to the micro weave texture of the reinforcing element of the collection device.</p>

<p id="p-0264" num="0288">A 20%:27.5%47.5%:5% blend of Lyondell-Basell PH835 polypropylene: Lyondell-Basell Metocene MF650W polypropylene: Lyondell-Basell Metocene MF650X: Polyvel S1416 wetness agent is dry blended, to form a melt blend. The melt blend is heated to 400&#xb0; F. through a melt extruder. A 15.5 inch wide Biax 12 row spinnerette with 192 nozzles per cross-direction inch, commercially available from Biax Fiberfilm Corporation, is utilized. 24 nozzles per cross-direction inch of the 192 nozzles have a 0.018 inch inside diameter while the remaining nozzles are solid, i.e. there is no opening in the nozzle. Approximately 0.5 grams per hole per minute (ghm) of the melt blend is extruded from the open nozzles to form meltblown filaments from the melt blend. Approximately 320 SCFM of compressed air, equivalent to a jet-to-melt mass ratio of 7, is heated such that the air exhibits a temperature of about 395&#xb0; F. at the spinnerette. Approximately 750 g/minute of Golden Isle (from Georgia Pacific) 4725 semi-treated SSK pulp is defibrillated through a hammermill to form SSK wood pulp fibers (solid additive). Air at a temperature of about 85 to 90&#xb0; F. and about 80% relative humidity (RH) is drawn into the hammermill. Approximately 35 kg/min of air split into two symmetric streams carry the pulp fibers to a solid additive spreader. The solid additive spreader turns the pulp fibers and distributes the pulp fibers in the cross-direction such that the pulp fibers are injected into the meltblown filaments at a 45&#xb0; angle (with respect to the flow of the meltblown filaments). A forming box surrounds the area where the meltblown filaments and pulp fibers are commingled. This forming box is designed to reduce the amount of air allowed to enter or escape from this commingling area. A forming vacuum operating at 48 mBar pressure pulls air through the same collection device carrying the first said scrim layer, thus collecting the commingled meltblown filaments and pulp fibers to form a fibrous structure on top of the pattern scrim layer. The fibrous structure formed by this process comprises about 80% by dry fibrous structure weight of pulp and about 20% by dry fibrous structure weight of meltblown filaments.</p>
<p id="p-0265" num="0289">A third layer composed of the identical formulation as the first said scrim can be added to the opposite side of the co-formed layer, thus encapsulating the co-form pulp core to prevent linting. To make the meltblown filaments for this exterior layer, A 15.5 inch wide Biax 12 row spinnerette with 192 nozzles per cross-direction inch, commercially available from Biax Fiberfilm Corporation, is utilized. 8 nozzles per cross-direction inch of the 192 nozzles have a 0.018 inch inside diameter while the remaining nozzles are solid, i.e. there is no opening in the nozzle. Approximately 0.18 grams per hole per minute (ghm) of the melt blend is extruded from the open nozzles to form meltblown filaments from the melt blend. Approximately 425 SCFM of compressed air, equivalent to a jet-to-melt mass ratio of 26, is heated such that the air exhibits a temperature of about 395&#xb0; F. at the spinnerette. A forming vacuum operating at 23 mBar pressure pulls air through the same collection device carrying the first said scrim layer and said co-form layer, thus collecting the commingled meltblown filaments to form a fibrous structure opposite side of the first said scrim layer.</p>
<p id="p-0266" num="0290">After the fibrous structure, with additional meltblown filaments (scrim layers) has been formed on the collection device, the fibrous structure is embossed at elevated temperature. In this example, the fibrous structure side with the first said scrim meltblown layer is facing the patterned roll during emboss operation. About 240 PLI (Average pounds per linear CD inch across the patterned molding member CD width of 21&#x2033;), which creates pillows (macro protrusions) and/or micro pillows (micro protrusions) and knuckles, was applied with a flat or even surface metal anvil roll facing the opposite side of the fibrous structure. The metal anvil roll has an internal temperature of 290&#xb0; F. as supplied by an oil heater.</p>
<p id="p-0267" num="0291">The fibrous structure may be convolutedly wound to form a roll of fibrous structure. After the fibrous structure is collected in roll form, it is further converted by being lotioned and cut to form a finished product.</p>
<heading id="h-0017" level="2">Test Methods</heading>
<p id="p-0268" num="0292">Unless otherwise specified, all tests described herein including those described under the Definitions section and the following test methods are conducted on samples that have been conditioned in a conditioned room at a temperature of 23&#xb0; C.&#xb1;1.0&#xb0; C. and a relative humidity of 50%&#xb1;2% for a minimum of 12 hours prior to the test. Except where noted all tests are conducted in such conditioned room, all tests are conducted under the same environmental conditions and in such conditioned room. Discard any damaged product. Do not test samples that have defects such as wrinkles, tears, holes, and like. All instruments are calibrated according to manufacturer's specifications.</p>
<heading id="h-0018" level="2">Mileage Test Method</heading>
<p id="p-0269" num="0293">Mileage of a pre-moistened fibrous structure, for example a pre-moistened floor cleaning pad, is measured as coverage area of the liquid composition distributed on a floor surface. If the pre-moistened fibrous structure is in a package, open the package and remove the pre-moistened wipe, ensuring that the pre-moistened wipe is not subjected to pressure, such as squeezing, that would cause the liquid composition to be expressed from the pre-moistened wipe. If the pre-moistened wipe is in a stack within a package, open the package and remove a pre-moistened wipe from the middle of the stack, again ensuring that the pre-moistened wipe is not subjected to pressure, such as squeezing, that would cause the liquid composition to be expressed from the pre-moistened wipe. This Mileage test is conducted in temperature (70&#xb0; F.) and humidity (45% RH) controlled room. The room should be well-lit to assist visual assessment of liquid distribution. A matte black tile floor (such as Sierra Field Tile in plain black 12 inch square) is chosen to conduct the testing to further assist the observation of streak appearance.</p>
<p id="p-0270" num="0294">A mop sled is constructed from aluminum frame, Teflon bars, velcro and Swiffer&#xae; Sweeper handle, which holds a Swiffer&#xae; Sweeper head in place during mopping and guides the head on the floor.</p>
<p id="p-0271" num="0295">A mop head is modified by cutting off most of the Swiffer&#xae; Sweeper handle, leaving 10 inch bottom part of the handle. During testing, a known weight is put on the mop head to assert constant pressure on the test sample. Because the tester is holding the handle of the sled, no additional pressure is asserted on the wipe sample.</p>
<p id="p-0272" num="0296">Clean the floor with a 20% IPA and 80% water solution. Spray the solution onto the floor liberally and use a squeegee to remove excess fluid. Let the floor dry completely before begin testing. The floor needs to be cleaned with the IPA/water mixture after every 3 testings or when switching test products to remove accumulation of cleaning lotion from wipes.</p>
<p id="p-0273" num="0297">Record the weight of the modified mop head. Attach the pre-moistened fibrous structure to the modified mop head and record the weight. Calculate the difference of those two weights as &#x201c;initial pad weight&#x201d;.</p>

Continue mopping until you have completed 80 ft<sup>2</sup>. Remove the weight from the mop head. It may take a while for the floor to be completely dry. Using Bounty towel drying the floor may significantly shorten the waiting time and decrease the amount of liquid loss due to evaporation from the testing subject. Once the floor is dry place the mop head with the substrate back into the mop sled and apply the weight. Continue to mop in the same fashion as stated previously. Continue mopping until streaks as shown in the 50% coverage image in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>20</b></figref> are visible to tester. This 50% coverage should be on both the forward and backstroke. Stop the test at this point by removing the pre-moistened fibrous structure from the floor surface.

<heading id="h-0020" level="2">Diameter Test Method</heading>
<p id="p-0286" num="0309">The diameter of a fibrous element, for example a filament, discrete or within a fibrous structure is determined by using a Scanning Electron Microscope (SEM) or an Optical Microscope and an image analysis software. A magnification of 200 to 10,000 times is chosen such that the filaments are suitably enlarged for measurement. When using the SEM, the samples are sputtered with gold or a palladium compound to avoid electric charging and vibrations of the filaments in the electron beam. A manual procedure for determining the filament diameters is used from the image (on monitor screen) taken with the SEM or the optical microscope. Using a mouse and a cursor tool, the edge of a randomly selected filament is sought and then measured across its width (i.e., perpendicular to filament direction at that point) to the other edge of the filament. A scaled and calibrated image analysis tool provides the scaling to get actual reading in &#x3bc;m. For filaments within a fibrous structure, several filaments are randomly selected across the sample of the fibrous structure using the SEM or the optical microscope. At least two portions of the fibrous structure are cut and tested in this manner. Altogether at least 100 such measurements are made and then all data are recorded for statistical analysis. The recorded data are used to calculate average (mean) of the filament diameters, standard deviation of the filament diameters, and median of the filament diameters.</p>
<p id="p-0287" num="0310">Another useful statistic is the calculation of the amount of the population of filaments that is below a certain upper limit. To determine this statistic, the software is programmed to count how many results of the filament diameters are below an upper limit and that count (divided by total number of data and multiplied by 100%) is reported in percent as percent below the upper limit, such as percent below 1 micrometer diameter or %-submicron, for example. We denote the measured diameter (in &#x3bc;m) of an individual circular filament as di.</p>
<p id="p-0288" num="0311">In the case that the filaments have non-circular cross-sections, the measurement of the filament diameter is determined as and set equal to the hydraulic diameter which is four times the cross-sectional area of the filament divided by the perimeter of the cross-section of the filament (outer perimeter in case of hollow filaments). The number-average diameter, alternatively average diameter is calculated as:</p>

<p id="p-0290" num="0312">Capacity of a pre-moistened fibrous structure, for example a pre-moistened floor cleaning pad, is measured as coverage area of the liquid composition distributed on a floor surface. If the pre-moistened fibrous structure is in a package, open the package and remove the pre-moistened wipe, ensuring that the pre-moistened wipe is not subjected to pressure, such as squeezing, that would cause the liquid composition to be expressed from the pre-moistened wipe. If the pre-moistened wipe is in a stack within a package, open the package and remove a pre-moistened wipe from the middle of the stack, again ensuring that the pre-moistened wipe is not subjected to pressure, such as squeezing, that would cause the liquid composition to be expressed from the pre-moistened wipe. This Capacity test is conducted in a room that is void of air drafts or other wind that may cause the liquid composition present on a floor to evaporate more quickly than if the air drafts or wind was not present in the room.</p>

The GFM Mikrocad Optical Profiler instrument includes a compact optical measuring sensor based on the digital micro mirror projection, consisting of the following main components: a) DMD projector with 1024&#xd7;768 direct digital controlled micro mirrors, b) CCD camera with high resolution (1300&#xd7;1000 pixels), c) projection optics adapted to a measuring area of at least 44 mm&#xd7;33 mm, and d) matching resolution recording optics; a table tripod based on a small hard stone plate; a cold light source; a measuring, control, and evaluation computer; measuring, control, and evaluation software ODSCAD 4.0, English version; and adjusting probes for lateral (x-y) and vertical (z) calibration.</p>
<p id="p-0296" num="0318">The GFM Mikrocad Optical Profiler system measures the surface height of a fibrous structure sample using the digital micro-mirror pattern projection technique. The result of the analysis is a map of surface height (z) vs. xy displacement. The system has a field of view of 140&#xd7;105 mm with a resolution of 29 microns. The height resolution should be set to between 0.10 and 1.00 micron. The height range is 64,000 times the resolution.</p>
<p id="p-0297" num="0319">The relative height of different portions of a surface of a fibrous structure such as the fibrous structure's surface, a protruding surface (macro protrusion surface) of the fibrous structure and/or a contact surface (micro protrusion surface) of a fibrous structure can be visually determined via a topography image, which is obtained for each fibrous structure sample as described below. At least three samples are measured. Actual height values can be obtained as follows below.</p>
<p id="p-0298" num="0320">To measure the height or elevation of a surface pattern or portion of a surface pattern on a surface of a fibrous structure, for example a fibrous structure product, such as a cleaning pad, the following can be performed: (1) If the fibrous structure, fibrous structure product, or cleaning pad is pre-moistened, dry completely in a conditioned room at a temperature of 50&#xb0; C.&#xb1;1.0&#xb0; C. and a relative humidity of 35%&#xb1;2% and then condition in a conditioned room at a temperature of 23&#xb0; C.&#xb1;1.0&#xb0; C. and a relative humidity of 50%&#xb1;2% for at least 12 hours. (2) Turn on the cold light source. The settings on the cold light source should be 4 and C, which should give a reading of 3000K on the display; (3) Turn on the computer, monitor and printer and open the ODSCAD 4.0 or higher Mikrocad Software; (4) Select &#x201c;Measurement&#x201d; icon from the Mikrocad taskbar and then click the &#x201c;Live Pic&#x201d; button; (5) Place a fibrous structure product sample, for example a cleaning pad, of at least 5 cm by 5 cm in size, under the projection head, without any mechanical clamping, and adjust the distance for best focus; (6) Click the &#x201c;Pattern&#x201d; button repeatedly to project one of several focusing patterns to aid in achieving the best focus (the software cross hair should align with the projected cross hair when optimal focus is achieved). Position the projection head to be normal to the fibrous structure product sample surface, for example the cleaning pad sample surface; (7) Adjust image brightness by changing the aperture on the camera lens and/or altering the camera &#x201c;gain&#x201d; setting on the screen. Set the gain to the lowest practical level while maintaining optimum brightness so as to limit the amount of electronic noise. When the illumination is optimum, the red circle at bottom of the screen labeled &#x201c;I.O.&#x201d; will turn green; (8) Select Standard measurement type; (9) Click on the &#x201c;Measure&#x201d; button. This will freeze the live image on the screen and, simultaneously, the surface capture process will begin. It is important to keep the sample still during this time to avoid blurring of the captured images. The full digitized surface data set will be captured in approximately 20 seconds; (10) Save the data to a computer file with &#x201c;.omc&#x201d; extension. This will also save the camera image file &#x201c;.kam&#x201d;; (11) Export the file to the FD3 v1.0 format; (12) Measure and record at least three areas from each sample; (13) Import each file into the software package SPIP (Image Metrology, A/S, H&#xf8;rsholm, Denmark); (14) Using the Averaging profile tool, draw a profile line perpendicular to height or elevation (such as embossment) transition region. Expand the averaging box to include as much of the height or elevation (embossment) as practical so as to generate and average profile of the transition region (from top surface to the bottom of the surface pattern or portion of surface pattern (such as an embossment) and backup to the top surface.). In the average line profile window, select a pair of cursor points.</p>
<p id="p-0299" num="0321">To move the surface data into the analysis portion of the software, click on the clipboard/man icon; (15) Now, click on the icon &#x201c;Draw Lines&#x201d;. Draw a line through the center of a region of features defining the texture of interest. Click on Show Sectional Line icon. In the sectional plot, click on any two points of interest, for example, a peak and the baseline, then click on vertical distance tool to measure height in microns or click on adjacent peaks and use the horizontal distance tool to determine in-plane direction spacing; and (16) for height measurements, use 3 lines, with at least 5 measurements per line, discarding the high and low values for each line, and determining the mean of the remaining 9 values. Also record the standard deviation, maximum, and minimum. For x and/or y direction measurements, determine the mean of 7 measurements. Also record the standard deviation, maximum, and minimum. Criteria that can be used to characterize and distinguish texture include, but are not limited to, occluded area (i.e. area of features), open area (area absent of features), spacing, in-plane size, and height. If the probability that the difference between the two means of texture characterization is caused by chance is less than 10%, the textures can be considered to differ from one another.</p>
