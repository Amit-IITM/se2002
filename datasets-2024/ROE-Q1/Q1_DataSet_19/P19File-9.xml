<?summary-of-invention description="Summary of Invention" end="lead"?>
<p id="p-0002" num="0001">The present invention relates to an aerosol-generating device comprising visual feedback means provided at the end face of the aerosol generating device that during use points towards the consumer. The present invention also relates to an aerosol-generating system comprising the aerosol-generating device and a removable aerosol-forming article and to a method of operating an aerosol-generating device.</p>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">Visual feedback means are frequently used in electronic aerosol-generating devices to visually provide information to the user. Existing aerosol-generating devices comprising different types of displays in their lateral surfaces are known in the art.</p>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">It is also known to provide end faces that in use point away from the consumer with visual feedback means. Typically, such visual feedback means are used in order to mimic the glow of a conventional cigarette.</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">Currently used visual feedback means are provided at positions of the aerosol-generating devices that cannot be easily observed during the user experience. Since such visual feedback means are usually provided at the sides of the housing of the aerosol-generating device, the aerosol-generating device may have to be turned around to be inspected. Such handling may be perceived as cumbersome by the consumers.</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">It would be desirable to provide an aerosol-generating device having a visual feedback means that can conveniently be checked during the user experience.</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">It would further be desirable to provide an aerosol-generating device having a visual feedback means that can conveniently be checked before, during and after the user experience and which can convey different types of information.</p>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">According to an embodiment of the present invention there is provided an aerosol-generating device comprising an elongate housing having a distal end and a proximal end.</p>
<p id="p-0009" num="0008">During consumption the proximal end of the aerosol-generating device points towards the consumer. The proximal end of the aerosol-generating device comprises a visual feedback means.</p>
<p id="p-0010" num="0009">The aerosol-generating device may be configured to receive an aerosol-generating article. The visual feedback means may surround the aerosol generating article in use.</p>
<p id="p-0011" num="0010">The visual feedback means provided on the proximal end of the aerosol-generating device are readily visible to the user during the user experience. In particular between puffs the user may visually check the indication means without having to turn the aerosol-generating device. In this way handling of the aerosol-generating device is made more convenient.</p>
<p id="p-0012" num="0011">As used herein, an &#x2018;aerosol-generating device&#x2019; relates to a device that interacts with an aerosol-forming substrate to generate an aerosol. The aerosol-forming substrate may be part of an aerosol-generating article. An aerosol-generating device may be a device that interacts with an aerosol-forming substrate of an aerosol-generating article. An aerosol-generating device may be a holder. The aerosol-generating device may be an electrically heated aerosol-generating device. The aerosol-generating device may comprise a housing, electric circuitry, a power supply, a heating chamber and a heating element. The housing may define a cavity that comprises the heating chamber having an open end at the proximal end of the aerosol-generating device, and the heating element. The heating chamber may be configured for insertion of an aerosol-generating article. The heating element may be part of the aerosol-generating article.</p>
<p id="p-0013" num="0012">The aerosol-generating device is preferably a portable or handheld device that is comfortable to hold between the fingers of a single hand. The device may be substantially cylindrical in shape and may have a length of between 30 and 150 millimetres. The maximum diameter of the device is preferably between 5 and 30 millimetres.</p>
<p id="p-0014" num="0013">The housing of the aerosol-generating device may be elongate. The housing may comprise any suitable material or combination of materials. Examples of suitable materials include metals, alloys, plastics or composite materials containing one or more of those materials, or thermoplastics that are suitable for food or pharmaceutical applications, for example polypropylene, polyetheretherketone (PEEK) and polyethylene. Preferably, the material is light and non-brittle.</p>
<p id="p-0015" num="0014">The housing may comprise a mouthpiece. The housing may comprise at least one air inlet. The housing may comprise more than one air inlet. The mouthpiece may comprise at least one air inlet and at least one air outlet. The mouthpiece may comprise more than one air inlet. One or more of the air inlets may reduce the temperature of the aerosol before it is delivered to a user and may reduce the concentration of the aerosol before it is delivered to a user.</p>
<p id="p-0016" num="0015">As used herein, the term &#x2018;mouthpiece&#x2019; refers to a portion of an aerosol-generating device that during a puff is closest to the user's mouth.</p>
<p id="p-0017" num="0016">The aerosol-generating device may include a sensor to activate the aerosol-generating device. The aerosol-generating device may include a user interface to activate the aerosol-generating device, for example a button to initiate heating of the aerosol-generating device or display to indicate a state of the aerosol-generating device or of the aerosol-forming substrate.</p>
<p id="p-0018" num="0017">As used herein, the term &#x2018;user experience&#x2019; refers to the act of consuming an aerosol-generating article. A user experience may include one or more consecutive puffs. The user experience also includes the time period in between puffs.</p>
<p id="p-0019" num="0018">The visual feedback means of the aerosol-generating device may comprise a display device that is based on light emitting diodes (LED), micro LEDs, organic LEDs (OLED) devices or LCD technology. The display device of the visual feedback means may be capable of displaying monochromatic or coloured light. The display device of the visual feedback means may be capable of displaying symbols, signs, letters or numbers. As light source of the aerosol-generating device any known light source with low power consumption may be used. Suitable light sources include light emitting diodes (LED), micro LEDs or organic LEDs (OLED) devices.</p>
<p id="p-0020" num="0019">The visual feedback means may have any suitable shape. The visual feedback means may essentially extend over the complete proximal end face of the aerosol-generating device. The visual feedback means may be ring shaped and may be provided at the proximal end face of the aerosol-generating device.</p>
<p id="p-0021" num="0020">The visual feedback means may comprise segmented display devices. The visual feedback means may comprise a plurality of display devices.</p>
<p id="p-0022" num="0021">The visual feedback means may be arranged at the proximal end of the aerosol-generating device in such way that they may indicate useful information to the user. The information conveyed by the visual feedback means may pertain to the various operation status of the aerosol-generation device. The visual feedback means may also be used to indicate a progress of a specific operation or information regarding the user experience.</p>
<p id="p-0023" num="0022">The visual feedback means may include a display device that is capable of displaying multi-chromatic light. The various colours of this display device can be used to indicate the operation status of the aerosol-generating device. A first colour can be used to indicate readiness of the aerosol-generating device to be used. A second colour can be used to indicate that the aerosol-generating device is in the heat-up phase. A third colour can be used to indicate that the aerosol-generating device is fully heated and ready for consumption. A fourth colour can be used to indicate that the aerosol-generating article is fully consumed.</p>
<p id="p-0024" num="0023">Display devices that are capable of generating multi coloured light may have low power consumption. These display devices may have low power consumption. The addition of a display device with low power consumption advantageously puts only a very small load on the power source of an existing aerosol-generating device, preferably with only very limited effect on the design of the existing power source. This is particularly advantageous for portable devices in which capacity of the power source is limited and excess power consumption is to be avoided.</p>
<p id="p-0025" num="0024">The visual feedback means may also be operated in a way as to indicate the progress of an operation of the aerosol-generating device. Such progress may relate to the progress of the heat-up phase of the aerosol-generating device. The visual feedback means may be used to indicate the elapsed time since the last puff. The visual feedback means may also be used to indicate the elapsed time since the last user experience.</p>
<p id="p-0026" num="0025">In order to indicate a progress of an operation of the aerosol-generating device the display device of the visual feedback means may be operated in pulsating mode, may be operated to change the colour tone or may be operated to change the light intensity. If the visual feedback means comprises a segmented display device or a plurality of individual display devices, segmented lighting of individual sections or display devices may be used to indicate progress of an operation.</p>
<p id="p-0027" num="0026">Displaying a progress of an operation to the user may further enhance communication between the aerosol-generating device and the users. The user obtains additional information on the course of the user experience and overall handling of the aerosol-generating device may be improved.</p>
<p id="p-0028" num="0027">The visual feedback means may also be used in a flashing mode. In flashing mode the visual feedback means are controlled to repeatedly emit a short burst of light. Intensity of the emitted light may be higher than in pulsating mode. A flashing mode may be suitable to indicate a warning to the user. A warning signal may for example be used to indicate overheating of the aerosol-generating device. One or more of the display devices of the visual feedback means may be used in flashing mode.</p>
<p id="p-0029" num="0028">The visual feedback means may also be controlled to display animated fade in and fade out of shapes or symbols.</p>
<p id="p-0030" num="0029">The display device of the visual feedback means may also comprise a multi-pixel display device. Such display devices may be photorealistic displays. Such display devices may be based on Micro LED technology. Due to the limited size of such display, the displayed content is preferably of reduced complexity. For example, such multi pixel display may show a pulsing line, which may be used to indicate the strength of the last puff.</p>
<p id="p-0031" num="0030">The display size of such multi-pixel displays depends on the size of the available surface at the proximal end of the aerosol-generating device. A multi-pixel display device may have a size of up to 1 square centimetre. A multi-pixel display device may have a size of between 0.1 to 0.2 square centimetres. A multi-pixel display device may have a size of about 8.8 millimetres times 1.5 millimetres. Such multi-pixel display device would have a size of about 0.13 square centimetres. Such multi-pixel display device may comprise 600 times 200 pixels with a pixel pitch of about 0.0146 millimetres.</p>
<p id="p-0032" num="0031">The various indication modes may be combined with each other. The user may also be able to customize the indication modes. Customization may be done by connecting the aerosol generating device to a personal computer, a smart phone or any other suitable input device. By customizing the indication means, the user may choose the indication modes of the visual feedback means. For example, the user may select colours, pulsating or flashing frequencies, colour transitions of the display devices. Position, size, colour and brightness of any shapes or symbols displayed by the visual feedback means may be customized. When a multi-pixel display is used, the user may set up the displayed content by use of the input device.</p>
<p id="p-0033" num="0032">The aerosol-generating device may comprise a power source and a control unit. The visual feedback means may be electrically connected to the power source and the control unit of the aerosol-generating device. The control unit may be used to control the overall operation of the aerosol-generating device. The control unit may in particular be used to control the visual feedback means. The control unit may control the visual feedback means based on the status or the progress of operations of the aerosol-generating device. The control unit may adjust pulsating frequency, flashing frequency, colour tone, light intensity of the display device.</p>
<p id="p-0034" num="0033">The control unit may be connected to the heating element of the aerosol-generating device. The control unit may control the visual feedback means based on the status of the heating element of the aerosol-generating device.</p>
<p id="p-0035" num="0034">The aerosol-generating device may include a sensor to activate the aerosol-generating device. The aerosol-generating device may include a user interface to activate the aerosol-generating device, for example a button to initiate heating of the aerosol-generating device or display to indicate a state of the aerosol-generating device or of the aerosol-forming substrate. The control unit may be connected to such button or a corresponding activation sensor. The control unit may control the visual feedback means based on the activation status of the aerosol-generating device.</p>
<p id="p-0036" num="0035">The proximal end of the aerosol-generating device may comprise a proximity sensor. The proximity sensor may be used to detect that the proximal end of the aerosol-generating device is in proximity to the consumer, for example the proximity of the proximal end of the aerosol generating device to the consumer's mouth. The proximity sensor may be in electrical connection with the control unit of the aerosol-generating device. The proximity sensor may be a photocell. The control unit may be configured to control the visual feedback means based on signals received from the proximity sensor.</p>
<p id="p-0037" num="0036">During a puff the proximal end of the aerosol-generating device may be so close to the user's mouth that the user cannot observe the visual feedback means with the eyes. In such situation visibility of the visual feedback means is not crucial anymore, and the control unit may be used to dim or even to switch off the display devices of the visual feedback means. In this way overall energy consumption of the visual feedback means may be reduced.</p>
<p id="p-0038" num="0037">The aerosol-generating device may comprise a light sensor in electrical connection with the control unit of the aerosol-generating device.</p>
<p id="p-0039" num="0038">The light sensor may be used to detect the lighting conditions of the ambient environment. The light sensor may be provided anywhere at the outside of the housing of the aerosol-generating device. The light sensor may be advantageously provided at a location at the aerosol-generating device that is not obstructed by the hand of the user during normal handling of the aerosol-generating device. The light sensor may be in electrical connection with the control unit of the aerosol-generating device. The control unit may be configured to control the visual feedback means based on signals received from the light sensor.</p>
<p id="p-0040" num="0039">At night or in an environment with low lighting conditions, the illumination intensity of the display devices of the visual feedback means may be reduced. Reduction of illumination intensity of the display devices of the visual feedback means may reduce the overall power consumption of the aerosol-generating device.</p>
<p id="p-0041" num="0040">The housing of the aerosol-generating device may comprise a top cover that may be mounted to the proximal end of the housing of the aerosol-generating device. The top cover may have a proximal end face that faces to the user during consumption. The proximal end face of the top cover comprises the above described visual feedback means.</p>
<p id="p-0042" num="0041">The top cover may be detachable from the housing of the aerosol-generating device. The detachable top cover may be essentially ring shaped and may define a central opening. The central opening of the top cover may define the opening of the heating chamber. The detachable top cover may have an outer cross-section that generally corresponds to the outer cross-section of the housing of the aerosol-generating device. The opening of the top cover may a have a circular profile. The opening of the top cover may also have an ornamental, non-circular profile. Preferably, the opening of the top cover is large enough to allow insertion of an aerosol-generating article there through and into the heating chamber of the aerosol-generating device.</p>
<p id="p-0043" num="0042">By providing the visual feedback means on a detachable top cover, the user may be able to customize the aerosol-generating device. The user may purchase top covers having different visual feedback means and may exchange top covers based on personal preference.</p>
<p id="p-0044" num="0043">The detachable top cover may be made from the same material as the housing of the aerosol-generating device. The detachable top cover may be made from a metal or polymeric compound. The detachable top cover may be made from a polyurethane based compound.</p>
<p id="p-0045" num="0044">The detachable top cover may comprise connection means for reversibly connecting the top cover to the housing of the aerosol-generating device. The connection means may be a screw connection, a form fitting connection, or a bayonet type connection. These kinds of connection means do not require application of increased force and can be readily utilised by users.</p>
<p id="p-0046" num="0045">The detachable top cover may comprise electrical connection means facilitating an electrical connection between the visual feedback means and the control unit of the aerosol-generating device. Preferably the detachable top cover is configured such that the electrical connection means are automatically connected when the detachable top cover is correctly mounted to the housing of the aerosol-generating device. For this purpose the detachable top cover may be provided with one or more stoppers that limit rotation of the top cover with respect to the housing.</p>
<p id="p-0047" num="0046">The present invention is also directed to an aerosol-generating system comprising an aerosol-generating device as described above and an aerosol-forming article configured to be inserted into the heating chamber of the aerosol-generating device.</p>
<p id="p-0048" num="0047">The present invention is also directed to a method of operating an aerosol-generating system comprising an aerosol-generating device with a proximity sensor located at its proximal end. The method includes that the control unit of the aerosol-generating device controls the visual feedback means in dependence of the signal received from the proximity sensor.</p>
<p id="p-0049" num="0048">As discussed above, power management of an aerosol-generating device is crucial for optimum and reliable performance. This is especially true for aerosol-generating devices using rechargeable power sources having limited power capacity.</p>
<p id="p-0050" num="0049">The visual feedback means may enhance the user experience, but may at the same time consume electrical power. It is thus desirable that the amount of energy consumed by the visual feedback means is as low as possible. For this purpose, the control unit may be configured to energize certain features of the aerosol-generating device only when these features contribute to enhancing the user experience.</p>
<p id="p-0051" num="0050">During a puff the visual feedback means are out of the view field of the user. Thus, at this moment the visual feedback means do not have to be illuminated, or may at least be illuminated at a lower level, only.</p>

The heating chamber <b>16</b> is configured for insertion of an aerosol-generating article (not shown).</p>
<p id="p-0080" num="0079">At the proximal end <b>18</b> of the aerosol-generating device <b>10</b> there is provided a detachable top cover <b>24</b>. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>1</b>A and <b>1</b>B</figref> show an enlarged plan view and a perspective view of the detachable top cover <b>24</b>. The detachable top cover comprises a generally ring-shaped body <b>26</b>. The body <b>26</b> is made from polyurethane. The body <b>26</b> has a circular outer cross-section that corresponds to the outer cross-section of the housing <b>12</b> of the aerosol-generating device <b>10</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0081" num="0080">At the bottom of the detachable top cover <b>24</b> there is provided a screw connection <b>28</b> via which the top cover <b>24</b> can be reversibly connected to the housing <b>12</b> of the aerosol-generating device <b>10</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0082" num="0081">The top cover <b>24</b> further comprises a visual feedback means <b>30</b>. In the embodiment of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref> the visual feedback means is a single ring shaped display device <b>32</b> that extends over the proximal end face of the top cover <b>24</b>. The ring shaped display device <b>32</b> is configured to emit visible light with variable colour.</p>
<p id="p-0083" num="0082">The control unit is configured to control the display device <b>32</b> in dependence of the status and the progress of specific operations of the aerosol-generating device <b>10</b>. When the user switches on the aerosol-generating device <b>10</b> via power switch <b>14</b>, the display device <b>32</b> is controlled to emit white light to indicate activation of the aerosol-generating device <b>10</b>. During the heat-up phase the display device <b>32</b> emits red light. When the aerosol-generating device <b>10</b> is heated up and is ready for generating an aerosol, the display device <b>32</b> is controlled to emit green light. As an indicator for the end of consumption the display device <b>32</b> is controlled to emit blue light.

<p id="p-0088" num="0087">At the lower lateral sides of the body <b>26</b> of the detachable cover <b>24</b> again a threading <b>28</b> is provided for connecting the top cover <b>24</b> to the open end <b>22</b> of the housing <b>12</b> of the aerosol-generating device <b>10</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0089" num="0088">At the proximal end <b>18</b> of the housing also a further electrical terminal <b>38</b> is provided. When the top cover <b>24</b> is fully mounted to the housing <b>12</b>, an electrical connection is established between the electrical terminal <b>36</b> of the top cover <b>24</b> and the electrical terminal <b>38</b> of the housing <b>12</b>. Over wiring <b>40</b> an electrical connection between the control unit and the display device <b>32</b> is enabled.</p>
<p id="p-0090" num="0089">In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref> various possibilities of how to display information by the visual feedback means <b>30</b> are depicted. In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b>A</figref>, the visual feedback means <b>30</b> comprises a display device <b>32</b> with six segments. The segments are configured as circular segments that form in combination a segmented wheel. When the aerosol-generating device <b>10</b> is deactivated, the display device <b>32</b> is switched off as depicted in the left view of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b>A</figref>. When the aerosol-generating device <b>10</b> is activated, the display device <b>32</b> is switched on and all segments of the segmented wheel are illuminated as depicted in the middle view of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b>A</figref>. When the aerosol-generating device <b>10</b> performs an action, such as heating up, this is indicated by consecutively illuminating the six segments, animating a turning segmented wheel.</p>
<p id="p-0091" num="0090">The visual feedback means <b>30</b> may also be configured for displaying shapes or letters on the display device <b>32</b>. In the left view of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b>B</figref> the display shows a &#x201c;I&#x201d; to indicate that one puff has been completed during the user experience. In the right view of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b>B</figref> the display shows a &#x201c;I&#x201d; and a &#x201c;II&#x201d; to indicate that two puffs have been completed during the user experience. Thus, letters, numbers or other shapes may be used as puff count.</p>
<p id="p-0092" num="0091">In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b></figref> further possibilities of how to display information by the visual feedback means <b>30</b> are depicted. In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b>A</figref>, the visual feedback means <b>30</b> comprises a display device <b>32</b> with four segments. Again only a part of the segments may be lit, so as to indicate progress of an operation.

The visual feedback means <b>30</b> thereby indicate that 25 percent and 50 percent of an operation such as heating-up the aerosol-generating device <b>10</b> is completed.</p>
<p id="p-0093" num="0092">In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b>B</figref> a further embodiment of the present invention is depicted. The visual feedback means <b>30</b> comprise five photorealistic display devices <b>32</b> that are each based on micro LED technology. The display devices <b>32</b> have display sections that are distributed over the circumference of the ring shaped end face of the aerosol-generating device <b>10</b>. The display devices <b>32</b> are capable of displaying more complex patterns. In the depicted embodiment the display devices <b>32</b> show each a pulsing line, to indicate the strength of the previous puff.</p>
