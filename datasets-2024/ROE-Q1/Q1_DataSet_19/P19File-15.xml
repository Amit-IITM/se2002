<heading id="h-0001" level="1">TECHNICAL FIELD</heading>
<p id="p-0002" num="0001">The present subject matter, in general, relates to an automatically operated cooking apparatus and in particular, relates to a disc-shaped cooking apparatus for automatic dispensing, spreading and cooking of raw ingredients comprising semi-solid liquid substance, and serving the food item thus prepared.</p>
<heading id="h-0002" level="1">BACKGROUND</heading>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">Cooking of food items, especially those prepared from semi-solid liquid raw ingredients, is generally performed manually due to complex steps and requirement of controlled parameters, such as temperature, thickness of food products, ingredient levels, uniform mixing and spreading etc. Conventional cooking apparatuses are customarily available to perform one step of multi-level steps required for food preparation at any given time. Performing of several steps of cooking simultaneously along with controlling of afore-mentioned parameters requires an arduous labor and is relatively quiet time consuming. Some conventional apparatuses are required to be manually tilted in varying positions for facilitating collection and spreading of raw material onto the heating surface. Even after all cooking steps are complete, serving of cooked food item requires precise handling by the user. In conventional apparatuses, cooked food item has to be manually lifted off the cooking surface and served on a plate. This requires the user to carefully handle the cooked food item while transferring it to a serving dish. Some conventional apparatuses can also be tilted manually for transferring the cooked food item onto the serving dish. This requires the user to handle the cooking apparatus with great caution. There is a risk of injury to the user if the hot surface of the apparatus comes in direct contact with the user. In some conventional apparatuses, if cooked food item is not removed from the cooking surface in a timely manner and the food item is subjected to heat longer than necessary, there is a risk of burning the food item.</p>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">Therefore, a great amount of human intervention is required even for cooking a food item in an automatic cooking apparatus known in the art. Further, uneven application of raw ingredients on a heating surface results in uneven thickness and roast levels of the final food item, and in irregular control of degree of heat applied to the food item, thereby affecting the flavor and texture characteristics of the cooked food item.</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">In the case of food products such as dosa, crepes, pancakes etc., the temperature of a cooking surface plays a vital role when the batter is spread over said surface. If the cooking surface is too hot, the raw material sticks to the surface as soon as said it comes in contact with the cooking surface. This makes the process of spreading of batter very difficult and may result in a thicker final food product. Also, there are chances that the finally cooked food product does not come off the surface in a clean manner from the cooking surface. In order to mitigate these problems, the cooking surface of the conventional apparatus is generally greased with oil or a cooking spray before dispensing a raw material or batter. However, this renders the food item unhealthy.</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">Moreover, during operation, the heated cooking surface of a conventional cooking apparatus remains unused during the interval when the cooked food item has been removed from the surface, but next batch of raw material is yet to be dispensed and spread on the surface. This makes the cooking process energy inefficient and time consuming.</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">In some conventional apparatuses, the cooking components are fixed permanently and cannot be removed for cleaning. This makes the cleaning of components cumbersome.</p>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">Fully automatic cooking apparatuses which perform more than one step of cooking a food item are also known. However, such cooking apparatuses are restricted to cooking only one type of food item or different food items of same category. Even for a single type of food item preparation, separate components/sub-assemblies are employed by such fully automatic apparatuses for performing different cooking steps. Having large number of components/sub-assemblies for separate cooking steps puts a question mark on the reliability of such apparatuses. Further, large number of moving parts add to the challenges of reduced working life cycle and efficiency of such fully automatic cooking apparatuses. Moreover, sound and vibrations due to multiple moving parts play quiet a decisive role in selection of a cooking apparatus by customers.</p>
<p id="p-0009" num="0008">Therefore, there is a well felt need for a fully automatic cooking apparatus that is simple and economical and at the same time is able to automatically perform complex cooking techniques of different type of food items as well as food items of different categories in an efficient and reliable manner without compromising its safety and stability. Further, it is desired to provide an automatic cooking apparatus and method which is capable of achieving uniform dispensing and controlling of cooking substance in an easy, controlled and cost-effective manner with minimum moving components.</p>

In the manual mode, the cooking apparatus <b>100</b> can be used as a conventional hot plate and the horizontally placed front heater plate <b>102</b><i>a </i>can be used as a cooking surface for cooking food items.</p>
<p id="p-0081" num="0080">The working of the disc-shaped automatic cooking apparatus of the present invention will be described with reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>7</b>A to <b>13</b>C</figref>, which illustrate various working positions of the disc-shaped automatic cooking apparatus <b>100</b> in accordance with one embodiment of the present subject matter.</p>
<p id="p-0082" num="0081">In the home position, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>7</b>A and <b>7</b>B</figref>, the cooking apparatus <b>100</b> is in the ready state or rest position. the elongated blade <b>106</b> is cleaned and fitted on the heater plate assembly <b>102</b>. A semi-solid liquid substance or batter is filled into the feeder tank <b>112</b> and the feeder tank <b>112</b> is fitted in the proximity of cooking surface the heater plate assembly <b>102</b>. In an alternate embodiment, the feeder tank <b>112</b> can be first fitted on the heater plate assembly <b>102</b> and then filled with batter. When the apparatus <b>100</b> is powered on and start button pressed, the apparatus <b>100</b> checks movement of the heater plate assembly <b>102</b> to make it complete position ready. Now heaters of the electrical heating assembly are turn ON. A user can select the number of food items to be cooked in the apparatus.

In an embodiment, a thickness selection control is provided in the control panel <b>124</b> for selecting speed of the heater plate drive motor <b>144</b>. In another embodiment, the thickness selection control may be replaced with a thickness selection knob. The thickness of the desired food item can also be adjusted by varying the tilting position of the heater plate assembly <b>102</b>. Similarly, the roast level of the desired food item can be selected by varying the cooking time by selecting the cooking time control in the control panel <b>124</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0083" num="0082">Once the temperature of the front heater plate <b>102</b><i>a </i>reaches a pre-determined value, the feeder drive assembly <b>118</b> tilts or swivels the feeder tank <b>112</b> towards the cooking surface of the front heater plate <b>102</b><i>a</i>, as shown by arrow Y in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>7</b>B</figref>, such that the mouth opening <b>116</b> of the feeder tank <b>112</b> is positioned so as to dispense the batter through the feeder tank mouth opening <b>116</b> on the cooking surface of the front heater plate <b>102</b><i>a</i>. Simultaneously, the plate drive motor rotates the front heater plate <b>102</b><i>a </i>in the clockwise direction, as shown by arrow X in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>7</b>A</figref>, in an embodiment.</p>
<p id="p-0084" num="0083">The tilted or dispensing position of the feeder tank <b>112</b> is depicted in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>8</b>A and <b>8</b>B</figref>. In this position, the front heater plate <b>102</b><i>a </i>starts to rotate in clockwise direction X. The rotation of the front heater plate <b>102</b><i>a </i>enables uniform dispensing or printing of batter from the feeder tank <b>112</b> over the cooking surface of the front heater plate <b>102</b><i>a</i>. Hence, this position can also be referred to as printing start position. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>9</b>A and <b>9</b>B</figref> depict an intermediary printing position of the front heater plate <b>102</b><i>a </i>when the front heater plate <b>102</b><i>a </i>has completed about half of its rotation. During rotation of the front heater plate <b>102</b><i>a </i>from the printing start position as depicted in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>8</b>A and <b>8</b>B</figref> to the intermediary printing position as depicted in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>9</b>A and <b>9</b>B</figref>, the batter is printed on the cooking surface of the front heater plate <b>102</b><i>a</i>. The printed batter on the front heater plate <b>102</b><i>a </i>is marked as <b>156</b> in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>9</b>A</figref>. In the intermediary printing position, the feeder tank <b>112</b> remains in the dispensing position. Once the required amount of batter is printed on the front heater plate <b>102</b><i>a</i>, the feeder tank <b>112</b> is swiveled/tilted back in the ready/home position in the direction of arrow Y&#x2032;, as depicted in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>9</b>B</figref>, by the feeder drive assembly <b>118</b>. When the feeder tank <b>112</b> is swiveled/tilted based in the ready/home position, the batter that is not dispensed on the front heater plate <b>102</b><i>a </i>is collected back and stored in feeder tank <b>112</b> for next printing operation.</p>
<p id="p-0085" num="0084">In the present embodiment, the tilting back of the feeder tank <b>112</b> to its ready/home position starts when the front heater plate <b>102</b><i>a </i>is rotated by about 270 degrees. In this position, the batter <b>156</b> is printed on about 3/4th surface of the front heater plate <b>102</b><i>a </i>as can be seen in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>10</b>A</figref>. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>10</b>A and <b>10</b>B</figref> depict the printing end position of the front heater plate <b>102</b><i>a</i>. In this position, rotation of the front heater plate <b>102</b><i>a </i>is stopped, and the batter <b>156</b> printed on the front heater plate <b>102</b><i>a </i>is allowed to cook at a pre-determined temperature for a pre-determined time duration. After the pre-determined time duration is over, the front heater plate <b>102</b><i>a </i>starts to rotate again in the same direction, as shown by arrow X in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>10</b>A</figref>. The further rotation of the front heater plate <b>102</b><i>a </i>enables automatic removal or peeling of the cooked food item <b>156</b>&#x2032; from the front heater plate <b>102</b><i>a </i>by the elongated blade <b>106</b>, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>11</b>A and <b>11</b>B</figref>. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>11</b>A and <b>11</b>B</figref> depict the cooked product removal position of the front heater plate <b>102</b><i>a</i>. During this step of peeling of the cooked food item, the feeder tank <b>112</b> again flips towards the cooking surface of the front heater plate <b>102</b><i>a </i>to simultaneously print the batter <b>156</b> on the front heater plate <b>102</b><i>a </i>for cooking a second food item, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>12</b>A and <b>12</b>B</figref>. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>12</b>A and <b>12</b>B</figref> depict the cooked product removal and next product printing position of the front heater plate <b>102</b><i>a</i>. Hence, removal of previous cooked food item <b>156</b>&#x2032; and printing of new batter <b>156</b> on the front heater plate <b>102</b><i>a </i>takes place simultaneously. After printing of the second food item is finished, the feeder tank <b>112</b> again flips back to its home position. The process is repeated simultaneously up to the selected quantity of food items are cooked. For the final food item, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>13</b>A and <b>13</b>B</figref>, the feeder tank <b>112</b> does not flip towards the front heater plate <b>102</b><i>a</i>, however, the final cooked food item <b>156</b>&#x2032; is peeled by the elongated blade <b>106</b>, thereby performing only the scrapping operation. Hence, removal of the final cooked food item <b>156</b>&#x2032; alone is performed by the elongated blade <b>106</b> in this step without printing of batter. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>13</b>A and <b>13</b>B</figref> depict the final cooked food item <b>156</b>&#x2032; removal position of the front heater plate <b>102</b><i>a</i>. The cooked food item <b>156</b>&#x2032; after removal from the front heater plate <b>102</b><i>a </i>is collected in the tray <b>128</b>. As can be seen in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>13</b>A, <b>13</b>B and <b>13</b>C</figref>, the cooked food item <b>156</b>&#x2032; removed from the front heater plate <b>102</b><i>a </i>has a conical shape. After completion of the above process, the elongated blade <b>106</b> and the feeder tank <b>112</b> can be removed from the cooking apparatus <b>100</b> for cleaning and maintenance purposes. One of the features of the removable feeder tank is that after all food items are prepared, the feeder tank <b>112</b> containing the remaining batter can be stored in refrigerator.</p>
<p id="p-0086" num="0085">In an embodiment, the thickness of the cooked food item can be adjusted by any one or combination of steps comprising varying the viscosity of semi-solid liquid substance or batter, varying the angle of the heater plate assembly <b>102</b> with respect to the vertical plane, and varying the rotation speed of the front heater plate <b>102</b><i>a</i>. In an embodiment, viscosity of the semi-solid liquid substance or batter can be adjusted manually by the user. The angle of the heater plate assembly <b>102</b> with respect to the vertical plane can be adjusted by using the adjustable stand <b>108</b>. In a preferred embodiment, the angle of the heater plate assembly <b>102</b> can be adjusted between 90&#xb0;-70&#xb0; with respect to the vertical plan.
