The e-cigarette includes an upper housing, a lower housing, a gel container, a press and reset mechanism, and an aerosol channel. The gelled e-liquid is supplied quantitatively to a heating chamber by manually pressing the press and reset mechanism. The user can adjust the time interval between pressing and releasing the press and reset mechanism according to the needs of the user for each inhalation by adjusting the length of the gelled e-liquid stick supplied to the heating chamber. Besides, a holder is provided therein with heating plates at different positions, and the holder also serves as a heating element. The design avoids the need to provide the heating element and the heating chamber separately, which reduces the volume of the smoking device.</p>

<heading level="1" id="h-0002">TECHNICAL FIELD</heading>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">The present disclosure belongs to the field of electronic cigarettes (e-cigarettes) and in particular to an e-cigarette capable of holding, heating, and quantitatively supplying a gelled electronic liquid (e-liquid).</p>
<heading level="1" id="h-0003">BACKGROUND</heading>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">The demand by people for the reduction of harmful effects from cigarettes has promoted the birth and rapid development of e-cigarettes. Nicotine and flavorings are dissolved in glycerol, propylene glycol, or other polyols to make the e-liquid, which serves as the aerosol-producing material of the e-cigarette. The e-liquid is filled into a smoking device and conveyed to an atomizer in the smoking device through e-liquid guide cotton or other guide elements. The e-liquid in the atomizer is heated by an electric heating element to atomize and form an aerosol similar to that of conventional cigarettes for the user to inhale.</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">However, in actual assembly, the e-liquid container, the e-liquid guide cotton, and the electric heating element of the smoking device may have poor sealing performance due to their inconsistent sizes. In addition, during subsequent storage, transportation, and use, the sealing performance may be impaired due to vibration and collision. As a result, the e-liquid may leak, thereby affecting the user&#x2019;s experience. In order to solve the leakage problem, it has been proposed to replace the e-liquid with a gelled e-liquid as the aerosol-producing material. According to reports, a gelling agent is often used to make the e-liquid solidify into gel (a jelly or a solid). The gelling agent usually has the property of thermo-reversible phase transition, which makes the e-liquid solidify into the gel at a low temperature, liquefied after being heated, and solidified into the gel again after being cooled.</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">However, new problems arise in the practical use of the gelled e-liquid. If only a small amount of gelled e-liquid pieces are used each time and completely atomized after being heated once, the aerosol produced can only provide several inhalations (such as 7 or 8 inhalations) for the user to continuously take. This cannot meet the user&#x2019;s long-term demand for smoking at any time. Generally, the amount of the e-liquid stored in the e-cigarette must be enough for the user to take hundreds to thousands of inhalations by heating the e-liquid at any time. In addition, in the case of the gelled e-liquid, each inhalation needs a new gelled e-liquid piece, which is troublesome and violates the original intention of using the gelled e-liquid to prevent leakage. When a large gelled e-liquid piece is used, although it is enough for the user to take hundreds to thousands of inhalations after being completely atomized, the following problems will arise.</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">1) To continuously supply the gelled e-liquid to the heating element as conventional e-cigarettes do, the large gelled e-liquid piece must be heated completely or mostly each time to provide enough e-liquid. Since it is not known in advance how many inhalations the user will take, the amount of the e-liquid stored must at least exceed that required by the user to take 7 or 8 inhalations in a round. After the user stops one round of inhalation, the remaining e-liquid is solidified back to the gelled state and is heated and liquefied again in the next round of inhalation. The repeated heating-cooling (liquefaction-solidification) process consumes the electric energy of the electric heating element and makes the user feel the delay of the first inhalation. The first inhalation requires a large amount of e-liquid to be heated and liquefied to supply enough e-liquid to the heating element through the e-liquid guide cotton. Some chemical substances such as flavorings in the e-liquid may be pyrolyzed due to repeated heating, thereby resulting in a peculiar smell.</p>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">2) Although there are many gelling agents that can gel the e-liquid, there are not many gelling agents with the property of thermo-reversible phase transition, which severely narrows the selection materials for gelling agents.</p>
<p id="p-0009" num="0008">3) If only the desired amount, not all of the gelled e-liquid, is heated and liquefied each time, the gelled e-liquid must be continuously and quantitatively supplied to the heating element. That is, a fixed amount of gelled e-liquid must be supplied to the heating element after the same amount of gelled e-liquid is heated and atomized. However, this is a problem. An e-liquid can be supplied continuously due to its fluidity, but the gelled e-liquid is a jelly or a solid and is not flowable. Therefore, for the gelled e-liquid, how to be supplied quantitatively and continuously has become a big issue. If the gelled e-liquid is supplied to the heating element through the e-liquid guide cotton after being heated and liquefied, only the gelled e-liquid close to the heating element can be liquefied. The gelled e-liquid far away from the heating element cannot be heated and liquefied, so it cannot be supplied to the heating element for atomization, which may cause inhalation interruption and seriously affect the user&#x2019;s experience. 4) The gelled e-liquid may also be dried or oxidized during long-term storage, which will shorten its shelf life and affect inhalation quality. In addition, if the gelling agent used is not vapourable, it will remain in the smoking device after the e-liquid is heated and atomized, thereby contaminating the internal part of the smoking device.</p>

<p id="p-0036" num="0035">The lower end of the holder <b>2</b>-<b>2</b> is close to the lower end of the smoking device. Even if the gelled e-liquid stick <b>8</b> falls to the bottommost part of the smoking device, the length of the gelled e-liquid stick exposed by the holder <b>2</b>-<b>2</b> is very small, thereby avoiding waste of the gelled e-liquid stick <b>8</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0037" num="0036">In the present disclosure, when one gelled e-liquid stick <b>8</b> is used up and a new one needs to be inserted, the new gelled e-liquid stick can be inserted by the following two methods according to the specific structure of the e-cigarette: 
<ul id="ul0001" list-style="none">
<li id="ul0001-0001" num="0037">method 1: disassembling the upper section <b>1</b>-<b>1</b> from the lower section <b>1</b>-<b>2</b>, disassembling the mouthpiece <b>7</b> from the gel container <b>2</b>, putting the new gelled e-liquid stick <b>8</b> into the gel container <b>2</b> from the upper end of the gel container, and assembling the mouthpiece <b>7</b> and the upper section <b>1</b>-<b>1</b> as designed; and</li>
<li id="ul0001-0002" num="0038">method <b>2</b>: disassembling the lower housing <b>5</b> from the upper housing <b>1</b>, pressing the holder <b>2</b>-<b>2</b> to release it, and inserting a new gelled e-liquid stick <b>8</b> from the lower end of the holder <b>2</b>-<b>2</b>.</li>
</ul>
</p>
<p id="p-0038" num="0039">In the present disclosure, in an axial direction of the e-cigarette, an end of the e-cigarette close to the lip is denoted as an &#x201c;upper end&#x201d;, and an end thereof far away from the lip is denoted as a &#x201c;lower end&#x201d; or &#x201c;bottom end&#x201d;.</p>
<p id="p-0039" num="0040">A second aspect of the present disclosure provides a method of using the e-cigarette described in the first aspect. The method includes pressing the press and reset mechanism to drive the gel container <b>2</b> to move downward, such that the gradual extension structure is released from the stop ring <b>1</b>-<b>4</b> and a part of the gelled e-liquid stick <b>8</b> held by the gradual extension structure falls to a lower end of the holder <b>2</b>-<b>2</b>; releasing the press and reset mechanism, such that the press and reset mechanism is reset to drive the gel container <b>2</b> to move upward, where when the holder <b>2</b>-<b>2</b> moves upward and is in contact with the stop ring <b>1</b>-<b>4</b>, the holder tightens to hold the gelled e-liquid stick <b>8</b>; and starting a heating program of the smoking device, such that the holder <b>2</b>-<b>2</b> heats the gelled e-liquid stick <b>8</b> therein, and the aerosol produced by the gelled e-liquid stick <b>8</b> enters the aerosol channel <b>6</b> for a user to inhale.</p>
<p id="p-0040" num="0041">All the heating plates <b>2</b>-<b>2</b>-<b>2</b> can be heated at the same time or the heating process can be started step by step. For example, the heating plate <b>2</b>-<b>2</b>-<b>2</b> on the lower end surface of each of the holding portions <b>2</b>-<b>2</b>-<b>1</b> is first started, and then the heating plate <b>2</b>-<b>2</b>-<b>2</b> provided on the inner wall of the holder <b>2</b>-<b>2</b> is started to heat the gelled e-liquid stick <b>8</b> in sections.</p>
<p id="p-0041" num="0042">The heating plate <b>2</b>-<b>2</b>-<b>2</b> on the lower end surface of each of the holding portions <b>2</b>-<b>2</b>-<b>1</b> can also be started separately to heat the gelled e-liquid stick <b>8</b> in sections.</p>
<p id="p-0042" num="0043">In a preferred technical solution, another e-cigarette of the present disclosure has the following structure.</p>
<p id="p-0043" num="0044">The e-cigarette includes an upper housing <b>1</b>, a lower housing <b>5</b>, a gel container <b>2</b>, a press and reset mechanism, and an aerosol channel <b>6</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0044" num="0045">An inner wall of the upper housing <b>1</b> has an upper end provided with a limit ring <b>1</b>-<b>3</b> and a lower end provided with a stop ring <b>1</b>-<b>4</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0045" num="0046">The gel container <b>2</b> is a hollow cylinder, which has a lower end provided with a hollow holder <b>2</b>-<b>2</b>, and the holder <b>2</b>-<b>2</b> is provided with a gradual extension structure at a connecting position between the holder <b>2</b>-<b>2</b> and the gel container <b>2</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0046" num="0047">The side wall of the holder <b>2</b>-<b>2</b> is longitudinally provided with multiple gaps, which divide the side wall of the holder <b>2</b>-<b>2</b> into multiple holding portions <b>2</b>-<b>2</b>-<b>1</b>. The holding portions each are provided with multiple longitudinally spaced heating plates <b>2</b>-<b>2</b>-<b>2</b>. The gradual extension structure of the holder <b>2</b>-<b>2</b> is in movable contact with the stop ring <b>1</b>-<b>4</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0047" num="0048">The press and reset mechanism is connected to the gel container <b>2</b> and partially protrudes outside the upper housing <b>1</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0048" num="0049">The heating plates <b>2</b>-<b>2</b>-<b>2</b> protrude radially from an inner wall of the holding portion <b>2</b>-<b>2</b>-<b>1</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0049" num="0050">A lower end surface of the heating plate <b>2</b>-<b>2</b>-<b>2</b> is provided with a heating coating or printed with a heating track. The heating plate <b>2</b>-<b>2</b>-<b>2</b> is connected to the control board and the battery through a heating pin. The lower end surface of the heating plate <b>2</b>-<b>2</b>-<b>2</b> is an end surface facing the central axis of the e-cigarette.</p>
<p id="p-0050" num="0051">The lower end surface of the heating plate <b>2</b>-<b>2</b>-<b>2</b> is in contact with the gelled e-liquid stick <b>8</b>, which plays the role of holding and heating.</p>
<p id="p-0051" num="0052">There may be 2 to 6 holding portions <b>2</b>-<b>2</b>-<b>1</b> and 2 to 6 heating plates <b>2</b>-<b>2</b>-<b>2</b> on each of the holding portions <b>2</b>-<b>2</b>-<b>1</b>, and the heating plates <b>2</b>-<b>2</b>-<b>2</b> on each of the holding portions <b>2</b>-<b>2</b>-<b>1</b> do not have contact with each other.</p>
<p id="p-0052" num="0053">A method of using the e-cigarette includes pressing the press and reset mechanism to drive the gel container <b>2</b> to move downward, such that the gradual extension structure is released from the stop ring <b>1</b>-<b>4</b>, the holder <b>2</b>-<b>2</b> is released, and a part of the gelled e-liquid stick <b>8</b> held by the gradual extension structure falls to a lower end of the holder <b>2</b>-<b>2</b>; releasing the press and reset mechanism, such that the press and reset mechanism is reset to drive the gel container <b>2</b> to move upward, where when the holder <b>2</b>-<b>2</b> moves upward and is in contact with the stop ring <b>1</b>-<b>4</b>, the holder tightens to hold the gelled e-liquid stick <b>8</b>; and starting a heating program of the smoking device, such that the holder <b>2</b>-<b>2</b> heats the gelled e-liquid stick <b>8</b> therein, and the aerosol produced by the gelled e-liquid stick <b>8</b> enters the aerosol channel <b>6</b> for a user to inhale.</p>
<p id="p-0053" num="0054">All the heating plates <b>2</b>-<b>2</b>-<b>2</b> can be heated at the same time or the heating process can be started step by step. For example, the heating plates <b>2</b>-<b>2</b>-<b>2</b> are started in sequence from the lower end away from the lip to the end close to the lip to heat the gelled e-liquid stick <b>8</b> in sections.</p>
<p id="p-0054" num="0055">In this way, the gelled e-liquid stick falling in the inner space and lower end surface of the holder <b>2</b>-<b>2</b> after one press can be atomized by heating in sections. For example, four heating plates <b>2</b>-<b>2</b>-<b>2</b> at the lowermost end away from the lip are first started for the user to take two inhalations. After the user completes the two inhalations, the four lowermost heating plates are stopped, and four heating plates <b>2</b>-<b>2</b>-<b>2</b> adjacent to the four lowermost heating plates are started in sequence for the user to take two inhalations. After the user completes the two inhalations, the four heating plates adjacent to the four lowermost heating plates are stopped, and four other heating plates adjacent are started. Thus, the gelled e-liquid stick <b>8</b> can be heated and atomized consecutively, which saves electric energy and ensures a consistent amount of aerosol for each inhalation.</p>
<p id="p-0055" num="0056">If the gel in the whole heating chamber is heated directly, for example, to allow the user to take <b>8</b> inhalations, the following problems will occur. Because of the large contact area between the gelled e-liquid stick and the heating element at the beginning, the atomization efficiency is high, and the amount of the aerosol for the first few inhalations is large. When the gelled e-liquid stick is partially liquefied, the contact area between the gelled e-liquid stick and the heating element decreases, and the atomization efficiency decreases, so the amount of the aerosol for the inhalations taken behind is insufficient.</p>
<p id="p-0056" num="0057">The above technical solutions can be combined arbitrarily in case of no conflict.</p>
<p id="p-0057" num="0058">The present disclosure has the following beneficial effects.</p>
<p id="p-0058" num="0059">1. In the present disclosure, the gelled e-liquid is supplied quantitatively to the heating chamber by manually pressing the press and reset mechanism. The user can adjust the time interval between pressing and releasing the press and reset mechanism according to the needs of the user for each inhalation by adjusting the length of the gelled e-liquid stick supplied to the heating chamber. Besides, the holder <b>2</b>-<b>2</b> is provided with the heating plates <b>2</b>-<b>2</b>-<b>2</b>, and the holder <b>2</b>-<b>2</b> also serves as the heating element. The design avoids the need to provide the heating element and the heating chamber separately, which reduces the volume of the smoking device.</p>
<p id="p-0059" num="0060">2. The whole gelled e-liquid stick is provided in the gel container, which avoids the need for a repeated liquefaction-solidification process, so the gelled e-liquid stick used may not have the property of thermo-reversible solid-liquid phase transition. This design greatly expands the selection of materials for the gelling agent, such that some gelling agents that do not have the property of thermo-reversible solid-liquid phase transition can also be used.</p>
<p id="p-0060" num="0061">3. As the gelled e-liquid stick only goes through one heating process, it does not need to go through the repeated liquefaction-solidification process. The electric energy of the heating element is maximized, and the atomization is almost not delayed, which improves the user&#x2019;s experience. In addition, the design avoids the chemical change of chemical substances in the gelled e-liquid stick due to repeated heating to reduce the possibility of a peculiar smell.</p>
<p id="p-0061" num="0062">4. In the preferred technical solution, the upper housing <b>1</b> and the lower housing <b>5</b> are detachably or rotatably connected to facilitate the loading of the gelled e-liquid stick and cleaning of the powder residue left after the heating of gelled e-liquid stick.</p>
<p id="p-0062" num="0063">5. In the preferred technical solution, the upper housing <b>1</b> is divided into the upper section <b>1</b>-<b>1</b> and the lower section <b>1</b>-<b>2</b> that are detachably connected. To load the gelled e-liquid stick, it is only necessary to disassemble the upper section <b>1</b>-<b>1</b> from the lower section <b>1</b>-<b>2</b> and put the gelled e-liquid stick into the gel container, which is convenient for operation.</p>
<p id="p-0063" num="0064">6. In the preferred technical solution, multiple heating plates <b>2</b>-<b>2</b>-<b>2</b> are spaced in the holder <b>2</b>-<b>2</b>. The multiple heating plates <b>2</b>-<b>2</b>-<b>2</b> are spaced in the axial direction of the e-cigarette, so the heating plates <b>2</b>-<b>2</b>-<b>2</b> can be started from the end far away from the lip to the end close to the lip to heat the gelled e-liquid stick <b>8</b> in sections. The design saves electric energy and ensures that the amount of the aerosol for each inhalation is consistent, avoiding the situation that the amount of the aerosol is large at the beginning and insufficient subsequently.</p>
