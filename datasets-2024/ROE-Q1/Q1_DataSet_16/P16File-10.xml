<heading level="1" id="h-0005">1 Field of the Invention</heading>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">This invention relates to the field of clothing. More specifically, the invention comprises a tactile touchscreen selector allowing a user to interact with a touchscreen device while wearing protecting clothing - such as gloves.</p>
<heading level="1" id="h-0006">2 Description of the Related Art</heading>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">Protective clothing is used in a wide variety of fields. Flight gloves used by military pilots provide a good example. Such gloves provide protection against cold conditions and &#x2014;perhaps most significantly &#x2014; fire. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref> provides a perspective view of a prior art glove <b>10</b>. Gloves are made in many different ways. A common approach is to use a flat back trank joined to a flat palm trank via a ribbon of interconnecting material known as a fourchette. In the example of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>, back trank <b>14</b> is made of NOMEX (a meta-aramid polymer). NOMEX is often used because it combines flexibility and breathability with flame resistance.</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">Fourchette <b>20</b> is also made of NOMEX, but with an additional elasticizing element in the weave so that a higher degree of stretching is created. The version shown has a posterior extended fourchette <b>22</b>. This allows increased radial elasticity for the glove. Thumb <b>24</b> is a separate component that is also stitched to fourchette <b>20</b>. Cuff cinch <b>12</b> has a hook-and-loop tab that allows the cuff to be tightened.</p>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">The fourchette and trank materials often have different desired characteristics. For example, the trank material <b>16</b> might be selected primarily for breathability, whereas the fourchette material <b>18</b> might be selected primarily for abrasion resistance. The present invention can be utilized with virtually any combination.</p>
<p id="p-0009" num="0008"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref> shows the same glove from the palm side. Palm trank <b>26</b> includes a high-friction coating. In this example a layer of rubber is bonded to a layer of NOMEX. The high-friction coating enhances grip. The reader in this view may see how fourchette <b>20</b> wraps around the four fingers and joins the back trank to the palm trank.</p>
<p id="p-0010" num="0009">Many user interfaces now include capacitive touch screens. These screens allow a user to move a cursor by touching the screen with a fingertip and then moving the fingertip across the screen. Selections are made by pressing or tapping the finger against the screen. The detection of a selection or &#x201c;pick&#x201d; may be done by a resistive layer in the touchscreen. The resistive layer actually deforms to create a bridge circuit in the area of the pick. In more recent years, a user selection is often detected using raw position data fed through a software algorithm. The software actually detects the pick when a short-duration contact is detected over an icon display (as one example). In other cases a pick is detected when the pressing action broadens the contact point and this produces a change in the electrostatic field of a transparent conductor which is sensed and interpreted as a user &#x201c;button push&#x201d; or &#x201c;pick&#x201d; by the software associated with the touch screen.</p>
<p id="p-0011" num="0010">The use of capacitive touch screen devices is impaired by the wearing of fabric gloves, since the fabric provides an insulating layer between the user&#x2019;s skin and the screen. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref> shows a prior art solution to this problem. Conductive patch <b>28</b> is included in the fourchette proximate the user&#x2019;s fingertip. This conductive patch is created by including a conducting fiber in the fabric weave. A separate patch of conductive cloth is often used (rather than including a conductive fiber in the entire glove) because the inclusion of the conductive fiber significantly increases the fabric cost.</p>
<p id="p-0012" num="0011">The use of conductive patch <b>28</b> allows the user to move a cursor on a touchscreen device and also allows the user to make a selection by pressing (a software-registered &#x201c;pick&#x201d;). However, the moving and selection actions are quite clumsy compared to the user&#x2019;s bare fingertip. The lack of tactile feedback makes it difficult for the use to know how hard he or she is pressing. A light amount of pressure may cause the fabric of conductive patch <b>28</b> to flatten against the screen - causing the interface device to register a &#x201c;pick&#x201d; when no pick was intended. It is difficult for the user to accurately feel the pressure as he or she moves a finger around on the screen. The present invention provides a tactile feedback device that addresses this problem.</p>
<heading level="1" id="h-0007">BRIEF SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0013" num="0012">The present invention comprises a selector configured to provide tactile feedback to the user. The selector can be incorporated into the fingertip of a glove, or many other suitable locations. Different size selectors can be provided for different application. Arrays of multiple selectors can also be provided.</p>
<p id="p-0014" num="0013">An embodiment of the inventive device includes a central plunger lying behind a conductive covering. A tactile surface is provided on the rear of the plunger. A compressive element is positioned to urge the plunger toward the conductive covering. When a user presses the selector against a touchscreen, the plunger is pushed away from the touchscreen and the tactile surface on the plunger presses against the user. The pressing of the tactile surface provides feedback to the user.</p>

<heading level="1" id="h-0009">DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0024" num="0022"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref> shows glove <b>52</b> incorporating the present invention. Tactile touchscreen selector <b>32</b> is added in fingertip region <b>30</b>. The inventive tactile touchscreen selector can be added in any desired region, but the device will most often be placed in an area that is commonly used for interacting with a touchscreen device. Hence, in the version shown, the selector is placed near the tip of the index finger.</p>
<p id="p-0025" num="0023"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>4</b> and <b>5</b></figref> provide a sectional view through an embodiment of the tactile touchscreen selector. In his example tactile touchscreen selector <b>32</b> is placed in a hole through fourchette <b>20</b> - proximate the location of fingertip <b>42</b>. Conductive mesh <b>34</b> is a flexible layer including conductive fibers. The mesh has a dome shape, with the tip <b>60</b> of the dome being on the right side of the view. Components of the assembly will be referred to as increasingly distal from this tip as one proceeds to the left in the orientation of the view. Thus, proximal in this context will mean further to the right and distal will mean further to the left.</p>
<p id="p-0026" num="0024">The mesh has low electrical resistance across its thickness. Plunger <b>36</b> rests immediately behind the conductive mesh. An expanded section of the plunger contacts the back surface of conductive mesh <b>36</b>. The body of the plunder assumes the form of a cylinder in this example. The portion of the plunger most distal to conductive mesh <b>34</b> is tactile surface <b>44</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0027" num="0025">The components are contained within housing <b>40</b>. Overhanging portion <b>58</b> of housing <b>40</b> is shown in its final state - after it has been swaged over base <b>46</b>. When the device is originally being assembled, overhanging portion <b>58</b> is straight. This allows conductive mesh <b>34</b> to be placed inside the housing, followed by plunger <b>36</b>, resilient collar <b>38</b>, and finally base <b>46</b>. Once the components are assembled, they are placed in a holding fixture and overhanging portion <b>58</b> of housing <b>40</b> is swaged over the distal portion of base <b>46</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0028" num="0026">With the swaging operation, the outer perimeter of conductive mesh <b>34</b> is pinched between the proximal portion of housing <b>40</b> and the proximal portion of base <b>46</b>. This action secures the conductive mesh in place. Base <b>46</b> is &#x201c;captured&#x201d; in position by the swaging operation that creates overhanging portion <b>58</b>. Resilient collar <b>38</b> in this example is a compressible foam. It is somewhat compressed by the swaging operation so that conductive mesh <b>34</b> is maintained in tension. The resilient collar tends to urge plunger <b>36</b> to the right in the view. Many different spring elements (defined as anything tending to urge the plunger toward the tip of the conductive mesh) could be used for this purpose. As one example, a compression spring surrounding the cylindrical portion of plunger <b>36</b> could substitute for resilient collar <b>38</b>  and provide the desired spring element.</p>
<p id="p-0029" num="0027">Housing <b>40</b> is connected to the fabric of the glove or other garment. In this example, housing <b>40</b> is connected to fourchette <b>20</b>. The fourchette is made of elastic material. A somewhat undersized hole is punched or cut in this material. The assembled tactile touchscreen selector <b>32</b> is then pushed through the hole from left to right. Housing <b>40</b> is provided with flange <b>48</b> - which tends to arrest any further progress through the hole. Frictional forces alone may be sufficient to hold the assembly in place. However, in many applications, it is desirable to add an adhesive between the fourchette material (around the hole&#x2019;s perimeter) and flange <b>48</b> of housing <b>40</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0030" num="0028"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b></figref> shows the assembly of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b></figref> in an actuated state. In this case, the user has pressed conductive mesh <b>34</b> against the surface of a touchscreen. This action has propelled plunger <b>36</b> in the distal direction and caused tactile surface <b>44</b> to protrude from the rear of base <b>46</b>. Tactile surface <b>44</b> presses into the user&#x2019;s fingertip <b>42</b>, and this is easily perceived. Thus, the user is given positive tactile feedback as to when a &#x201c;pick&#x201d; has been made on the touchscreen.</p>
<p id="p-0031" num="0029">It is possible to &#x201c;tune&#x201d; the characteristics of the tactile touchscreen selector so that the user just perceives the protrusion of tactile surface <b>44</b> when a &#x201c;pick&#x201d; has been made on the touchscreen. This can be done via changing the spring coefficient on the spring element (resilient collar <b>38</b> in this example).</p>
<p id="p-0032" num="0030">In the example of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>4</b> and <b>5</b></figref>, the outer diameter of housing <b>40</b> (excluding flange <b>48</b>) is about 8 mm (0.315 inches). The overall depth of the device (from left to right in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>4</b> and <b>5</b></figref>) is also about 8 mm. The device is thus quite small and easy to add in many suitable locations.</p>
<p id="p-0033" num="0031"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>6</b></figref> shows glove <b>52</b> (made according to the present invention) being used to interact with touchscreen <b>50</b> and make a &#x201c;pick&#x201d; on a particular displayed icon <b>54</b>. In this example the tactile touchscreen indicator is in the position shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref> (tip of the index finger). However, those skilled in the art will know that it is sometimes convenient to use multiple contact points with a touchscreen. Multiple points are used for zooming operations and for reorientation operations.</p>
<p id="p-0034" num="0032"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>7</b></figref> shows another inventive embodiment in which four tactile touchscreen selectors <b>32</b> are included. These selectors are preferably placed in a position where the digit will naturally contact a touchscreen. These positions may need to be customized for some users. For instance, some users will prefer the tip of the thumb while other users will prefer the side of the thumb. It is possible to add the inventive selector by simply punching an undersized hole in the desired location and pressing the selector assembly through from the inside.</p>
<p id="p-0035" num="0033"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>8</b></figref> shows still another embodiment. In this version, two tactile touchscreen selectors <b>32</b> (of the type shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b></figref>) have been added to the back trank of the glove. These allow selections to be made with the back of the hand (while unusual this is a method that is known in some aircraft). Smaller selectors can be provided in other locations. In the example of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>8</b></figref>, three smaller selectors <b>56</b> are placed along the side of the index finger. These devices indicate to the pilot that the hand is properly positioned against a lateral stop (as in the case of some hand-on-throttle applications). The locations shown are exemplary as the inventive selector can be placed in many other locations. The reader should also bear in mind that a glove is only one type of garment that may be used to mount the inventive tactile touchscreen selector.</p>
<p id="p-0036" num="0034">The gloves used in the illustrations are slip-on flight gloves. It is also possible to apply the present invention to pressurized gloves in which the cuff is sealed to a pressure suit. Returning to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b></figref>, those skilled in the art will realize that the seals between the fourchette and housing <b>40</b>, as well as the seal between housing <b>40</b> and conductive mesh <b>38</b> can be made pressure tight (or in the alternative allow only a small leak rate).</p>
<p id="p-0037" num="0035">The materials selected for the tactile touchscreen selector are significant, in that a conductive path should be maintained between conductive mesh <b>34</b> and the user. This can be done via fourchette <b>20</b> but it is more preferably done through housing <b>40</b> and base <b>46</b>. In the version shown, the housing and the base are made from thin-walled aluminum. They could also be made from thermoplastic resin with a conductive additive. Plunger <b>36</b> can be made from a conductive material in order to ensure a conductive connection between tip <b>60</b> and the user&#x2019;s finger. Plunger <b>36</b> can be made from a thermoplastic resin with a conductive additive. Any of the relatively rigid components can also be made conductive via the addition of a conductive coating - such as nickel. The reader should bear in mind that in many instances the use of a conductive material for plunger <b>44</b> is unnecessary, since the other components <b>40</b>, <b>46</b> will tend to remain in contact with the fingertip.</p>
<p id="p-0038" num="0036">In some embodiments the inventive selector may not be used to interact with a touchscreen and may instead only provide tactile feedback. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>8</b></figref> provides a possible example. Selectors <b>56</b> along the side of the index finger need not be configured to interact with a touchscreen. In those examples, the use of a conductive material for any portion of the selector is unnecessary. The invention will thus be generally referred to as a &#x201c;tactile selector&#x201d; with an embodiment configured for a capacitive touchscreen being referred to as a &#x201c;tactile touchscreen selector.&#x201d;</p>
<p id="p-0039" num="0037">The preceding description contains significant detail, but it should not be construed as limiting the scope of the invention but rather as providing illustrations of the preferred embodiments of the invention. Thus, the scope of the invention should be fixed by the claims ultimately drafted, rather than by the examples given.</p>
