<p id="p-0001" num="0000">A paint brush cleaning system includes a housing and a paint brush cleaner attached to the housing. The housing contains solvent that helps clean a paint brush. The paint brush cleaner rotates a wire brush against the bristles of the paint brush and actuates a pump to eject solvent drawn from the housing as the paint brush is moved in translation. The wire brush is coupled to a retractable cord, which rotates the wire brush. A holder is simultaneously coupled to the retractable cord and the pump. When force is exerted on the holder, the retractable cord rotates the wire brush and the pump ejects solvent. A user can insert a paint brush handle through the holder, thus actuating the pump and rotating the wire brush by applying force to the handle. The housing attaches to a user's belt, providing easy access to the paint brush cleaning system.</p>

<p id="p-0003" num="0002">The disclosed teachings relate to a paint brush cleaning system. More specifically, the disclosed teachings relate to a paint brush cleaning system with a rolling wire brush and housing.</p>
<heading id="h-0003" level="1">BACKGROUND</heading>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">A paint brush is commonly made by clamping bristles to a handle with a ferrule. A paint brush can be used for any of a variety of applications, such as painting a house to small decorative paintings. The handle, bristles, and ferrule of the paint brush can be designed to best suit the intended application. For example, bristle shapes can be angled, flat, tapered, or in striker shapes for decorative painting purposes. Alternatively, for large scale projects, bristles can be flat, mop-like, or rounded.</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">It is generally recommended to clean as much of the paint off of a paint brush as possible after each use (e.g., switching paint colors). Cleaning a paint brush can include submerging the bristles into water or solvents and/or rubbing the bristles against, for example, a towel. The goal of cleaning is to remove the paint from the bristles to avoid the paint drying onto the bristles and to avoid mixing of colors when the brush is used later. Existing methods of cleaning a paint brush can be difficult, time-consuming and messy, especially for oil-based paints, which cannot be cleaned just with water. Also, a user may need multiple pieces of equipment to clean a paint brush. For example, a professional painter may need solvents, buckets, towels, water, and cleaning brushes (e.g., nylon or metal based) to sufficiently clean multiple paint brushes that have been used to apply multiple types and colors of paint. Thus, it is cumbersome for a painter that travels from project to project to transport the equipment.</p>

<heading id="h-0005" level="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION</heading>
<p id="p-0018" num="0017">Cleaning a paint brush after each use can prolong the life of the paint brush. Dried-on paint may not quickly dissolve when water and/or solvent is applied, so it's important to clean the paint brush quickly after using it. In addition, it's important to thoroughly clean the paint brush to prevent mixing of paints if the paint brush is used for more than one paint. However, existing methods of cleaning a paint brush are time-consuming and messy, often requiring large amounts of solvents. Other existing methods may require cleaning the paint brush under running water, which may not be easily accessible, for example, when painting on a ladder or scaffolding. Consequently, many people do not clean their paint brushes after use, or they do a poor job of cleaning the paint brushes, both of which can reduce the useful life of a paint brush.</p>
<p id="p-0019" num="0018">Currently, a user (e.g., a painter) can sometimes be forced to repeatedly apply water and/or solvent to the paint brush to remove the dried-on paint. This can require large amounts of solvents or multiple steps of applying solvent, water, and/or soap. Alternatively, the user can exert an external force such as rubbing the paint brush against a paper towel. In either case, the water and/or solvent alone is not sufficient. Further, the cleaning agents can be flammable, odorous, and release unhealthy gases. This issue becomes even more magnified for a non-professional painter. For example, parents of children need to be able to clean the paint brushes using child-friendly methods.</p>
<p id="p-0020" num="0019">Introduced here, therefore, is a paint brush cleaning system that removes paint from a paint brush. In at least some embodiments, a paint brush cleaner including a rotating wire brush and pump is coupled to a housing, which holds a liquid cleaning agent at the bottom. The rotating wire brush and pump are coupled to a brush holder that receives the handle of the paint brush. When the user pulls on the brush holder via the paint brush handle, the wire brush rotates against the bristles of the paint brush while the pump draws liquid from the holder and ejects the liquid onto the paint brush. Thus, the user can simultaneously apply solvent while removing paint from the paint brush with the mechanical action of the wire brush. The holder can attach to a user, such as by clipping to a user's belt, so the paint brush cleaning system can be carried along with the user and used in a variety of situations.</p>

<heading id="h-0007" level="2">Paint Brush Cleaning System</heading>
<p id="p-0022" num="0021"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref> depicts an embodiment of a paint brush cleaning system <b>100</b>. The paint brush cleaning system <b>100</b> includes a paint brush cleaner <b>110</b> and a housing <b>124</b>. The paint brush cleaner <b>110</b> includes a pump <b>112</b>, wire brush <b>114</b>, holder <b>116</b>, retractable cords <b>118</b>, and cables <b>120</b>. The housing <b>124</b> can be a pouch or other receptacle. For example, the housing <b>124</b> can be a reservoir, which contains liquid, such as water, paint thinner, mineral spirits, denatured alcohol, linseed oil, turpentine, acetone, or other suitable cleaning agents. The paint brush cleaner <b>110</b> can be attached to an interior surface of the housing <b>124</b> by an attachment mechanism, such as hooks, loops, adhesive, etc. For example, the attachment mechanism can be on a bottom surface of a base of the paint brush cleaner <b>110</b> while the other components of the paint brush cleaner <b>110</b> are on a top surface of the base. In some embodiments, the paint brush cleaner <b>110</b> can operate separately from the paint brush cleaning system <b>100</b>. For example, the paint brush cleaner <b>110</b> can be used without being attached to the housing <b>124</b> and instead be coupled to a sink or a table (e.g., via hooks).</p>
<p id="p-0023" num="0022">The paint brush cleaning system <b>100</b> can be attached to the user, such as on to a belt worn by the user. The paint brush cleaning system <b>100</b> can be attached to a user's belt such that the user can access the paint brush cleaning system while working in a variety of situations, such as on a ladder, rooftop, or mechanical lift. The paint brush cleaning system <b>100</b> can be attached to a belt or other clothing by clips, hooks, rings, snaps, hook and loop fasteners, or other attachment mechanisms. The housing <b>124</b> can be attached directly to the belt or other clothing, or the housing <b>124</b> can be attached indirectly to the clothing. In some embodiments, the paint brush cleaning system <b>100</b> includes a belt or strap, such as shoulder strap, so the user can carry the paint brush cleaning system <b>100</b> by putting the strap around the user's shoulders, for example. In some embodiments, the paint brush cleaning system <b>100</b> can be attached to a ladder, a wall, a bucket, or other suitable locations by similar attachment mechanisms. For instance, a hooking mechanism can be attached to the housing <b>124</b>, which can hook onto a bucket.</p>
<p id="p-0024" num="0023">The paint brush cleaner <b>110</b> can include a pump <b>112</b>, which can draw liquid from the bottom of the housing <b>124</b>, for example through inlet valves <b>122</b>. The liquid can be paint thinner, water, mineral spirits, or another solvent. The pump can be attached to a top surface of a base. For example, the pump can be attached to the top surface of the base by nails, screws, bolts, snaps, or adhesive. A user can activate the pump <b>112</b> by exerting a force on the holder <b>116</b>. The pump <b>112</b> can include a piston that can draw liquid from the housing <b>124</b> and cause the pump <b>112</b> to eject the liquid through a nozzle toward the paint brush. In some embodiments, a user can dip a paint brush directly into solvent in the housing <b>124</b> to help clean the paint brush without activating the pump <b>112</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0025" num="0024">The pump <b>112</b> can include a chamber, a piston, and a nozzle <b>126</b>. The chamber and piston will be shown in greater details in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>5</b>A-C</figref>. The nozzle <b>126</b> can be, for example, multiple openings that allow the liquid from inside the pump <b>112</b> to be eject into housing <b>124</b>. The pump can be configured to draw liquid from a reservoir into the chamber. When the piston is moved, pressure is built within the chamber, causing the liquid to be ejected through the nozzle <b>126</b>. The nozzle <b>126</b> can be configured to spray the liquid at a desired pressure. The piston can be coupled to a holder <b>116</b>, which the user can use to position the paint brush. For example, the piston can be pulled by a cable <b>120</b> coupled to the holder <b>116</b>. The user can then pull the paint brush against the holder <b>116</b> to cause the piston to move, thereby activating the pump <b>112</b> to spray the liquid through the nozzle <b>126</b>. The liquid can be any suitable solvent to help clean the paint brush, such as water, paint thinner, or mineral spirits.</p>
<p id="p-0026" num="0025">The paint brush cleaner <b>110</b>, in some embodiments, includes a wire brush <b>114</b> coupled to spindles positioned on either side of the wire brush <b>114</b>. The wire brush <b>114</b> can be cylindrical and rotate along a central axis. The spindles rotate to allow the cylindrical brush to also rotate. The spindles are coupled to retractable cords <b>118</b>, which cause the spindle and cylindrical brush to rotate as the retractable cords <b>118</b> are extended from a housing. The spindles are further coupled to, for example, torsion springs, which can be configured to cause the cord to retract into the housing. The retractable cords <b>118</b> can be coupled to a holder <b>116</b>, which the user can use to position the paint brush. Thus, the user can pull the paint brush against the holder <b>116</b> to extend the retractable cords <b>118</b> and rotate the wire brush as the bristles of the paint brush are drawn across it. The torsion springs cause the retractable cords <b>118</b> to retract, which enables the user to repeatedly pull the paint brush against the rotating wire brush with less effort.</p>
<p id="p-0027" num="0026">In some embodiments, the paint brush cleaner <b>110</b> includes both a wire brush <b>114</b> and a pump <b>112</b>, as described above. The wire brush <b>114</b> and the pump <b>112</b> can both be coupled to a holder <b>116</b>, which the user can use to position the paint brush. For example, the wire brush <b>114</b> can be coupled to retractable cords <b>118</b>, which cause the wire brush <b>114</b> to rotate as the retractable cords <b>118</b> are pulled. The pump <b>112</b> can be coupled to cables <b>120</b>, which move a piston within the pump <b>112</b> as the cables <b>120</b> are pulled. The retractable cords <b>118</b>, cables <b>120</b>, and holder <b>116</b> can all be coupled to a single bar or rod, such that the user can pull the paint brush against the holder <b>116</b> to simultaneously cause the wire brush <b>114</b> to rotate and to spray liquid from the pump <b>112</b>. Thus, the paint brush can be cleaned from the mechanical action of the rotating wire brush <b>114</b> as well as the liquid from the pump <b>112</b>. In addition, the wire brush <b>114</b> can be coupled to torsion springs, which then pull the paint brush back to its initial position. The user can thus quickly and repeatedly rotate the wire brush <b>114</b> and activate the pump <b>112</b> to clean the paint brush.</p>
<p id="p-0028" num="0027">The housing <b>124</b> is configured to be worn, for example, on the user's belt and to hold liquid at the bottom of the housing. The housing can further be configured to hold the components of the paint brush cleaner <b>110</b>, including the wire brush <b>114</b> and the pump <b>112</b>, with the holder <b>116</b> positioned near the top of the housing. The holder <b>116</b> can be configured to receive the handle of a paint brush, such that the user can pull the paint brush handled against holder <b>116</b> to rotate the wire brush <b>114</b> and activate the pump <b>112</b>. This allows the user to clean the paint brush without needing to go to a sink or bucket. For example, the user could clean his or her paint brush while standing on a ladder. The housing <b>124</b> also minimizes splashing of harmful solvents such as paint thinner, as the liquid and the paint brush cleaner <b>110</b> are contained in the housing <b>124</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0029" num="0028"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref> depicts an embodiment of a paint brush cleaner <b>200</b>. Paint brush cleaner <b>200</b> includes holder <b>202</b>, spindle mechanism <b>204</b>, base <b>206</b>, bar <b>208</b>, wire brush <b>210</b>, pump <b>212</b>, nozzles <b>214</b>, retractable cords <b>216</b>, and cables <b>218</b>. The paint brush cleaner <b>200</b> can be similar to paint brush cleaner <b>110</b> in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>. Spindle mechanism <b>204</b> can be coupled to the wire brush <b>210</b>. Retractable cords <b>216</b> can be retractable and be coupled to spindle mechanism <b>204</b>. When the retractable cords <b>216</b> are extended or retracted, the spindle mechanism <b>204</b> can rotate and cause the wire brush <b>210</b> to rotate. The retractable cords <b>216</b> can be coupled to bar <b>208</b>. Holder <b>202</b> can be also coupled to the bar <b>208</b>, so when force is exerted on the holder <b>202</b>, the bar <b>208</b> also exerts force on the retractable cords <b>216</b>, causing the wire brush <b>210</b> to rotate via the spindle mechanism <b>204</b>. When a paint brush is placed on top of wire brush <b>210</b> and exerts a force on the holder <b>202</b>, the wire brush <b>210</b> rotates to clean the paint brush. The spindle mechanism <b>204</b> can include a torsion spring that exerts a force to retract retractable cords <b>216</b>. If the user exerts a force on holder <b>202</b> to extend retractable cords <b>216</b>, then the torsion spring can exert an opposite force to retract retractable cords <b>216</b>. Thus, the user can quickly and repeatedly clean the paint brush against the wire brush <b>210</b> by alternating between exerting and releasing a force on holder <b>202</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0030" num="0029">The pump <b>212</b> can draw liquid into a chamber within the pump <b>212</b>, such as water, paint thinner, or other solvents. The liquid can be drawn from inlet valves at an end of pump <b>212</b>. The pump <b>212</b> can include a piston which moves within the chamber. Movement of the piston within the pump <b>212</b> can build pressure in the chamber, causing the liquid to be expelled through nozzles <b>214</b>. In some embodiments, liquid can be drawn into the chamber of pump <b>212</b> by the movement of the piston. Cables <b>218</b> can be coupled to a piston within pump <b>212</b>. Cables <b>218</b> can also be coupled to bar <b>208</b>. When force is exerted on holder <b>202</b>, the bar <b>208</b> exerts force on cables <b>218</b>, moving the piston of pump <b>212</b> and causing liquid to spray from the nozzles <b>214</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0031" num="0030">The paint brush cleaner <b>200</b> can include the wire brush <b>210</b> and the pump <b>212</b>. When cables <b>218</b> and retractable cords <b>216</b> are both coupled to bar <b>208</b>, exerting force on the holder <b>202</b> can simultaneously pull both retractable cords <b>216</b> and cables <b>218</b>, which respectively rotate the wire brush <b>210</b> via the spindle mechanism <b>204</b> and activate the pump <b>212</b>. A user can place a paint brush on top of wire brush <b>210</b> and use the paint brush to exert a force on holder <b>202</b>. This can allow the wire brush <b>210</b> to scrub the paint brush while pump <b>212</b> applies solvent to the paint brush with a single motion of the paint brush. As described above, this motion can be repeated quickly with the help of torsion springs included in spindle mechanism <b>204</b>. Simultaneously activating the wire brush and pump can result in more efficient and thorough cleaning of the paint brush compared to scrubbing the paint brush and applying solvent separately.</p>
<p id="p-0032" num="0031">In some embodiments, the position of the wire brush <b>210</b> can be adjustable. For example, the base <b>206</b> can include a groove <b>220</b> (or notches) that allow the spindle mechanism <b>204</b> to be positioned at different sections along the base <b>206</b>. The position of the wire brush <b>210</b> can thus be adjusted by adjusting the position of the spindle mechanism <b>204</b> on either side of the wire brush <b>210</b>. Adjusting the position of the wire brush <b>210</b> can allow a user to clean paint brushes of various sizes. For example, a user may want to move the wire brush <b>210</b> closer to the nozzles <b>214</b> of pump <b>212</b> to clean a paint brush with shorter bristles. In another example, the user may want to position the wire brush <b>210</b> directly above the nozzles <b>214</b> to remove paint residue from the wire brush <b>210</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0033" num="0032">In some embodiments, the paint brush cleaner <b>200</b> can be modular. For example, the wire brush <b>210</b> can be replaceable with brushes made of various materials, such as nylon or polyester. In another example, the spindle mechanism <b>204</b> can be replaced with a different mechanism to rotate the wire brush, such as a circular gear, as discussed below and shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>6</b></figref>. In another example, the pump <b>212</b> can be replaced with a different pump better suited for different solvents. In another example, the pump <b>212</b> and/or wire brush <b>210</b> can be removable.</p>
<p id="p-0034" num="0000">Spindle mechanism</p>
<p id="p-0035" num="0033"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref> depicts an exposed view of a spindle mechanism <b>300</b> of an embodiment of a paint brush cleaner. The spindle mechanism <b>300</b> includes a spindle <b>302</b>, a spindle housing <b>304</b>, a retractable cord <b>306</b>, a torsion spring <b>308</b>, and an opening <b>310</b>. The spindle mechanism <b>300</b> can be similar to the spindle mechanism <b>504</b> in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b></figref>. The spindle <b>302</b>, retractable cord <b>306</b>, and torsion spring <b>308</b> can be within the spindle housing <b>304</b>, with one end of the retractable cord <b>306</b> emerging through the opening <b>310</b>. The retractable cord <b>306</b> can be coiled, such that when the retractable cord <b>306</b> is pulled through the opening <b>310</b>, the retractable cord <b>306</b> uncoils and exerts a torque on the spindle <b>302</b>, causing spindle <b>302</b> to rotate. The rotation of the spindle <b>302</b> can be coupled with a wire brush, such as wire brush <b>210</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref>, so that rotating the spindle <b>302</b> causes the wire brush to rotate. The retractable cord <b>306</b> can be pulled, for example, by pulling on a bar <b>312</b>. This allows a user to pull on the retractable cord <b>306</b> or bar <b>312</b> to rotate the wire brush.</p>
<p id="p-0036" num="0034">The torsion spring <b>308</b> can be coupled to the spindle <b>302</b> to exert a torque on the spindle <b>302</b> and cause the spindle <b>302</b> to rotate. A torsion spring can exert a torque in an opposite direction of its displacement from an equilibrium angle. Thus, the torsion spring <b>308</b> can be configured such that as the retractable cord <b>306</b> is pulled through the opening <b>310</b>, the spindle <b>302</b> rotates in a first direction and causes the torsion spring <b>308</b> to exert a torque opposite of the first direction. The torque exerted by the torsion spring <b>308</b> causes the spindle to rotate opposite of the first direction and retract the retractable cord <b>306</b> into the spindle housing <b>304</b>. A user can thus exert a force on the retractable cord <b>306</b> to rotate the spindle <b>302</b> then release the force to allow the torsion spring <b>308</b> to rotate the spindle back toward equilibrium. This allows a user to quickly and repeatedly rotate the spindle <b>302</b>. If the spindle <b>302</b> is coupled to a wire brush, then this allows the wire brush to quickly rotate and scrub a paint brush.</p>
<p id="p-0037" num="0035">Note that only one end of bar <b>312</b> is shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref>. However, a paint brush cleaner can include more than one spindle mechanism <b>300</b>. For example, a paint brush cleaner can include two spindle mechanisms <b>300</b>, one on each end of a cylindrical wire brush. In this example, the retractable cords <b>306</b> of each spindle mechanism can be coupled to the same bar <b>312</b> near respective ends of the bar <b>312</b>. The components of the spindle mechanism <b>300</b> need not be arranged exactly as depicted in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref>. For example, the spindle mechanism <b>300</b> can be manufactured with the torsion spring <b>308</b> to the left of the spindle <b>302</b> and the retractable cord <b>306</b> to the right of the spindle <b>302</b>.</p>

<p id="p-0038" num="0036"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b></figref> depicts a pump <b>400</b> of an embodiment of a paint brush cleaner. The pump <b>400</b> includes nozzles <b>402</b>, a piston <b>404</b>, a one-way valve <b>406</b>, inlet valves <b>408</b>, and fasteners <b>410</b>. In some embodiments, the fasteners <b>410</b> attach the pump <b>400</b> to a base, such as base <b>206</b> in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref> or base <b>606</b> in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>6</b></figref>. In some embodiments, the fasteners can be screws, nails, bolts/nuts, etc. In some embodiments, the pump <b>400</b> is attached to a base without fasteners <b>410</b>, or not attached to a base at all.</p>
<p id="p-0039" num="0037">The pump <b>400</b> includes a lower portion <b>412</b> and an upper portion <b>414</b>, which can be divided by the piston <b>404</b>. The piston <b>404</b> can move back and forth in a first direction toward the nozzles <b>402</b><i>a </i>and <b>402</b><i>b </i>and a second direction toward the inlet valves <b>408</b>, which cause the lower portion <b>412</b> and upper portion <b>414</b> to change in size accordingly. Liquid can enter the pump through inlet valves <b>408</b> and into the upper chamber through one-way valve <b>406</b>. The liquid can be water, paint thinner, or another solvent to help clean a paint brush. As the piston <b>404</b> moves in the first direction, pressure can build in the upper portion <b>414</b> as the upper portion <b>414</b> decreases in volume. The nozzles <b>402</b><i>a </i>and <b>402</b><i>b </i>can be configured to expel the liquid within the upper portion <b>412</b> when the pressure is reaches a desired pressure. The nozzles <b>402</b><i>a </i>and <b>402</b><i>b </i>can expel the liquid onto a paint brush positioned over the nozzles <b>402</b><i>a </i>and <b>402</b><i>b</i>. In some embodiments, the nozzles <b>402</b> can be positioned to expel the liquid onto a wire brush and clean the wire brush. The nozzles <b>402</b><i>a </i>and <b>402</b><i>b </i>can be configured to expel liquid in a variety of directions depending on the desired coverage.</p>
<p id="p-0040" num="0038">In some embodiments, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b></figref>, there can be different sized nozzles <b>402</b><i>a </i>and <b>402</b><i>b</i>. A smaller nozzle <b>402</b><i>a </i>can have a smaller diameter than a larger nozzle <b>402</b><i>b </i>and expel liquid at higher pressure, while the larger nozzle <b>402</b><i>b </i>can allow liquid to flow even if debris builds up in the nozzles. In some embodiments, the larger nozzles <b>402</b><i>b </i>can be positioned separately from the smaller nozzles <b>402</b><i>a</i>, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b></figref>. In some embodiments, the nozzles <b>402</b><i>a </i>and <b>402</b><i>b </i>can be positioned together. In some embodiments, the nozzles <b>402</b><i>a </i>and <b>402</b><i>b </i>can be a uniform size.</p>
<p id="p-0041" num="0039">The pump <b>400</b> can be positioned such that the inlet valves <b>408</b> are submerged in liquid, such as in a bucket, pouch, or other reservoir. As the piston moves in the first direction, liquid can be drawn from the reservoir through the inlet valves <b>408</b> by suction. A one-way valve <b>406</b> can be built into the piston <b>404</b>. When the piston moves in the second direction, the one-way valve can open to allow liquid to pass from the lower portion <b>412</b> to the upper portion <b>414</b>. The one-way valve <b>406</b> can be configured to prevent liquid from flowing from the upper portion <b>414</b> to the lower portion <b>412</b>, so that when the piston moves in the first direction toward the nozzles <b>402</b>, liquid is forced through the nozzles <b>402</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0042" num="0040"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b>A</figref> depicts a pump <b>500</b> of an embodiment of a paint brush cleaner in a first position. The pump <b>500</b> can be similar to pump <b>400</b> depicted in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b></figref>. The pump <b>500</b> includes nozzles <b>502</b>, a piston <b>504</b>, a one-way valve <b>506</b>, and inlet valves <b>508</b>. The pump <b>500</b> includes a lower portion <b>510</b> and an upper portion <b>512</b>, divided by the piston <b>504</b>. The piston <b>504</b> can include a seal made of rubber, silicone, or another material that prevents liquid from flowing between the lower portion <b>510</b> and the upper portion <b>512</b>. The piston <b>504</b> can move back and forth in a first direction toward the nozzles <b>502</b> and a second direction toward the inlet valves <b>508</b>, which cause the lower portion <b>510</b> and upper portion <b>512</b> to change in size accordingly. Pump <b>500</b> in the first position, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b>A</figref>, has a relatively small lower portion <b>510</b> and a larger upper portion <b>512</b>, with the piston <b>504</b> at an end of the pump. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b>A</figref> shows the one-way valve <b>506</b> in an open position, which allows liquid to flow into the upper portion <b>512</b> from lower portion <b>510</b>.</p>

<p id="p-0044" num="0042"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b>C</figref> depicts a pump <b>500</b> of an embodiment of a paint brush cleaner in a third position. The piston <b>504</b> is now positioned nearer to the nozzles <b>502</b>. As the volume of the upper portion <b>512</b> decreases, the pressure in the upper portion <b>512</b> increases, which can cause liquid to be expelled through the nozzles <b>502</b>, as shown. The liquid can be a solvent that helps clean a paint brush. In addition to the chemical properties of the liquid, the force of the liquid being expelled from nozzles <b>502</b> can also help clean the paint brush. After the liquid is expelled, the pump <b>500</b> can be returned to the first position, as depicted in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b>A</figref>.

Holder <b>602</b> can be coupled to the slider <b>608</b> such that when force is exerted on the holder <b>602</b>, the gears <b>604</b> are rotated, which causes both the slider <b>608</b> and holder <b>602</b> move in the direction of the force and along guide tracks <b>612</b>. Slider <b>608</b> can be coupled to the base <b>606</b> such that slider <b>608</b> can move across the length of the base <b>606</b> when force is exerted. When a paint brush is placed on top of wire brush <b>610</b> and exerts a force, the wire brush <b>610</b> rotates to clean the paint brush.</p>
<p id="p-0046" num="0044">Sliding element <b>600</b> can be a component in a paint brush cleaning system. For example, sliding element <b>600</b> can be placed in a housing, such as housing <b>124</b> in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>, pump <b>212</b> in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref>, or pump <b>400</b> in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b></figref>. The pump can be attached to the top surface of the base <b>606</b>. In this example, sliding element <b>600</b> can be used similarly to paint brush cleaner <b>110</b> in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>. Sliding element <b>600</b> can function similarly to paint brush cleaner <b>200</b> in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref>. and be used in conjunction with a pump, such as pump <b>112</b> in FIG. <b>1</b>The gears <b>604</b> and slider <b>608</b> can rotate the wire brush <b>610</b> similarly to a spindle mechanism and retractable cord, such as spindle mechanism <b>204</b> and retractable cord <b>216</b>, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref>. In some embodiments, the gears <b>604</b> and slider <b>608</b> can be interchangeable with the spindle mechanism and retractable cord.</p>
<p id="p-0047" num="0045">In some embodiments, parts of the sliding element <b>600</b> are made of corrosion resistant materials such as stainless steel, aluminum, copper, bronze, brass, or galvanize steel. In some embodiments, parts of the sliding element <b>600</b> are made of plastic and/or polyester based compounds. For example, the sliding element <b>600</b> can be made of a combination of corrosion resistance and other materials. For instance, the gear <b>604</b> can be made of stainless steel, the holder <b>602</b> can be plastic, and the remaining parts can be polymer-based.</p>
<p id="p-0048" num="0046">In some embodiments, the holder <b>602</b> can receive a paint brush such that the bristles of the paint brush are positioned on top of the wire brush <b>610</b> and the handle of the paint brush protrudes through the holder <b>602</b>, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>7</b></figref>. In some embodiments, the holder <b>602</b> is made of flexible and stretchable material such as rubber, or coiled compositions such as a spring. For example, the holder <b>602</b> can be made of rubber such that the holder <b>602</b> can stretch to receive paint brushes of various size and shapes. The holder <b>602</b> can be similar to the holder <b>116</b> in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref> and the holder <b>202</b> in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0049" num="0047">In some embodiments, the holder <b>602</b> can be a single straight piece of flexible material. The material can be bent such that the opposite ends are coupled to the slider <b>608</b> to form a U-shaped holder <b>602</b>. For example, the holder <b>602</b> can be a straight piece of rubber. Each end of the rubber piece can be glued to the slider <b>608</b> to form a protruding portion (e.g., U-shaped portion). The protruding portion can receive the handle of a paint brush and help the user position the bristles against the wire brush <b>610</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0050" num="0048">The gears <b>604</b> can be coupled to each side of the wire brush <b>610</b>. The gears <b>604</b> are mounted so that their teeth interlock with the teeth on the slider <b>608</b>. In some embodiments, sliding element <b>600</b> can include only one gear. For example, one side of paint brush cleaner can include a gear and the other side can be a free rotating bearing. In some embodiments, when force is exerted on any of the wire brush <b>610</b>, the gears <b>604</b>, the holder <b>602</b>, and/or the slider <b>608</b>, the components will move in the direction of the force.

For example, if a force is exerted on holder <b>602</b> in a direction towards the base <b>606</b>, the slider <b>608</b> will move in that direction and the wire brush <b>610</b> and gears <b>604</b> will rotate counter-clockwise. In another example, a paint brush can be inserted through the holder <b>602</b> such that the bristles rest on the wire brush <b>610</b>. The handle of the paint brush can protrude through the holder <b>602</b>. The user can subsequently pull or push the handle to exert force on the holder <b>602</b>. By exerting force on the holder <b>602</b>, the wire brush <b>610</b> will rotate against the paint brush to clean it.</p>
<p id="p-0051" num="0049">In some embodiments, the base <b>606</b> can include a mechanism on the back side which allows the sliding element <b>600</b> to be attached to another object and/or surface. For example, the coupling mechanism can be a hooking mechanism which can hook on to a bucket of solvent. A user can hook the sliding element <b>600</b> to the bucket and submerge a paint brush into the solvent while also rubbing the paint brush against wire brush <b>610</b>. In another example, the base <b>606</b> can include suction cups. A user can affix the sliding element <b>600</b> to a surface near a working area using the suction cups. In some embodiments, the sliding element <b>600</b> can be affixed to a housing, such as housing <b>124</b> in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0052" num="0050"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>7</b></figref> depicts a side view <b>700</b> of a paint brush and an embodiment of a sliding element. Side view <b>700</b> includes paint brush <b>702</b> and sliding element <b>704</b>. Paint brush <b>702</b> includes handle <b>702</b>A, ferrule <b>702</b>B, bristles <b>702</b>C, and top of ferrule <b>702</b>D. The handle <b>702</b>A is connected to the ferrule <b>702</b>B, which grips the bristles <b>702</b>C. Sliding element <b>704</b> includes base <b>704</b>A, toothed slider <b>704</b>B, holder <b>704</b>C, wire brush <b>704</b>D, and guide track <b>704</b>E. Sliding element <b>704</b> has similar functionality to sliding element <b>600</b> described in conjunction with <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>6</b></figref>. For example, sliding element <b>704</b> can be included in a paint brush cleaning system similar to paint brush cleaning system <b>100</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>. Sliding element <b>704</b> can be attached to a housing, such as housing <b>124</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>. Sliding element <b>704</b> can include a pump attached to the top surface of the base <b>704</b>A, such as pump <b>112</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>, pump <b>212</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref>, or pump <b>400</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b></figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0053" num="0051">In some embodiments, the handle <b>702</b>A of the paint brush can be used to actuate the wire brush <b>704</b>D via the holder <b>704</b>C, toothed slider <b>704</b>B and gears <b>604</b>, such that bristles <b>702</b>C are cleaned. More specifically, in some embodiments, a user can insert handle <b>702</b>A through holder <b>704</b>C such that top of ferrule <b>702</b>D is pressed against the holder <b>704</b>C. The user can then hold both the handle <b>702</b>A and holder <b>704</b>C to actuate the wire brush <b>704</b>D. In some embodiments, a user can place the paint brush <b>702</b> such that an end of the handle <b>702</b>A is pressed against the end of the holder <b>704</b>C and the bristles <b>702</b>C are resting on top of wire brush <b>704</b>D (e.g., as depicted in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>7</b></figref>).</p>
<p id="p-0054" num="0052">In some embodiments, the wire brush <b>704</b>D can rotate until the toothed slider <b>704</b>B has moved with guide track <b>704</b>E and across the length of the base <b>704</b>A. For example, the base <b>704</b>A can be five inches long and allow the toothed slider <b>704</b>B to travel four inches. Further, the wire brush <b>704</b>D can have a circumference of two inches. Thus, the wire brush <b>704</b>D can make two rotations before the toothed slider <b>704</b>B has covered the maximum travel distance. In other words, the wire brush <b>704</b>D can clean four inches of the bristles <b>702</b>C before the toothed slider <b>704</b>B has to slide in the opposite direction.</p>
<p id="p-0055" num="0053">In some embodiments, the starting position of the paint brush <b>702</b> can depend on the length of the bristles <b>702</b>C in relation to the length that toothed slider <b>704</b>B can slide.</p>
<p id="p-0056" num="0054">For example, the bristles <b>702</b>C can be ten inches long, while the toothed slider <b>704</b>B can slide five inches. Thus, a user can recognize the entire length of the bristles <b>702</b>C cannot be cleaned while the paint brush <b>702</b> is in the same position. A user can first place the paint brush <b>702</b> such that the end of handle <b>702</b>A is pressed against the end of holder <b>704</b>C. In this position, a first half (e.g., the half closest from ferrule <b>702</b>B) can be cleaned. In the next iteration, the user can push handle <b>704</b>a further away from sliding element <b>704</b> such that the portion where the handle <b>702</b>A and ferrule <b>702</b>B meet is pressed against the end of holder <b>704</b>C. In this position, the half further from the ferrule <b>702</b>B can be cleaned by wire brush <b>704</b>D.</p>
<p id="p-0057" num="0055">In some embodiments, the sliding element <b>704</b> can be modular such that each component can be replaced or exchanged with a different component. For example, to accommodate for a larger paint brush <b>702</b>, a user can exchange base <b>704</b>A and toothed slider <b>704</b>B for longer versions. In another example, the bristles <b>702</b>C can be too soft for a wire brush, and thus, user can replace wire brush <b>704</b>D with a softer brush. In yet another example, the user can replace the holder <b>704</b>C with a different holder that is configured to accommodate a longer handle <b>702</b>A.</p>
<p id="p-0058" num="0056"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>8</b>A</figref> depicts a paint brush handle inserted through a holder of an embodiment of a sliding element in a first position. First position <b>800</b>A includes paint brush <b>802</b> and sliding element <b>804</b>. The paint brush <b>802</b> includes handle <b>802</b>A and top of ferrule <b>802</b>B. As mentioned above, the top of ferrule <b>802</b>B can be pressed against the holder <b>804</b>A such that that the handle <b>802</b>A protrudes from the other side of holder <b>804</b>A. In some embodiments, a user can first insert the handle <b>802</b>A through holder <b>804</b>A. The user can then use handle <b>802</b>A to move the paint brush <b>802</b> back and forth against the wire brush <b>804</b>B. In some embodiments, the user can grip both the handle <b>802</b>A and the holder <b>804</b>A. By doing so, the user can move the paint brush <b>802</b> in sync with the rotation of the wire brush <b>804</b>B. In some embodiments, the user can move the paint brush <b>802</b> against the top of the wire brush <b>804</b>B, as depicted in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>8</b>A</figref>. In some embodiments, the user can move the paint brush <b>802</b> against the bottom of the wire brush <b>804</b>B.</p>
<p id="p-0059" num="0057"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>8</b>B</figref> depicts a paint brush handle inserted through a holder of an embodiment of a sliding element in a second position. Second position <b>800</b>B includes paint brush <b>802</b> and sliding element <b>804</b>. A user can clean the paint brush <b>802</b> by gripping handle <b>802</b>A and moving the paint brush <b>802</b> against wire brush <b>804</b>B. For example, if the sliding element <b>804</b> is horizontal (e.g., resting on top of a desk), the user can move the paint brush <b>802</b> back and forth against the wire brush <b>804</b>B. In this case, the force exerted by the user can be in the same direction as the movement of the paint brush <b>802</b>. Although the user can choose to exert a downward force to press the paint brush <b>802</b> against the wire brush <b>804</b>B, it is not required. Alternatively, if the sliding element <b>804</b> is vertical (e.g., hanging from the side of a water bucket), the force exerted by the user can be both in the direction of the movement of the paint brush <b>802</b> and in a direction towards the wire brush <b>804</b>B. By exerting force in the direction of the wire brush <b>804</b>B, the user ensures that the paint brush <b>802</b> is making sufficient contact with the wire brush <b>804</b>B to clean the paint brush <b>802</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0060" num="0058">The sliding element <b>804</b> can be affixed to a housing, such as housing <b>124</b> in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>. The housing can be attached to a user's belt, so the user can position the paint brush <b>802</b> at his or her waist or hip, with the handle <b>802</b>A inserted through the holder <b>804</b>A. The user can then clean the paint brush using the motion described above. Affixing the sliding element <b>804</b> to a housing worn at waist level provides the user with a convenient and portable way to clean the paint brush <b>802</b>. The sliding element <b>804</b> can further be coupled to a pump, such as pump <b>112</b> in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref> or pump <b>400</b> in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b></figref>. The pump can be actuated and eject solvent in concert with the movement of the sliding element <b>804</b>, allowing the user to more thoroughly clean the paint brush.</p>
