<abstract id="abstract">
<p id="p-0001" num="0000">An oximetry device sealed in a sheath directs a user to allow the oximetry device to make oximetry readings at a number of different tissue locations of a patient and average two or more of the oximetry readings by directing the lifts and placements of the oximetry device and sheath to and from the different tissue locations and detecting the lift and placements. The averages are generated and displayed on a display of the device for the oximetry readings if the lifts are made while use directions for the lifts are displayed on a display of the oximetry device. The averages are not generated if the lifts are not made while the user directions for the lifts are not displayed. The averages are simultaneously displayed with the oximetry readings which are instantaneous measurement for patient tissue.</p>

<heading id="h-0002" level="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">This invention relates generally to optical systems that monitor parameters related to oxygen levels in tissue. More and sheaths for the optical probes that shield the optical probes from contaminants during use and specifically, the present invention relates to optical probes, such as compact, handheld oximeters, communicate status information to the optical probes regarding contaminant protection so that the optical probes are reusable.</p>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">Oximeters are medical devices used to measure the oxygen saturation of tissue in humans and living things for various purposes. For example, oximeters are used for medical and diagnostic purposes in hospitals and other medical facilities (e.g., operating rooms for surgery, recovery room for patient monitoring, or ambulance or other mobile monitoring for, e.g., hypoxia); sports and athletic purposes at a sports arena (e.g., professional athlete monitoring); personal or at-home monitoring of individuals (e.g., general health monitoring, or person training for a marathon); and veterinary purposes (e.g., animal monitoring).</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">In particular, assessing a patient's oxygen saturation, at both the regional and local levels, is important as it is an indicator of the state of the patient's health. Thus, oximeters are often used in clinical settings, such as during surgery and recovery, where it can be suspected that the patient's tissue oxygenation state is unstable. For example, during surgery, oximeters should be able to quickly deliver accurate oxygen saturation measurements under a variety of non-ideal conditions.</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">Pulse oximeters and tissue oximeters are two types of oximeters that operate on different principles. A pulse oximeter requires a pulse in order to function. A pulse oximeter typically measures the absorbance of light due to pulsing arterial blood. In contrast, a tissue oximeter does not require a pulse in order to function, and can be used to make oxygen saturation measurements of a tissue flap that has been disconnected from a blood supply.</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">Human tissue, as an example, includes a variety of light-absorbing molecules. Such chromophores include oxygenated hemoglobin, deoxygenated hemoglobin, melanin, water, lipid, and cytochrome. Oxygenated and deoxygenated hemoglobins are the dominant chromophores in tissue for much of the visible and near-infrared spectral range. Light absorption differs significantly for oxygenated and deoxygenated hemoglobins at certain wavelengths of light. Tissue oximeters can measure oxygen levels in human tissue by exploiting these light-absorption differences.</p>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">Despite the success of existing oximeters, there is a continuing desire to improve oximeters by, for example, improving the reuse of oximeters; reducing or eliminating contamination during use; improving remote communication; improving measurement accuracy; reducing measurement time; lowering cost through reuse; reducing size, weight, or form factor; reducing power consumption; and for other reasons, and any combination of these.</p>
<p id="p-0009" num="0008">Therefore, there is a need for improved tissue oximetry devices and methods of shielding oximetry devices during use for reuse of the devices.</p>
<heading id="h-0003" level="1">BRIEF SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0010" num="0009">Embodiments relate to a compact, handheld oximeter and measurement averaging of oximetry readings performed by the handheld oximeter. The average measurement and real-time oximetry readings can be displayed on a display of the oximeter to provide medical professionals with valuable oximetry information useful for diagnosing an oximetry state of patient tissue.</p>
<p id="p-0011" num="0010">In an implementation, an oximetry device is sealed in a sheath where a user can contact the sheath to a number of different tissue locations to allow the oximetry device to make oximetry measurements of the tissue. The oximetry device averages two or more of the oximetry readings by detecting the sheath being placed in contact with the tissue locations and being lifted from contact from the tissue locations. The average is generated and displayed on a display of the oximetry device for the oximetry readings if the lifts are made while use directions for the lifts are displayed on a display of the oximetry device. The averages are not generated if the lifts are not made while the user directions for the lifts are not displayed. The averages are simultaneously displayed with the oximetry readings which are instantaneous measurement for patient tissue. The averaging allows a user of the oximetry device to monitor the oximetry information as an average as tissue conditions of the tissue change during a surgery. Being able to monitor how the average value changes over time by viewing the average displayed on the display allows the user to obtain a history of the tissue during the surgery to perform more successful surgeries, such as tissue flap surgeries where real-time and average oximetry information of a tissue flap allows for the flap to be trimmed or not trimmed based on the real-time and average information for more successful flap grafting.</p>

<heading id="h-0005" level="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0041" num="0040">Spectroscopy has been used for noninvasive measurements of various physiological properties in animal and human subjects. Visible (e.g., red light) and near-infrared spectroscopy is often utilized because physiological tissues have relatively low scattering in these spectral ranges. Human tissues, for example, include numerous light-absorbing chromophores, such as oxygenated hemoglobin, deoxygenated hemoglobin, melanin, water, lipid, and cytochrome. The hemoglobins are the dominant chromophores in tissue for much of the visible and near-infrared spectral range and via light absorption, contribute to the color of human tissues. In the visible and near-infrared range, oxygenated and deoxygenated hemoglobins have significantly different absorption features. Accordingly, visible and near-infrared spectroscopy has been applied to exploit these different absorption features for measuring oxygen levels in physiological media, such as tissue hemoglobin oxygen saturation (sometimes referred to as oxygen saturation) and total hemoglobin concentrations.</p>
<p id="p-0042" num="0041">Spatially-resolved spectroscopy (SRS) is one type of visible and near-infrared spectroscopy that allows tissue absorption to be determined independently from tissue scattering, thereby allowing absolute measurements of chromophore concentrations, such as oxygenated and deoxygenated hemoglobins. More specifically, an SRS instrument may emit light into tissue through a light source and collect the diffusely reflected light at two or more detectors positioned at different distances from the light source.</p>
<p id="p-0043" num="0042">One field in which visible and near-infrared spectroscopy, such as SRS, is useful in tissue flap surgery in which a tissue flap is moved from one location on a patient to another location for reconstructive surgery. Visible and near-infrared spectroscopy techniques can be used to measure oxygen saturation in a tissue flap so that the viability of the tissue flap can be determined in surgery and after surgery. Intraoperative tissue flap oximetry probes that employ visible and near-infrared SRS should be able to quickly deliver accurate oxygen saturation measurements under a variety of non-ideal conditions.</p>

Nos. 13/887,130, 13/887,178, 13/887,213, and 13/887,220, filed May 3, 2013; 13/965,156, filed Aug. 12, 2013; Ser. No. 13/887,152, filed May 3, 2013; Ser.

No. 17/146,176, 17/146,182, 17/146,186, 17/146,190, 17/146,194, 17/146,197, and 17/146,201, filed Jan. 11, 2021. The implementations, embodiments, features, aspects, concepts, and ideas described in this patent can be combined with one or more implementations, embodiments, features, aspects, concepts, or ideas described in these references as well as other systems and techniques described elsewhere, in any order or combination.</p>
<p id="p-0045" num="0044">This patent describes some examples of implementations with specific dimensions, measurements, temperatures, values, percentages, and times. These are not intended to be exhaustive or to limit the invention to the precise form described. The specific dimensions, measurements, temperatures, values, percentages, and times are approximate values. These values can vary due to, for example, measurement or manufacturing variations or tolerances or other factors. For example, depending on the tightness of the manufacturing and measurement tolerances, the temperature and time values can vary plus or minus 2 percent, 2.5 percent, plus or minus 5 percent, plus or minus 7.5 percent, plus or minus 10 percent, plus or minus 12.5 percent, plus or minus 15 percent, plus or minus 20 percent, or plus or minus 25 percent, or other ranges.</p>
<p id="p-0046" num="0045">Further, the values are for a specific implementation, and other implementations can have different values, such as certain values made larger for a larger-scaled sized process or product, or smaller for a smaller-scaled process or product. A device, apparatus, or process may be made proportionally larger or smaller by adjusting relative measurements proportionally (e.g., maintaining the same or about the same ratio between different measurements). In various implementations, the values can be the same as the value given, about the same of the value given, at least or greater than the value given, or can be at most or less than the value given, or any combination of these.</p>
<p id="p-0047" num="0046">Some flow implementations are presented in this patent, but it should be understood that the invention is not limited to the specific flows and steps presented. A flow may have additional steps (not necessarily described in this application), different steps which replace some of the steps presented, fewer steps or a subset of the steps presented, or steps in a different order than presented, or any combination of these. Further, the steps in other implementations may not be exactly the same as the steps presented and may be modified or altered as appropriate for a particular application or based on the data.</p>
<p id="p-0048" num="0047">An implementation of the invention includes a probe, such as the described system unit or laparoscopic oximeter, and accompanying techniques to calculate and display an average oxygen saturation measurement of a number of previous measurements. The average measurement can be reset by the user by making a gesture with the probe. An example of a gesture is inverting the probe, relative to its standard operating orientation. And then after returning the probe to its standard operating orientation, the average value will be reset or initialized, and calculating of the average value will start at a count of 1. The instantaneous or instant oxygen saturation value can be displayed on the same screen as the average value, so that the user will be able to compare the oxygen saturation value with the average value of previous oxygen saturation measurements.</p>
<p id="p-0049" num="0048">An accelerometer integrated circuit or chip is used to detect gestures or motion of the probe. The probe can be an oximeter, such as a tissue oximeter or pulse oximeter, which makes oxygen saturation measurements. The probe can be a standalone probe, where the unit is self contained, and the oxygen saturation measurements and calculations to determine these measurements and the average values are contained within an enclosure of the standalone probe. Some components of the standalone probe include a processor, memory, display, signal emitters, light detectors, batteries (e.g., disposable or rechargeable), accelerometer, and others.</p>
<p id="p-0050" num="0049">In other implementations, the probe can be a connected wirelessly (e.g., Bluetooth or Wi-Fi) or wired to another device or unit (e.g., system unit, smartphone, or display console, or combination) or a number of devices or units, or to the cloud via a network or the Internet. The components and calculations can be divided among the connected devices or the cloud. For example, data from the probe can be transmitted to another device for determine of the oxygen saturation value and average saturation value, and then these value can be displayed on a screen separate from the probe. In such implementations, the components resident on the probe can be, for example, signal emitters, light detectors, the accelerometer (to detect gestures), and wireless or wired interface circuits; the processor and memory can be external to the probe. By removing some of the components, this would reduce the size and power consumption of the probe.</p>
<p id="p-0051" num="0050">Various data structures can be used to implement the oxygen saturation averaging feature. In an implementation, there is a first memory location to accumulate a sum of the previous instant oxygen saturation measurements and a second memory location to keep a count of the number of measurements made. The second memory location may be referred to as a counter. The second memory location can have a maximum value, and if the maximum value is achieved, then no further measurements will be added to the first memory location. And the average displayed on the screen will no longer change or update, even when further instant oxygen saturation measurement are made and displayed.</p>
<p id="p-0052" num="0051">Other data structures may be used to implement the oxygen saturation averaging feature, and more specifically a rolling or continuous moving average. For example, the instant oxygen saturation measurements may be stored in a queue data structure (e.g., implemented using an array or linked list structure). There can be a first memory location to keep a sum of the values in the queue, or the sum can be calculated by an arithmetic logic unit each time an average is desired. And another memory location will keep a count of the number of entries in the queue. The count may have a maximum value. And when that is achieved, the first oxygen saturation added to the queue will be removed (first-in, first-out or FIFO operation) and its value subtracted from sum memory location. The values in the queue will be moved back one location in the queue. And a current instant oxygen saturation measurement is added at an end of the queue. Other data structures and techniques can be used to implement a moving or rolling average.</p>

<p id="p-0056" num="0055"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b></figref> shows a block diagram of system unit <b>301</b>, in an implementation. The system unit includes a processor <b>304</b>, display <b>307</b>, speaker <b>309</b>, signal emitter <b>331</b>, signal detector <b>333</b>, volatile memory <b>312</b>, nonvolatile memory <b>315</b>, human interface device (HID) <b>319</b>, input-output (I/O) interface <b>322</b>, network interface <b>326</b>, latch detector <b>328</b>, temperature sensor <b>330</b>, and accelerometer <b>332</b>, in an implementation. These components are housed within housing <b>705</b>. Different implementations of the system may include any number of the components described, in any combination or configuration, and may also include other components not shown.</p>
<p id="p-0057" num="0056">The components are linked together via a bus <b>303</b>, which represents the system bus architecture of the system unit. Although <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b></figref> shows one bus that connects to each component of the system unit, bus <b>303</b> is illustrative of any interconnection scheme that links the components of the system unit. For example, one or more bus subsystems can interconnect one or more of the components of the system unit. Additionally, the bus subsystem may interconnect components through one or more ports, such as an audio port (e.g., a 2.5-millimeter or 3.5-millimeter audio jack port), a universal serial bus (USB) port, or another port. Components of the system unit may also be connected to the processor via direct connections, such as direct connections through a printed circuit board (PCB).</p>
<p id="p-0058" num="0057">In an implementation, system unit <b>301</b> includes a sensor probe <b>346</b>. The sensor probe includes a probe tip <b>338</b> and a connector <b>336</b>. The probe tip is connected to the connector via a first communication link <b>342</b> and a second communication link <b>344</b>. First communication link <b>342</b> may include an electrical wire, a set of electrical wires (e.g., a ribbon cable), a waveguide (e.g., fiber optic cables), a set of waveguides (e.g., a set of fiber optic cables), a wireless communication link, or any combination of these types of links. The second communication link may include an electrical wire, a set of electrical wires (e.g., a ribbon cable), a waveguide (e.g., a fiber optic cable), a set of waveguides (e.g., a set of fiber optic cables), a wireless communication link, or any combination of these types of links. The electrical wire or sets of electrical wires of the first communication link, the second communication link, or both can include one or more electrical traces on a printed circuit board.</p>
<p id="p-0059" num="0058">The connector connects (e.g., removably connects) the probe tip, the wires, waveguides, or any combination of these elements to the signal emitter and signal detector of the system unit. For example, a communication link <b>343</b> may connect the signal emitter to the connector and a communication link <b>345</b> may connect the signal detector to the connector. Each of the communication links <b>343</b> and <b>345</b> may include an electrical wire, a set of electrical wires (e.g., a ribbon cable) one waveguide, a set of waveguides, a wireless communication link, or any combination of these links. Each communication link can also include one or more electrical traces on a printed circuit board. For example, the connector may include one or more connectors that are mounted on a PCB. Communication links <b>342</b>, <b>344</b>, or either one of these links may be ribbon cables that connect to the probe tip and connect to connectors mounted on a PCB. In this implementation, communication links <b>343</b> and <b>345</b> can be electrical traces on the PCB that link to the single emitter, signal detector, or both. In this implementation, the signal emitters and signal detectors may be electrical emitters and detectors that control light emitters, light detectors, or both in the probe tip.</p>
<p id="p-0060" num="0059">In an implementation where the probe tip is separable from the system unit <b>301</b>, connector <b>336</b> may have a locking feature, such as an insert connector that may twist or screw to lock. If so, the connector is more securely held to the system unit and it will need to be unlocked before it can be removed. This will help prevent the accidental removal of the probe tip from the system unit.</p>
<p id="p-0061" num="0060">The connector may also have a first keying feature, so that the connector can only be inserted into a connector receptacle of the system unit in one or more specific orientations. This will ensure that proper connections are made.</p>
<p id="p-0062" num="0061">The connector may also have a second keying feature that provides an indication to the system unit that a type of probe (e.g., a probe from many different types of probes) that is attached. The system unit may be adapted to make measurements for a number of different types of probes. When a probe is inserted in the system unit, the system uses the second keying feature to determine the type of probe that is connected to the system unit. Then the system unit can perform the appropriate functions, use the appropriate algorithms, or otherwise make adjustments in its operation for the specific probe type.</p>
<p id="p-0063" num="0062">In an implementation, signal emitter <b>331</b> includes one or more light sources that emit light (visible light, infrared light, or both) at one or more specific wavelengths. In a specific implementation, the light sources emit five or more wavelengths of light (e.g., 730 nanometers, 760 nanometers, 810 nanometers, 845 nanometers, and 895 nanometers). Other wavelengths of light are emitted by the light sources, including shorter and longer wavelengths of light in other implementations. The signal emitter may include one or more laser diodes or one or more light emitting diodes (LEDs).</p>
<p id="p-0064" num="0063">In an implementation, signal emitter <b>331</b> is an emitter that emits electrical signals to one or more light sources, which may emit light based on the received electrical signals. In some implementations, the signal emitter includes one or more light sources and electrical signal emitters that are connected to the light sources.</p>
<p id="p-0065" num="0064">In an implementation, signal detector <b>333</b> includes one or more photodetectors capable of detecting the light at the wavelengths produced and emitted by the signal emitter. In another implementation, the signal detector <b>333</b> is an electrical signal detector that detects electrical signals generated by one or more photodetectors. In another implementation, the signal detector includes one or more photodetectors and one or more electrical detectors that are connected to the photodetectors.</p>
<p id="p-0066" num="0065">In an implementation, HID <b>319</b> is a device that is adapted to allow a user to input commands into the system unit. The HID may include one or more buttons, one or more slider devices, one or more accelerometers, a computer mouse, a keyboard, a touch interface device (e.g., a touch interface of display <b>307</b>), a voice interface device, or another HID.</p>
<p id="p-0067" num="0066">In an implementation where the HID is an accelerometer and the system unit is a handheld unit, the accelerometer may detect movements (e.g., gestures) of the system unit where the system unit may be moved by a user. Movements may include a left movement, right movement, forward movement, back movement, up movement, down movement, one or more rotational movements (e.g., about one or more axes of rotation, such as the x-axis, y-axis, z-axis, or another axis), any combinations of these movements, or other movements.</p>
<p id="p-0068" num="0067">Information for the various movements detected by the accelerometer may be transmitted to the processor to control one or more systems of the system unit. For example, an upward movement (e.g., a lifting movement) may be transmitted to the processor for powering on the system unit. Alternatively, if the system unit is set down and left unmoved for a predetermined period of time, then the processor may interpret the lack of movement detected by the accelerometer as a standby mode signal and may place the system unit in a standby power mode (a lower power mode than a normal operation mode where oximetry measurements can be made by the system unit), or a power-down signal and may power down the system unit.</p>
<p id="p-0069" num="0068">When the system unit is powered on, information for a left movement or a right movement detected by the accelerometer and transmitted to the processor may be used by the processor to control the system unit. For example, a left or right movement of the system unit may be used by the processor to change menu items displayed on the display. For example, the processor may use the information for a left movement to scroll menu items on the display to the left (e.g., scroll a first menu item left and off of the display to display a second menu item on the display). The processor may use the information for a right movement of the system unit to scroll menu items to the right (e.g., scroll a first menu item right and off of the display, and display a second menu item on the display).</p>
<p id="p-0070" num="0069">The HID and processor may be adapted to detect and use various movements to activate a menu item that is displayed on the display. For example, information for an upward movement or a downward movement may be detected and used to activate a menu item that is displayed on the display. For example, if a user is prepared to take an oximeter measurement and a menu option is displayed for taking an oximeter measurement, a quick downward movement of the system unit may start a measurement when the probe tip is placed in contact with tissue</p>
<p id="p-0071" num="0070">The HID may include one or more accelerometers to detect motion in various directions (e.g., linear, rotational, or both). The accelerometers can include one or more capacitive micro-electro-mechanical system (MEMS) devices, one or more piezoresistive devices, one or more piezoelectric devices, or any combination of these devices.</p>
<p id="p-0072" num="0071">In an embodiment, accelerometer <b>332</b> is adapted to detect relatively high G-force accelerations associated with a shock that the system unit experiences. The shock may be from bumping the system into something, dropping the system unit (e.g., dropping the system unit on a table or the floor), or other shock events. In an implementation, if the accelerometer indicates to the processor that a shock event has occurred, the processor can take a number of actions. For example, the processor can shut down the system unit. The processor can display one or more messages on the display. The messages may indicate that the system unit should be recalibrated. The message may indicate that contact between the system unit and the sheath should be checked. The accelerometer may include one or more capacitive micro-electro-mechanical system (MEMS) devices, one or more piezoresistive devices, one or more piezoelectric devices, or any combination of these devices.</p>
<p id="p-0073" num="0072">The nonvolatile memory <b>315</b> may include a FLASH memory, other nonvolatile solid-state storage (e.g., USB flash drive), battery-backed-up volatile memory, tape storage, reader, and other similar media, and combinations of these. In some implementations, the nonvolatile memory includes a mass disk drive, magnetic disks, optical disks, magneto-optical disks, fixed disks, hard disks, CD-ROMs, recordable CDs, DVDs, recordable DVDs (e.g., DVD-R, DVD+R, DVD-RW, DVD+RW, HD-DVD, or Blu-ray Disc). The volatile memory may include a random access memory (RAM).</p>
<p id="p-0074" num="0073">The processor may include a microcontroller, a microprocessor, an application specific integrated circuit (ASIC), programmable logic (e.g., field programmable gate array), or any combination of these circuits, such as a microprocessor and an FPGA or a microcontroller and an FPGA.

A computer-readable medium may include any medium that participates in providing instructions to one or more processors for execution. Such a medium may take many forms, including but not limited to, nonvolatile, volatile, and transmission media. Nonvolatile media includes, for example, flash memory, or optical or magnetic disks. Volatile media includes static or dynamic memory, such as cache memory or RAM. Transmission media includes coaxial cables, copper wire, fiber optic lines, and wires arranged in a bus. Transmission media can also take the form of electromagnetic, radio frequency, acoustic, or light waves, such as those generated during radio wave and infrared data communications.</p>

<p id="p-0087" num="0086">Block <b>351</b> shows a power block of the system unit having both AC and battery power options. In an implementation, the system includes an AC-to-DC converter <b>353</b>, such as a full-wave rectifier. The converter takes AC power from a wall socket, converts AC power to DC power, and the DC output is connected (indicated by an arrow <b>354</b>) to the components of the system unit needing power.</p>
<p id="p-0088" num="0087">In an implementation, the system unit is battery operated.

The batteries may be rechargeable or disposable batteries. The block may not include the AC-to-DC converter. Block <b>351</b> may be a block that is integrated with the system unit or is separable from the system unit.</p>
<p id="p-0090" num="0089"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>7</b></figref> shows block <b>651</b> that is a power block that is usable with the system unit, in an implementation.

<p id="p-0091" num="0090">Battery monitor <b>617</b> may be connected to the battery cells <b>356</b> and may monitor the capability of the battery cells. For example, the battery monitor may determine a current charge state, such as a percentage of the total possible charge. The battery monitor may determine the charge capacity of the battery cells. The charge capacity may be a percentage of the charge capacity compared to the charge capacity of the battery cells when new. The battery monitor may determine the maximum power delivery capability of the battery.</p>
<p id="p-0092" num="0091">The battery cells may be disposable battery cells, such as alkaline battery cells, or rechargeable battery cells, such as nickel-metal hydride, lithium battery cells (e.g., Li/FeS2 size AA, AAA, N, CR123, 18650, or others), lithium polymer, or other types of cells. The power back may include four battery cells that are AA size cells that output 1.5 volts. The four batteries may be in series to output 6 volts, or may be in series and parallel to output 3 volts.</p>
<p id="p-0093" num="0092">Voltage regulator circuit <b>619</b> may be connected between the battery cells and the power port of the battery interface <b>612</b>. The voltage regulator circuit conditions the voltage output from the battery to output an approximately constant voltage. The voltage regular circuit may also include a DC-to-DC converter that converts a first voltage output from the battery cells to a second voltage that is different from the first voltage.</p>
<p id="p-0094" num="0093">The timing circuit is a circuit that determines the amount of time length that the battery has been used. Information for the amount of time may be stored in the memory and may be transferred through the data port to the processor when the processor queries the memory for the information.</p>
<p id="p-0095" num="0094">In an embodiment, the memory may also store an encrypted identifier that identifies the power block. The processor may be adapted to retrieve the encrypted identifier via the power blocks data port. The processor or another decryption circuit of the system unit may decrypt the encrypted identifier and may identify the power block based on the identifier after decryption. The identifier may identify the manufacturer of the power block or may identify other information about the power block, such as the manufacturing date, the battery cell type, battery cell voltage, elapsed usage time, or any combination of these elements. In an implementation, if the identifier is not a known identifier that is known to the system unit, then the processor with not allow the system unit to operate with the power block. That is, the system unit will not operate with a power block manufactured by an unknown manufacturer.</p>
<p id="p-0096" num="0095">Allowing the system unit to operate with known (e.g., authorized) power blocks, the system unit is assured that the power provided by the power block is within the operating specifications of the system unit. Therefore, the circuits, signal emitters, signal detectors, and other elements of the system unit will operate within predetermined parameters and will not operate outside of the predetermined parameters. Also, using a known battery from a known manufacturer provides that the stem unit will operate for a known period of time so that the system unit will not run out of battery power during a medical procedure, such as a surgery. Operating the system unit according to predetermined parameters, facilitates the system unit making accurate and reliable oximetry measurements.</p>
<p id="p-0097" num="0096">In an implementation, nonvolatile memory <b>315</b> stores one or more identifiers for one or more power blocks that may operate with the system unit. The processor may compare the identifier for the power pack that has been decrypted to the one or more identifiers retrieved from the nonvolatile memory to determine whether the power block will be allowed to operate with the system unit. If the power block is not authorized for use with the system unit, the processor may cause a message to be displayed on the display that indicates that the power block is not authorized for use with the system unit. If the power block is authorized to operate with the system unit, then the system unit may operate to make oximetry measurements without displaying information on the display about the authenticity or the inauthenticity of the power block.</p>
<p id="p-0098" num="0097">In an implementation, the memory of the power block stores an indicator that indicates whether the battery has been previously used. The indicator may be the time information for the amount of time that the power block has operated. A nonzero use time stored in the memory is an indicator that the power block has been previously used. Alternatively, the indicator may be an identifier of a system unit that the power block has been connected to and provided power to. For example, the nonvolatile memory of the system unit may store an identifier of a system unit. The processor of the system unit may transfer the system identifier of the system unit to the power block for storage in the power block's memory. In an implementation, the system unit tests the battery use by a threshold that is greater than zero (e.g., usage number stored in the battery's memory), to handle the case of someone accidentally disconnecting the battery before insertion into the sheath. If the system unit checked a usage of zero versus nonzero, then the battery would be rejected for use for the accidental battery disconnection situation. A threshold greater than zero allows for the system unit test to not interrupt the workflow of connecting the battery and placing the battery in the sheath. That is, the implementation attempts to ensure that a power block is fully charged and can be used for the duration of a medical procedure (e.g., a surgery) without the power block running out of stored energy. Ensuring that a power block is unused prior to using the power block during a medical procedure provides that the power block will not run out of power during the procedure and minimize risk to a patient. That is, patient risk is lowered if a system unit used during a procedure does not run out of power and can be used for patient monitoring when required.</p>
<p id="p-0099" num="0098">In an implementation, when the power block is attached to a system unit, the processor of the system unit may query the power block's memory to retrieve the time information for the amount of time that the power block has operated. In an implementation, if the system unit determines that the power block has been previously used based on the time information, then the system unit will not operate with the power block. Similar to the embodiment described immediately above, ensuring that a power block is unused prior to using the power block during a medical procedure provides that the power block will not run out of power during the procedure and minimize risk to a patient.</p>
<p id="p-0100" num="0099">When the power block is attached to a system unit, the processor of the system unit may query the power block's memory to retrieve any system identifier that may be stored in the power block's memory. In an implementation, if a system identifier retrieved from the power block's memory is different from the system identifier of the system unit that is retrieved the system unit from the power block's memory, then the system unit will not operate with the power block.</p>
<p id="p-0101" num="0100">The power block may include one more magnets <b>614</b> that are arranged in an arrangement, such as a square, a rectangular, or another arrangement. A system unit may also have one or more magnets or one or more metal plates (e.g., ferromagnetic plates) that are arranged in an arrangement that is complementary to the arrangement of magnets in the power block. The magnets of the power block may attract the magnets or metal plates of the system unit when the power block is placed in contact with the system unit. The magnetic attraction between the magnets or plates may hold the power block in place when the system unit is being used.</p>
<p id="p-0102" num="0101">The power block may include one more plates (e.g., ferromagnetic plates) that are arranged in an arrangement, such as square, rectangular, or another arrangement. The system unit may include one or more magnets that are arranged in a complementary arrangement. The magnets of the system unit may magnetically attract the metal plates of the power block when the power block is placed in contact with the system unit. The magnetic attraction between the magnets and plates may hold the power block in place when the system unit is being used.</p>
<p id="p-0103" num="0102">In an implementation, the power port of the power block includes at least two electrical contacts (e.g., a power contact and a ground contact) and the data port includes at least two electrical contacts (e.g., a data line and a shared ground contact with the power port). The electrical contacts are arranged in an arrangement, such as in a row, in a square, in a rectangle, or in another arrangement. The system unit includes a power port that includes at least two electrical contacts (e.g., a power contact and a ground contact) and includes a data port that includes at least two electrical contacts (e.g., a data line and a shared ground contact with the power port). The arrangement of the electrical contacts is complementary to the electrical contacts of the power block.</p>
<p id="p-0104" num="0103">When the power block is placed in contact with the system unit, the magnetic attraction between the magnets or between the magnets and metal plates forces the electrical contacts of the power port in the system unit into contact with the electrical contacts of the power port of the power block. Also, the magnetic attraction forces the electrical contacts of the data port in the system unit into contact with the electrical contacts of the data port of the power block. As such, electrical power can be transferred from the power block to the system unit to power the circuits and other elements of the system unit, and data can be transferred between the power block and the system unit.</p>
<p id="p-0105" num="0104">In an implementation, the system unit performs oximetry readings of patient tissue and generates an average oximetry value from a number of the oximetry readings of the patient tissue. The system unit can display the average oximetry value on the display of the system unit. The system unit can perform oximetry readings of tissue and display the oximetry values for the reading while the system unit is located in a sheath or not located in the sheath. Sheath implementations usable with the system unit are described below with respect to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>8</b>-<b>12</b></figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0106" num="0105">One or more of the oximetry readings may be for a single tissue site of a patient, different tissue sites of a patient, or a combination of these tissue sites. The averaging function performed by the system unit allows the system unit to remember oximetry reading values, such as oxygen saturation (i.e., StO2), absorption coefficient, or other oximetry reading values, and generate an average oximetry value for some or all of the remembered oximetry reading values. The oximetry reading values that are displayed on the display can include one or more oximetry reading values (e.g., oxygen saturation values) included in an average of the oximetry reading values, an average of the oximetry reading values (e.g., an average oxygen saturation value), any combination of these values, or any combination of these values can be weighted by a quality metric value. A quality metric value can be an indicator of the quality of contact of eh probe face of the system unit to tissue, the sheath to tissue, and thus an indicator of the quality of the oximeter reading values. The system unit can assess quality, for example, of contact of the probe face or sheath to the tissue, a quality of the tissue, or both, and generate a quality metric value based on one or both of these assessments</p>
<p id="p-0107" num="0106">In an implementation, the processor of the system unit makes oximetry readings of patient tissue at a measurement frequency of between about 0.2 hertz and about 10 hertz (e.g., about 0.5 hertz to about 6 hertz). The measurement frequency of oximetry readings performed by the system unit may vary by 0 percent, plus or minus 0.5 percent, plus or minus 1 percent, plus or minus 1.5 percent, plus or minus 2 percent, or other values as will be understood by those of skill in the art.</p>
<p id="p-0108" num="0107">In an implementation, oximetry reading values that are displayed on the display of the system unit are updated on the display at a frequency that is less than the measurement frequency. For example, the system unit may display oximetry reading values for oxygen saturation of patient tissue no more often than about once per second to no more than about once per every three seconds, such as about no more than once per every two seconds. That is, about every two seconds or less, the system unit displays a newly measured oxygen saturation value on the display of the system unit.</p>

The sheath can accept the system unit into an interior space of the sheath so that the system unit is sealed in the sheath. The system unit can be sealed in the sheath so that contaminants on tissue do not contact the system unit so that the system unit can be reused. Additionally, the system unit can be sealed in the sheath so that contaminants on the system unit do not contact patient tissue. The system unit sealed in the sheath also allows the system unit to be entered into the sterile field of an operating room without contaminating the sterile field. The sheath includes a body <b>220</b> and a hinged lid <b>215</b> with a window through which the display of the system unit is visible when the system unit is enclosed in the sheath with the lid closed and sealed in by a seal <b>210</b> and a latch <b>216</b>.

An O-ring <b>1405</b> is shown in the recess. The lid can also include an O-ring recess <b>4110</b> on the bottom of the lid. The O-ring recesses of the body and lid can contact the O-ring when the lid is closed against the body. The O-ring can form a seal that seals the lib to the body so that contaminants cannot enter the seal between the lid and body. The system unit can be inserted into the sheath or removed from the sheath through the top opening of body <b>220</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0111" num="0110"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>9</b></figref> additionally shows the second sheath window <b>218</b> at the bottom of the body of the sheath. The second sheath window may generally be round from an end view. In a specific implementation, the second sheath window is circular.

<p id="p-0113" num="0112"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>11</b></figref> shows a perspective view of the sheath where the system unit and power block are located in the sheath with the lid of the sheath in a closed position. The display of the system unit is visible through the first window of the lid of the sheath. Information (e.g., text, graphics, or both) that is displayed on the display of the system unit is visible to a user looking through the second window of the lid. The display and window are both proximally located with the probe face and second window distally located when the system is ready for use. With the second window in contact with tissue, the display faces away from the tissue so that the display, through the first window, can be seen by a user.</p>
<p id="p-0114" num="0113"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>12</b>-<b>15</b></figref> show the display <b>307</b> of the system unit <b>301</b>, in an implementation. The display can display a number of pieces of information generated by the system unit. For example, the display can display oximetry information <b>1900</b>, a number of permitted uses <b>1905</b> of the system unit that remain and a number of uses <b>1910</b> of the system unit that are available for a new unused system unit, a quality metric <b>1915</b>, an indicator <b>1920</b> for an amount of available battery power in the battery, and a use message <b>1925</b>. The oximetry information <b>1900</b> may include one or more of an oxygen saturation value (i.e., StO2), an oxygenated hemoglobin percentage (i.e., a saturated hemoglobin percentage), a deoxygenated hemoglobin percentage (i.e., an unsaturated hemoglobin percentage), an absorption coefficient, or other measured values. The total number of uses of the system unit may be from 5 to 100. In a specific implementation, the total number of uses of the system unit is 25. In the example shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>12</b></figref>, the system unit has been used 2 times and 23 remaining uses are permitted by the system unit. The quality metric <b>1915</b> is a quality indicator for the displayed oximetry information <b>1900</b>. The quality metric in the displayed embodiment is a bar graph. The battery power indicator <b>1920</b> may be a bar graph, a highlighted-dehighlighted graph, or other type of indicator. In the implementation shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>12</b></figref>, the battery power indicator is a bar graph imposed with an image of a battery.</p>
<p id="p-0115" num="0114">The use message (e.g., &#x201c;lift up,&#x201d; &#x201c;lift,&#x201d; or another message) may be a message for an action (e.g., lift the sheath or system unit if the system unit is used without a sheath) that a user may take so that the system unit will generate an average for a number of oximetry values that are generated by the system unit. The oximetry values can be any of the examples of the oximetry information <b>2100</b> described above, such as an oxygen saturation value. The average can be for a single tissue location of a patient or a number of tissue locations for the patient.</p>
<p id="p-0116" num="0115">After the system unit has taken a first oximetry measurement and displays a first oximetry information <b>1900</b> on the display, the system unit may then display the use message. The use message may indicate that the user should &#x201c;lift up&#x201d; the system unit so that the second window <b>218</b> of the sheath or the probe face of the probe tip <b>338</b> of the system unit is not in contact with the tissue being measured. The probe face of the probe tip of the system unit may be in contact with the patient tissue if the system unit is used without the sheath.</p>
<p id="p-0117" num="0116">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>14</b></figref>, after the system unit is lifted by the user and the second window or the probe face is not in contact with the tissue, the display may stop displaying oximetry information <b>1900</b> and display two bars <b>1903</b> or other information, such as another icon. When the bars are displayed the user can place the second window of the sheath or the probe face of the system unit back into contact with the tissue. The location on the tissue that the second window or probe face is placed in contact with can be the same tissue location that the system unit was lifted from or can be a different location. The system unit will thereafter generate second oximetry information (e.g., second oxygen saturation information for the tissue) for the second placement of the sheath, system unit, or both.</p>
<p id="p-0118" num="0117">In an implementation, when the system unit is removed from contact with the tissue, the oximetry values for oximetry measurements may be greater than a first threshold value or less than second threshold value. The processor can determine that the system unit has been removed from contact with the tissue when one or more oximetry values are greater or less than the first and second threshold values, respectively. The first and second threshold values can be the same value. The oximetry values for when the system unit is in contact with the tissue may be values that are less than the first oximetry value and greater than the second threshold value.</p>
<p id="p-0119" num="0118">In another implementation, when the system unit is removed from contact with the tissue, the oximetry values for oximetry measurements may be less than a first threshold value or greater than second threshold value. The processor can determine that the system unit has been removed from contact with the tissue when one or more oximetry values are less than or greater than the first and second threshold values, respectively. The first and second threshold values can be the same value. The oximetry values for when the system unit is in contact with the tissue may be values that are greater than the first oximetry value and less than the second threshold value. The two above describe implementations may differ based on how the system unit implements logic for how the oximetry values are reported.</p>
<p id="p-0120" num="0119">The display of the system unit may continue to display the two bars <b>1903</b> when the second oximetry information is generated or may display the second oximetry information (e.g., second oxygen saturation information). The system unit may also display that there is one average generated <b>1930</b> for the first and second oximetry information (e.g., &#x201c;Avg 1: &#x2014;%&#x201d;) for the first and second placements on the tissue. In an implementation, for the tissue location, the system unit does not display an average value, but displays other information, such as an icon (e.g., two bars). In an implementation, the first oximetry information for a first tissue location is displayed on the display in the location where averages are displayed, it being understood that a single oximetry measurement for a single tissue location is not an average for a number of tissue locations (e.g., greater than two tissue locations).</p>
<p id="p-0121" num="0120">After the second oximetry information is generated, the display may again display the use message (e.g., &#x201c;lift up&#x201d;). Thereafter the process of lifting and placing the sheath or probe face of the system unit onto the tissue (e.g., at the same tissue location or a different tissue location) may be repeated. Thereafter, the system unit may generate third oximetry information for the tissue on which the second window or probe face is placed. In an implementation, the system unit displays an average value when a third average value of the oximetry information is generated. That is, the average of the first, second, and third oximetry information is referred to as the third average value. In other implementations, the system unit displays an average value when a second average value of oximetry information is generated or a higher number of average values of the oximetry information is generated.</p>
<p id="p-0122" num="0121">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>15</b></figref>, the third average value for the oximetry information is displayed on the display. After the third oximetry information is generated, the use message may be displayed for each subsequent oximetry information generated (e.g., fourth, fifth, sixth, seventh, or more) and an average may be generated and displayed.</p>
<p id="p-0123" num="0122">In an implementation, the average is no longer accumulated after a fixed number (e.g., nine) of averages are generated. In an implementation, the average is reset if the accelerometer detects that the system unit is turned upside down (i.e., inverted). In another implementation, the number of oximetry measurements (e.g., oxygen saturation values) that are included in an average is not capped to a fixed number of generated average values and the average continues to be generated when the conditions for a valid oximetry measurement is made (e.g., lift up is displayed on the display and the system unit is lifted when lift up is displayed on the display) for an oximetry measurement that is to be included into the average value. That is, if the system unit is rotated vertically by about 180 degrees+/&#x2212;about 45 degrees the average will be reset.</p>
<p id="p-0124" num="0123"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>16</b></figref> is a flow diagram of a method of operation of the system unit for generating average oximetry information, in an implementation. The flow diagram shows an example embodiment in an implementation. Steps may be added, removed, or combined without deviating from the method.</p>
<p id="p-0125" num="0124">At <b>2300</b>, at an initial state of the method, no oximetry measurements (i.e., &#x201c;average count&#x201d;) have been made for tissue to be measured of a single patient. For each tissue location that oximetry measurements are made, the average count may be incremented by one if a set of lift and place rules of the system unit are satisfied or may remain unchanged if the set lift and place rules are not satisfied. For example, if the set of rules are satisfied for a first tissue location, then the average count is one. If the set of rules are satisfied for a second tissue location, then the average count is incremented by one and is two. If the set of rules are satisfied for a third tissue location, then the average count is incremented by one and is three. If the set of rules are satisfied for a fourth tissue location, then the average count is incremented by one and is four. If the set of rules are satisfied for a fifth tissue location, then the average count is incremented by one and is five. If the set of rules are satisfied for a sixth tissue location, then the average count is incremented by one and is six. This process of incrementing the average count continues to increment by one for each subsequent tissue location that the system unit is placed at if the set of rules is satisfied.</p>
<p id="p-0126" num="0125">If the lift and place rules are not satisfied, for example, for the third tissue location, then the average count is not incremented by one, and the average count may remain at two. The lift and placement rules used by the system unit to increment the average count or not increment the average count are described with respect to the following steps of the method.</p>
<p id="p-0127" num="0126">In an embodiment, the values for the average count are stored in a memory (e.g., a buffer memory) of the system. The stored value for the average count is incremented when the lift and place set of rules are satisfied for tissue oximetry measurements for the tissue locations of the patient tissue of the select patient.</p>
<p id="p-0128" num="0127">At <b>2305</b>, the system unit interrogates the memory (e.g., the buffer memory) of the system unit to determine whether the average count is greater than or equal to three. If the average count is greater than or equal to three, then oximetry measurements have been made for three tissue locations of the patient tissue and the lift and place rules have been satisfied for the measurements made by the system unit. If the average count is less than three, then oximetry measurements have not been made for three tissue locations of the patient tissue and, lift and place rules have been satisfied for the measurements made by the system unit, or both.</p>
<p id="p-0129" num="0128">At <b>2305</b>, if the average count is greater than or equal to three (e.g., interrogate the memory that stores the average count), then at <b>2310</b> the display of the system unit displays the current average count and average information for the oximetry measurements (e.g., average oxygen saturation measurements) for the tissue locations. More specifically, the system unit may display &#x201c;Avg N, M %&#x201d; (see <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>15</b></figref> on the display, where N is the current average count and M is the average of the oximetry measurements. The average is calculated as the sum of the oximetry measurements divided by the average count. In alternative implementations, the average is calculated by other techniques.</p>
<p id="p-0130" num="0129">At <b>2305</b>, if the average count is less than three, then at <b>2315</b>, the system unit determines whether the average count is equal to zero.</p>
<p id="p-0131" num="0130">At <b>2315</b>, if the average count is zero, then at <b>2320</b>, the system unit does not display oximetry information on the display.</p>
<p id="p-0132" num="0131">At <b>2315</b>, if the average count is greater than zero, then at <b>2325</b>, the system unit displays the current average count and no average information for the oximetry measurements. For example, the system unit may display &#x201c;Avg N, --%&#x201d; (see <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>14</b></figref>) on the display, where N is the average count and the dashes indicate that no average information for the oximetry information is displayed. The display may display the two dashes or other text or another icon to indicate that no average for the oximetry measurement is displayed.</p>
<p id="p-0133" num="0132">At <b>2330</b>, the system unit makes one or more oximetry measurements for a tissue location. If the system unit is executing the method for a first time, the tissue location is a first tissue location. If the system unit is executing the method for a second time, the tissue location may be a second tissue location. If the system unit is executing the method for a third time, the tissue location may be a third tissue location. The tissue locations increase as the method continues to be executed (loop through the loop portions of the method). The system unit determines whether the sheath or system unit (e.g., system unit used without the sheath) contacts the tissue and whether the oximetry information (e.g., oxygen saturation information) for the oximetry measurement is valid oximetry information. The system unit will display the oximetry information if the oximetry information is valid oximetry information.</p>
<p id="p-0134" num="0133">At <b>2330</b>, if the sheath or system unit is not in contact with the tissue, if the oximetry information is not valid, or both, then the method return to step <b>2305</b> and repeats the described steps until the method is terminated, such as by inversion of the system unit described below with respect to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>21</b> and <b>22</b>A-<b>22</b>B</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0135" num="0134">At <b>2330</b>, if the sheath or system unit is in contact with the tissue, if the oximetry information is valid, or both, then at <b>2335</b>, the system unit determines whether this state (e.g., if the sheath or system unit is in contact with the tissue, if the oximetry information is valid, or both) has persisted for at least three display update cycles. The display may update the oximetry information that is displayed on the display after one update cycle that has a threshold cycle time. The threshold cycle time may be from about 1 second to about 3 seconds, from about 2 seconds and 4 seconds, or another duration. In an implementation, the threshold cycle time is from about 2 seconds to 2.3 seconds. Thus, three update cycle times may be from about 3 seconds to about 9 seconds, about 6 seconds to about 12 seconds, or another duration. In the specific embodiment, three update cycles may be about 6 seconds.</p>
<p id="p-0136" num="0135">At <b>2335</b>, if the state (e.g., if the sheath or system unit is in contact with the tissue, if the oximetry information is valid, or both) has not persisted for at least three display update cycles, then the system unit continues to make oximetry measurements for the tissue location at <b>2330</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0137" num="0136">At <b>2340</b>, if the state (e.g., if the sheath or system unit is in contact with the tissue, if the oximetry information is valid, or both) has persisted for at least three display update cycles, then the system unit displays a use message (e.g., a &#x201c;lift up&#x201d; message) on the display at <b>2340</b>. The use message informs the user that the user has to take a specific action with the system unit so that the system unit can accumulate an average of oximetry measurements.</p>
<p id="p-0138" num="0137">At <b>2345</b>, the system unit determines whether the sheath or system unit has been lifted, such as if the system unit has been lifted out of contact with the tissue.</p>
<p id="p-0139" num="0138">In an implementation, the lift is detected by determining that measured oximetry information is no longer valid for the patient tissue. Invalid oximetry information may be outside of a range of predetermined valid oximetry information. Invalid oximetry information may include an oxygen saturation measurement that provides an invalid result, for example, from extreme property predictions, a poor fit of measured values to a lookup database of stored Monte Carlo simulated reflectance curves, ambient light saturation (e.g., when the system unit is lifted from tissue, or other factors.</p>
<p id="p-0140" num="0139">When the system unit detects that a lift has occurred, the system unit determines whether the lift occurred when the lift up message was displayed on the display. The system unit may store oximetry information in a memory location in which the average oximetry information is stored. The system unit may also store information (e.g., the average count) for the number of times oximetry information is stored for the average oximetry information.</p>
<p id="p-0141" num="0140">At <b>2345</b>, if the system unit has not been removed from the tissue, has been removed from the tissue when the use message is not displayed, or both, then the lift message is displayed at <b>2340</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0142" num="0141">At <b>2345</b>, if the system unit has been removed from the tissue, has been removed from the tissue when the use message is displayed, or both, then at <b>2350</b> the average count is incremented by one. The average for the oximetry information (e.g., oxygen saturation value) is generated for the tissue locations. The incremented average count and the average oximetry information is displayed on the display. Thereafter, the flow of the method repeats at <b>2305</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0143" num="0142">Table A below shows information that is used by the system unit to generate an average for oximetry information, in an implementation. The table shows a number of oximetry measurements that may be made when the sheath or system unit is placed in contact with various locations on a patient's tissue. The values of Table A may be generated according to the method described above with respect to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>16</b></figref> and alternatives of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>16</b></figref> also described above.</p>
<p id="p-0144" num="0143">The first column in the table, labeled &#x201c;Number of measurements included in an average,&#x201d; shows the number of times the sheath or system unit has been removed from the tissue while the user message (e.g., &#x201c;lift up&#x201d;) is displayed on the display. For example, the number 1 entry in the first column of the table may be for an initial lift up of the sheath or system unit for a first tissue location for a new average. The number 2 entry in the first column of the table may be for a lift up of the sheath or system unit from a second tissue location when the sheath or system unit has been lifted from the first tissue location and lifted from the second tissue location. The number 3 entry in the first column of the table may be for a third lift up of the sheath or system unit from a third tissue location when the sheath or system unit has been lifted from the second tissue location and lifted from the third tissue location. The number 4 entry in the first column of the table may be for a fourth lift up of the sheath or system unit from a fourth tissue location when the sheath or system unit has been lifted from the third tissue location and lifted from the fourth tissue location.</p>
<p id="p-0145" num="0144">The second column in the table, labeled &#x201c;Oximentry measurements during a placement of the sheath and system unit at a tissue location,&#x201d; shows a number of pieces of oximetry information (e.g., oxygen saturation values) that are generated when the sheath or system unit is placed at a location on a patient's tissue. For example, the first row of oximetry information of the second column shows six values (e.g., 27, 50, 74, 66, 79, 72) for oximetry information generated by the system unit for the first tissue location. The second row of oximetry information of the second column shows four values (e.g., 62, 71, 77, 68) for oximetry information generated by the system unit for the second tissue location. The second tissue location is the location where the second window of the sheath or the probe face of the system unit is placed after being lifted from the first tissue location. The third row of oximetry information in the second column shows five values (e.g., 0, 0, 64, 73, 70) for oximetry information generated by the system unit for the third tissue location. The third tissue location is the location where the second window of the sheath or the probe face of the system unit is placed after being lifted from the second tissue location. The fourth row of oximetry information in the second column shows four values (e.g., 0, 0, 64, 73, 70) for oximetry information generated by the system unit for the fourth tissue location. The fourth tissue location is the location where the second window of the sheath or the probe face of the system unit is placed after being lifted from the third tissue location.</p>
<p id="p-0146" num="0145">The last piece of oximetry information generated for each of the tissue locations is used by the system unit to generate an average of the oximetry information. For example, the third column, labeled &#x201c;Measurements used for average,&#x201d; of the table shows the measurements that are used for generating an average. The first data row of the third column includes the value 72 for the oximetry information. This value is the last piece of oximetry information (e.g., 72) generated by the system unit for the first tissue location, which is shown in the second column of the table.</p>
<p id="p-0147" num="0146">The second data row of the third column includes the value 68 for the oximetry information. This value is the last piece of oximetry information (e.g., 68) generated by the system unit for the second tissue location, which is shown in the second column of the table.</p>
<p id="p-0148" num="0147">The third data row of the third column includes the value 70 for the oximetry information. This value is the last piece of oximetry information (e.g., 70) generated by the system unit for the third tissue location, which is shown in the second column of the table. The fourth data row of the third column includes the value 74 for the oximetry information. This value is the last piece of oximetry information (e.g., 74) generated by the system unit for the fourth tissue location, which is shown in the second column of the table.</p>
<p id="p-0149" num="0148">The fourth column in the table shows average values that may be displayed on the display of the system unit. In an implementation, an average value for the first and second tissue locations is not shown on the display. In an implementation, an average value for the first tissue location is not shown on the display, while an average for a second or higher number of tissue locations is displayed on the display. As described above, the display may display dashed lines or another icon for the average value for the first and second tissue locations. When the average values are generated for the third tissue location or a higher number tissue location, these average values may be displayed on the display.</p>

<p id="p-0151" num="0149">In an implementation, the system unit stores the values in two or more of the columns.

For example, after the measurements of the first tissue location are made, the system unit may store the value 72. After the measurements for the first and second tissue locations are made, the system unit may store the sum (e.g., 140) of the first and second values (e.g., 72 and 68) of the third column. After the measurements for the first, second, and third tissue locations are made, the system unit may store the sum (e.g., 210) of the first, second, and third values (e.g., 72, 68, and 70) of the third column. After the measurements for the first, second, third, and fourth tissue locations are made, the system unit may store the sum (e.g., 284) of the first, second, and third values (e.g., 72, 68, 70, and 74) of the third column.

For the reset to occur, the system unit can be vertically rotated where the display of the system unit is rotated down as the probe face of the system unit is rotated up. That is, the system unit can be rotated vertically as indicated by arrows <b>1830</b> in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>11</b></figref>. The rotation can be about any horizontal axis <b>1820</b> that is perpendicular to vertical axis <b>1810</b>. Vertical axis can <b>1810</b> extends through the probe face of the system unit and the display of the system unit.</p>
<p id="p-0153" num="0151"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>22</b>A</figref> shows the system unit with the top housing <b>2905</b> separated from the bottom housing <b>2910</b>. In an embodiment, the vertical axis <b>1810</b> is parallel to a surface of a printed circuit board (PCB) <b>2920</b> that is located in the system unit. The surface of the PCB is the surface on which the accelerometer circuit <b>2930</b> and other circuits of the system unit are mounted. The PCB is approximately parallel to a back surface of the bottom housing, which the PCB is mounted on.</p>
<p id="p-0154" num="0152">The accelerometer can be an integrated circuit (IC), in an implementation, where the accelerometer is mounted on PCB <b>2920</b>. The accelerometer can be mounted on the top surface of the PCB as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>22</b>A</figref> or can be mounted on the bottom surface of the PCB. The accelerometer IC can be mounted on a PCB with a number of support circuits where the PCB is mounted on PCB <b>2920</b>. The accelerometer is a three-axis accelerometer, in one implementation. The accelerometer is a two axis accelerometer, in another implementation. The accelerometer can include two, two axis accelerometers, in an implementation.</p>
<p id="p-0155" num="0153">In an implementation where the accelerometer is a three axis accelerometer, the z-axis of the accelerometer is perpendicular to the top surface of PCB <b>2920</b> and extends upward from the top surface of the PCB as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>22</b></figref>. That is, the z-axis extends towards the top housing and the display of the system unit. The z-axis can extend towards bottom housing <b>1810</b>, such as in an implementation where the accelerometer is mounted on the bottom surface of PCB <b>2920</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0156" num="0154">The y-axis of the accelerometer extends along a vertical axis <b>1810</b> of the accelerometer or is parallel to vertical axis <b>1810</b>. The y-axis can extend through the probe face of the sensor head or adjacent to the probe face.</p>
<p id="p-0157" num="0155">In an implementation, the x-, y-, and z-axis are oriented in directions other than described above, such as the y-axis not being parallel to the to vertical axis <b>1810</b> or the z-axis not extending toward the bottom housing and where the processor is configured to use one or more axis and mathematical calculation (e.g., trigonometry) to determine when the system unit is rotated, such as being rotated with respect to the acceleration of gravity vector. Those of skill in the art will understand the use of mathematical calculations for determining such rotations when the axis of the accelerometer are oriented in a variety of directions.</p>
<p id="p-0158" num="0156">The x-axis of the accelerometer extends to the left when the top housing is viewed from the front or when the front surface of PCB <b>2920</b> is viewed as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>22</b></figref>. The x-axis can extend to the right when the accelerometer is mounted on the back surface of PCB <b>2920</b>. The three axes of the accelerometer can be indicated on the IC packaging, on the PCB, or both. The axes can be indicated by arrows, a first mark (e.g., circle with a cross inside the circle) that indicates that an axis is extending into the PCB, or a second mark (e.g., circle with a dot inside the circle) indicating an axis is extending upward from the PCB. In an implementation, the accelerometer is manufactured by NXP Semiconductors N.V. of Austin Tex. and is a model MMA8452QR1.</p>
<p id="p-0159" num="0157"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>22</b>B</figref> shows a diagram of an accelerometer MMA8452QR1. The accelerometer is configured to provide serial data output (SDA) for determined accelerations. The accelerometer is a clocked device (SCL) that is configured for clocking data out of the serial data output. The device is configured to allow for an interrupt (INT<b>1</b> and INT<b>2</b>) to allow a processor to control when serial data is provided from the SDA so that the processor does not have to continuously monitor the accelerometer for output. The INT<b>1</b> and INT<b>2</b> are user programmable to configured interrupt control for the processor.</p>
<p id="p-0160" num="0158">In an implementation, the accelerometer outputs digital data to indicate the orientation of the axes with respect to the direction of the acceleration of gravity vector. For example, if an axis (e.g., positive y-axis) is in the direction of the of acceleration of gravity vector, the accelerometer can output a first value (e.g., +1000) to indicate this direction of the axis. For example, if the axis (e.g., positive y-axis) is in the opposite direction of the of acceleration of gravity vector, the accelerometer can output a second value (e.g., &#x2212;1000) to indicate this direction of the axis where the first value might be a positive value and the second value might be a negative value. Those of skill in the art will realize other values that can be output by the accelerometer to indicate alignment and antialignment with the acceleration of gravity vector. Values for the orientation of the x-axis and z-axis can similarly be output by the accelerometer. In an implementation for vertical rotation <b>1839</b> of the system unit as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>11</b></figref>, output from the accelerometer for only one axis (e.g., y-axis) is monitored and used by the processor to determine whether the system unit is being vertically rotated with respect to the acceleration of gravity vector. The processor can be configured to monitor the value output for the accelerometer for a given axis (e.g., +1000 for the y-axis) to determine whether the system unit is being rotated. The processor can compare the value output (e.g., &#x2212;1000 for the y-axis for a 180 degree rotation from vertical, sensor head down and top up) by the accelerometer to the maximum value output (e.g., +1000 for the y-axis) to determine the real-time angular orientation of the accelerometer. A history of the output of the accelerometer might not be stored used to detect past angular orientation of the system unit.</p>
<p id="p-0161" num="0159">An average can be reset when the average number is reset (e.g., reset in memory, reset on the display, or both). New oximetry measurement information for one or more tissue locations can be stored in the memory for a new average. In an implementation, the memory storing the average information can be reset.</p>
<p id="p-0162" num="0160">For the reset to occur the system unit can be rotated through a first angle downward (e.g., the display is rotated down and the probe face is rotated up). Thereafter, the system unit can be rotated through a second angle upward (e.g., the display is rotated up and the probe face is rotated down). The first and second angles can be different angles to that the reset occurs according to a hysteresis process. That it, a reset can occur after the downward rotation, but a second reset will not occur after the subsequent upward rotation.</p>
<p id="p-0163" num="0161"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>21</b></figref> is a graph showing the first rotation angle and the second rotation angle that the system unit may be vertically rotated by to affect the average reset. The first angle is represented by the solid line in the graph and identified in the graph's legend as &#x201c;Device being inverted,&#x201d; (e.g., the display is rotated down and the probe face is rotated up). The system unit being inverted is sometimes referred to as the system unit being &#x201c;dipped.&#x201d; The first angle may be from about 130 degrees to about 150 degrees. In an embodiment, the first angle is 135 degrees. The second angle is represented by the dashed line in the graph and identified in the graph's legend as &#x201c;Device being un-inverting,&#x201d; (e.g., the display is rotated up and the probe face is rotated down). The accelerometer of the system unit may be configured to detect vertical rotations. The accelerometer may not be configured to determine whether the device is oriented upright (e.g., display of the system unit oriented up and the probe face oriented down) or oriented down (e.g., display of the system unit oriented down and the probe face oriented up). By configuring the system to detect the system unit being rotated down at the first angle and being rotated up at the second angle, the system unit can use motion detection detected by the accelerometer and the hysteresis to determine whether the system unit is being rotated up or rotated down.</p>
<p id="p-0164" num="0162"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>17</b></figref> is a flow diagram of a method of operation of the system unit for generating average oximetry information, in an implementation. The flow diagram shows an example embodiment in an implementation. Steps may be added, removed, or combined without deviating from the method.</p>
<p id="p-0165" num="0163">At <b>2400</b>, at an initial state of the method, no oximetry measurements (i.e., &#x201c;average count&#x201d;) have been made for tissue to be measured of a single patient. For each tissue location that oximetry measurements are made, the average count may be incremented by one if a set of lift and place rules of the system unit are satisfied or may remain unchanged if the set lift and place rules are not satisfied. For example, if the set of rules is satisfied for a first tissue location, then the average count is one. If the set of rules is satisfied for a second tissue location, then the average count is incremented by one and is two. If the set of rules is satisfied for a third tissue location, then the average count is incremented by one and is three. If the set of rules is satisfied for a fourth tissue location, then the average count is incremented by one and is four. If the set of rules is satisfied for a fifth tissue location, then the average count is incremented by one and is five. If the set of rules is satisfied for a sixth tissue location, then the average count is incremented by one and is six. This process of incrementing the average count continues to increment by one for each subsequent tissue location that the system unit is placed at if the set of rules is satisfied.</p>
<p id="p-0166" num="0164">If the lift and place rules are not satisfied, for example, for the third tissue location, then the average count is not incremented by one, and the average count may remain at two. The lift and placement rules used by the system unit to increment the average count or not increment the average count are described with respect to the following steps of the method.</p>
<p id="p-0167" num="0165">In an embodiment, the values for the average count are stored in a memory (e.g., a buffer memory) of the system. The stored value for the average count is incremented when the lift and place set of rules are satisfied for tissue oximetry measurements for the tissue locations of the patient tissue of the select patient.</p>
<p id="p-0168" num="0166">At <b>2405</b>, the system unit interrogates the memory (e.g., the buffer memory) of the system unit to determine whether the average count is greater than zero or equal to zero. If the average count is greater than zero, then an oximetry measurement has been made for at least one tissue location of the patient tissue and the lift and place rules have been satisfied for the measurements made by the system unit. If the average count is zero, then no oximetry measurements have been made.</p>
<p id="p-0169" num="0167">At <b>2405</b>, if the average count is greater than zero (e.g., interrogate the memory that stores the average count), then at <b>2410</b> the display of the system unit displays the current average count and average information for the oximetry measurements (e.g., average oxygen saturation measurements) for the tissue locations. More specifically, the system unit may display &#x201c;Avg N, M %&#x201d; (see <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>15</b></figref>) on the display, where N is the current average count and M is the average of the oximetry measurements, which are calculated as the sum of the oximetry measurements divided by the average count.</p>
<p id="p-0170" num="0168">At <b>2405</b>, if the average count is zero, then at <b>2415</b>, the system unit displays the current average count and no average information for the oximetry measurements. For example, the system unit may display &#x201c;Avg 0, --%&#x201d; (see <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>14</b></figref>) on the display, where N is the average count and the dashes indicate that no average information for the oximetry information is displayed. The display may display the two dashes or other text or another icon to indicate that no average for the oximetry measurement is displayed.</p>
<p id="p-0171" num="0169">At <b>2420</b>, the system unit makes one or more oximetry measurements for a tissue location. If the system unit is executing the method for a first time, the tissue location is a first tissue location. If the system unit executes the method for a second time, the tissue location may be a second tissue location. If the system unit executes the method for a third time, the tissue location may be a third tissue location. The tissue locations increase as the method continues to be executed (loop through the loop portions of the method). The system unit determines whether the sheath or system unit (e.g., system unit used without the sheath) contacts the tissue and whether the oximetry information (e.g., oxygen saturation information) for the oximetry measurement is valid oximetry information. The system unit will display the oximetry information if the oximetry information is valid oximetry information.</p>
<p id="p-0172" num="0170">At <b>2420</b>, if the sheath or system unit is not in contact with the tissue, if the oximetry information is not valid, or both, then the method return to step <b>2405</b> and repeats the described steps until the method is terminated, such as by inversion of the system unit described above with respect to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>21</b> and <b>22</b>A-<b>22</b>B</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0173" num="0171">At <b>2420</b>, if the sheath or system unit is in contact with the tissue, if the oximetry information is valid, or both, then at <b>2425</b>, the system unit determines whether this state (e.g., if the sheath or system unit is in contact with the tissue, if the oximetry information is valid, or both) has persisted for at least three display update cycles. The display may update the oximetry information that is displayed on the display after one update cycle that has a threshold cycle time. The threshold cycle time may be from about 1 second to about 3 seconds. In an implementation, the threshold cycle time is about 2 seconds. Thus, three update cycle times may be from about 3 seconds to about 9 seconds. In the specific embodiment, three update cycles may be about 6 seconds.</p>
<p id="p-0174" num="0172">At <b>2425</b>, if the state (e.g., if the sheath or system unit is in contact with the tissue, if the oximetry information is valid, or both) has not persisted for at least three display update cycles, then the system unit continues to make oximetry measurements for the tissue location at <b>2420</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0175" num="0173">At <b>2425</b>, if the state (e.g., if the sheath or system unit is in contact with the tissue, if the oximetry information is valid, or both) has persisted for at least three display update cycles, then the system unit displays a use message (e.g., a &#x201c;lift up&#x201d; message) on the display at <b>2430</b>. The use message informs the user that the user has to take a specific action with the system unit so that the system unit can accumulate an average of oximetry measurements.</p>
<p id="p-0176" num="0174">At <b>2435</b>, the system unit determines whether the sheath or system unit has been lifted, such as if the system unit has been lifted out of contact with the tissue.</p>
<p id="p-0177" num="0175">In an implementation, the lift is detected by determining that measured oximetry information is no longer valid for the patient tissue. Invalid oximetry information may be outside of a range of predetermined valid oximetry information. Invalid oximetry information may include an oxygen saturation measurement that provides an invalid result, for example, from an extreme property prediction, a poor fit of measured values to a lookup database of stored Monte Carlo simulated reflectance curves, ambient light saturation (e.g., when the system unit is lifted from tissue, or other factors.</p>
<p id="p-0178" num="0176">When the system unit detects that a lift has occurred, the system unit determines whether the lift occurred when the lift up message was displayed on the display. The system unit may store oximetry information in a memory location in which the average oximetry information is stored. The system unit may also store information (e.g., the average count) for the number of times oximetry information is stored for the average oximetry information.</p>
<p id="p-0179" num="0177">At <b>2435</b>, if the system unit has not been removed from the tissue, has been removed from the tissue when the use message is not displayed, or both, then the lift message is displayed at <b>2430</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0180" num="0178">At <b>2445</b>, if the system unit has been removed from the tissue, has been removed from the tissue when the use message is displayed, or both, then at <b>2440</b>, the average count is incremented by one.

<p id="p-0183" num="0180"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>18</b></figref> is a flow diagram of a method of operation of the system unit for generating average oximetry information, in an implementation. The flow diagram shows an example embodiment in an implementation. Steps may be added, removed, or combined without deviating from the method.</p>
<p id="p-0184" num="0181">At <b>2500</b>, the second sheath window of the sheath or the probe face of the probe tip of the system unit (e.g., if used without the sheath) is initially placed into contact with patient tissue by a user at a first tissue location.</p>
<p id="p-0185" num="0182">At <b>2505</b>, the system unit makes a first oximetry measurement of the patient tissue and generates first oximetry information. The system unit may store the determined oximetry information in one of the memories of the system unit, such as the system unit RAM <b>312</b>. This first oximetry information may be stored in a memory location in which the average oximetry information is stored.</p>
<p id="p-0186" num="0183">At <b>2510</b>, the display of the system unit displays the first oximetry information (e.g., oxygen saturation) that is determined by the system unit.</p>
<p id="p-0187" num="0184">At <b>2515</b>, after the first oximetry measurement is performed for a threshold period of time, the use message (e.g., &#x201c;lift up&#x201d; message) is displayed on the display. The threshold period of time may be about 1 to about 10 seconds. In an implementation, the threshold period of time is 5 seconds.</p>
<p id="p-0188" num="0185">At <b>2520</b>, the system unit detects that the user has initially lifted the sheath, system unit, or both from the tissue. In an implementation, the lift is detected by determining that measured oximetry information is no longer valid for the patient tissue. Invalid oximetry information may be outside of a range of predetermined valid oximetry information. Invalid oximetry information may include an oxygen saturation measurement that provides an invalid result, for example, from an extreme property prediction, a poor fit of measured values to a lookup database of stored Monte Carlo simulated reflectance curves, ambient light saturation (e.g., when the system unit is lifted from tissue, or other factors.</p>
<p id="p-0189" num="0186">When the system unit detects that a lift has occurred, the system unit then determines whether the lift occurred when the lift message was displayed. The system unit may then store the first oximetry information in a memory location in which the average oximetry information is stored. The system unit may also store information (e.g., the average count number) for a number of times oximetry information is stored for the average oximetry information. At the current step of the method, the number of stored pieces of oximetry information is one.</p>
<p id="p-0190" num="0187">At <b>2525</b>, the number of times that the oximetry information is stored for the average oximetry reading is displayed on the display. Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>14</b></figref>, the number of times that the oximetry information is stored for the average oximetry reading is 1. When the number of times that the oximetry information is stored is displayed on the display, the average oximetry information may also be displayed. If the number of times that the oximetry information is stored is 1, then the oximetry information is not an average, but is the first oximetry information. In an embodiment, the average oximetry information is not displayed (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>14</b></figref>) on the display until a threshold number (e.g., three, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>15</b></figref>) of pieces of oximetry information are averaged and stored in the memory. The information displayed may be two dashes or a different icon.</p>
<p id="p-0191" num="0188">At <b>2530</b>, the system unit detects that the second window of the sheath or the probe face of the probe tip of the system unit is placed back into contact with the patient tissue. The location on the patient tissue may be the first tissue location associated with step <b>2500</b> or may be a different tissue location (i.e., a second tissue location). The system unit may then detect contact with the patient tissue by generating valid oximetry information that is in the range of predetermined valid oximetry information.</p>
<p id="p-0192" num="0189">At <b>2535</b>, the system unit makes another oximetry measurement (e.g., a second oximetry measurement) of the patient tissue and generates additional oximetry information (e.g., second oximetry information) for the threshold period of time. The system unit may store the additional oximetry information in the system unit memory. The display of the system unit may display the oximetry information (e.g., oxygen saturation) that is determined by the system unit. In an implementation, the system unit does not display the oximetry information.</p>
<p id="p-0193" num="0190">At <b>2540</b>, after the oximetry measurement of step <b>2535</b> is performed for the threshold period of time, the use message (e.g., &#x201c;lift up&#x201d; message) is displayed on the display.</p>
<p id="p-0194" num="0191">At <b>2545</b>, the system unit detects that the user has lifted the sheath, system unit, or both from the tissue.</p>
<p id="p-0195" num="0192">At <b>2550</b>, if the system unit determines that the use message (e.g., &#x201c;lift up&#x201d;) was displayed on the display when the sheath, system unit, or both are lifted from the tissue, the additional oximetry information (e.g., the second oximetry information) is added to the prior generated oximetry information (e.g., the first oximetry information) and is stored in the memory. The system unit may generate the average of the summed oximetry information. At the current step of the method, the first and second oximetry information are averaged and stored in the memory.</p>
<p id="p-0196" num="0193">The system unit may also increment the stored information for the number of times oximetry information is stored for the average oximetry information. At the current step of the method, the number of stored pieces of oximetry information is two. If the sheath, system unit, or both are lifted from the tissue and placed onto the tissue for the threshold number of times (e.g., 3 times), then the system unit displays the average generated at <b>2555</b> on the display.</p>
<p id="p-0197" num="0194">At <b>2550</b>, if the system unit determines that the use message (e.g., &#x201c;lift up&#x201d;) was not displayed on the display when the sheath, system unit, or both are lifted from the tissue, the addition oximetry information (e.g., the second oximetry information) is not averaged with the prior stored average oximetry information (e.g., the first oximetry information). That is, step <b>2555</b> is skipped. Additionally, the system unit displays the current average for the oximetry information on the display (<b>2565</b>).</p>
<p id="p-0198" num="0195">At <b>2565</b>, the method repeats method steps <b>2530</b> to <b>2565</b> until the user stops the method from executing, such as by inverting the system unit to reset the average oximetry information.

<p id="p-0240" num="0237">In an implementation, the system unit makes oximetry readings when the system unit or the sheath, which the system unit is located in, makes good contact with tissue for at least three displayed readings (for example, about six seconds). In an implementation, an oximetry reading is the instantaneous oxygen saturation StO2 that is calculated by the system unit at any given time, based on the system unit sequencing through the lighting of the system unit's various LEDs (light emitting diodes), and measuring, by the unit's one or more detectors, intensities of the light after being transmitted through the illuminated tissue. An oximetry reading can further include the system unit performing various operations on the collected and measured light, such as performing one or more of digitization, various comparisons, calibration adjustments, calculations, memory storage operations, other operations, or any combination of these operations.</p>
<p id="p-0241" num="0238">As described briefly above, oximetry readings are taken by the system unit's processor at a variable rate, between 0.5 hertz and 3.2 hertz, where the variability of the rate is dependent on the requirements of a thermal control measurement system and various thermal algorithms operated by the system unit. In other implementations, the rate can be above 3.2 hertz, such as from about 4 hertz to about 1 kilohertz. The system unit's ADC can sample measurement information generated by the system unit's photodetectors at a higher rate, such as about 200-300 kilohertz. In an implementation, a most recent oximetry reading value is displayed on the display. In an implementation, subsequent to an oximetry reading value being displayed on the display, the oximetry reading value is stored in one of the system unit's memory devices, such as the system unit's flash memory. Storage and use of oximetry reading values by the system unit are described further below.</p>
<p id="p-0242" num="0239">Oximetry reading values are the labeled &#x201c;real-time StO2&#x201d; values that are displayed on the lower right portion of the display, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>23</b></figref>. The location where the oximetry reading values are displayed on the display is sometimes referred to as the &#x201c;live&#x201d; field because every two seconds, for example, the system unit controls the display to display whatever the most recent oximetry reading value that the system unit has generated. Thus, a user of the system unit is able to view and ascertain the most recent tissue property of a patient.</p>
<p id="p-0243" num="0240">In an implementation, the sheath with the system unit located inside the sheath can make one or more oximetry readings of tissue. In another implementation, the system unit is used without the sheath and can make one or more oximetry readings.</p>
<p id="p-0244" num="0241">The following description describes the use of the system unit located in the sheath. The following description applies equally to the use of the system unit without the sheath. The system unit makes a &#x201c;measurement&#x201d; during a time period when a sensor window of the sheath is placed into contact with tissue by a user and is removed from contact with the tissue. The system unit can make a number of readings (e.g., five readings) when the sensor window of the sheath is placed into contact with tissue and then removed from contact with the tissue for the number of times (e.g., five series of contact and subsequent lift from contact events). When a current oximetry reading value is displayed on the display and the value is stored in memory, a time value for a time that oximetry reading is display on the display is stored in a memory of the system unit. When the oximetry reading value is displayed on the display for a time that is greater than a threshold time (e.g., about 1.5 seconds to about 3 seconds, such as about 2 seconds), a new oximetry reading value is displayed on the display. Prior to the new oximetry reading being displayed on the display for the threshold time, each most recent oximetry reading value is stored in memory. In a specific implementation, only the most recent oximetry reading value that is displayed on the display is stored in memory.</p>
<p id="p-0245" num="0242">When the system unit is located in the sheath, the probe tip that includes one or more light source structures (i.e., source structures) and one or more light detector structures (i.e., detector structures) is in contact with a sensor window of the sheath. Through the sensor window, the system unit can emit light into tissue from the source structures and detect the light subsequent to the light traveling through the tissue. Light can include visible light (e.g., red light), infrared (e.g., near-infrared light), or both visible light and infrared (IR).</p>
<p id="p-0246" num="0243">In an implementation, the system unit averages a number of oximetry reading values from a corresponding number of measurements. As described briefly above, the system unit stores an oximetry reading value from a measurement in the unit's memory, such as the unit's flash memory. Each stored oximetry reading value is the n&#x2212;1 oximetry reading value of n oximetry reading values generated by the system unit. When a new oximetry reading value (n value) is displayed on the display, the subsequently displayed oximetry reading value (n&#x2212;1) is stored in the memory. Each oximetry reading value that is stored in the memory is overwritten by a new n&#x2212;1 oximetry reading value. Storing and overwriting is a continuous process for each measurement (e.g., a placement on tissue and a subsequent lift from the tissue after the placement) that the system unit makes.</p>
<p id="p-0247" num="0244">When a user removes the sheath from contact with tissue and a measurement is concluded, the system unit uses the oximetry reading value stored in memory for generating an average of oximetry reading values. Each nth oximetry reading value for a measurement is not stored in the memory and is not used for generating an average of oximetry reading values because there is a possibility that the sheath was in poor contact or out of contact with the tissue when the nth oximetry reading value was generated. Thus, each nth oximetry reading value may not be an accurate value of the oxygen saturation of the tissue. Thus, the n&#x2212;1 (second to last) oximetry reading values of measurement are used by the system unit to generate an average. The system unit briefly displays the text &#x201c;Saved NN %&#x201d; <b>3130</b> in the center field of the display, indicating that a particular oximetry reading value has been saved to the memory and thus indicating that the value will be used by the system unit to generate the average. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>24</b></figref> shows the display with the &#x201c;Saved NN %&#x201d; message in the center field of the display. In the particular example implementation shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>24</b></figref>, the saved value is Saved 62%.</p>
<p id="p-0248" num="0245">The system unit increments and stores a value for the number of measurements that the system unit has taken. The number is used by the system unit to generate the average for the oximetry reading values for the measurements. In the particular example implementation shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>24</b></figref>, the number of measurements is 3.</p>
<p id="p-0249" num="0246">In an implementation, the system unit generates a sum for the n&#x2212;1 oximetry reading values that are stored in memory when a measurement is concluded (i.e., when the sheath is removed from contact with patient tissue). This sum is stored in the memory. The average of the oximetry reading values is the sum divided by the number of measurements. The sum is sometimes referred to as a running sum and the average is sometimes referred to as a running average.</p>
<p id="p-0250" num="0247">In an implementation, an average oximetry value is displayed on the display of the system unit. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>23</b></figref>, the average oximetry value is displayed on the upper right side of the display. The average oximetry value may be displayed at other locations of the display. The number of oximetry reading values included in an average oximetry value is also displayed on the display, in an embodiment. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>23</b></figref>, the number is displayed on the upper left side of the display. In an implementation, an oximetry reading value, an average oximetry value, and the number of measurements in an average are displayed on the display when no warnings are displayed on the display, no system unit error has occurred, or both.</p>
<p id="p-0251" num="0248"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>25</b></figref> shows the display with a &#x201c;Lift Up&#x201d; message <b>3140</b> displayed. In an implementation, after a number of oximetry reading values have been made and displayed on the display, typically after about 4 seconds to about 8 seconds (e.g., after about 6 seconds), the lift up message is displayed on the display. The displayed lift up message indicates that a measurement can be completed and a user can lift the sheath from contact with the tissue. The lift up message also indicates to a user that a current oximetry reading value will be stored in the memory so that the generation of an average oximetry value can occur. The lift up message may be located below the value for the number of measurements in an average, below the average oximetry value identified by the label number of measurements in average, and above the real-time StO2 value.</p>

<p id="p-0276" num="0272">The display can display additional information, such as a quality metric indicator. The quality metric indicator is labeled &#x201c;Measurement Quality Indicator&#x201d; in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>22</b>A</figref>. In the implementation shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>22</b>A</figref>, the quality metric indicator can highlight 5 bars. The bars can be highlighted or not highlighted to include the quality of contact of the sheath with the tissue. The display can also display a battery charge indicator. The battery charge indicator can be displayed on the display below the center field as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>24</b>-<b>25</b></figref> or can be displayed in other locations on the display.</p>
<p id="p-0277" num="0273"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>27</b></figref> is a flow diagram for a flow of information and a processing flow performed by the system unit. The steps of the diagram can be implemented in circuits in the system unit, software modules that include software than can be executed by various circuits of the system unit, user operation of the system unit, or any combination of circuits, software, and user operation.</p>
<p id="p-0278" num="0274">In an implementation, at <b>3600</b> a sensor window of the sheath with the system unit located in the sheath is placed into contact with tissue to be measured. The source structures of the system unit can direct light (e.g., visible, near infrared, or both) into the tissue through the sensor window. After the light is transmitted through the tissue, the detectors structures of the system unit can detect the tissue. At <b>3605</b>, the system unit digitizes light information generated by the detectors in response to the detected light. The digitized values can be adjusted using one or more calibration coefficients stored in the memory of the system unit. At <b>3610</b>, the system unit generates oximetry reading values from the digitized information. The other intermediate values in a calculation can also be generated, such as absorption coefficient, reduced absorption coefficients, or other values. At <b>3615</b>, the system unit performs error checking, an oximetry reading value update rate, other logic, one of these processes, or any combination of these processes. At <b>3620</b>, the system unit generates values for the live oximetry reading values. At <b>3635</b>, the system unit generates the values for the measurement averages. The oximetry reading values, the measurement averages, and the number of measurements in an average are provided to the display for display at <b>3635</b>. At <b>3630</b>, the system unit generates information from physical input from various modules of the system unit, such as the accelerometer. The accelerometer can provide information for inversion of the system unit for resetting information for the oximetry readings, the measurement averages, and the number of measurements in an average. The physical input information is provided to the display at <b>3635</b> for control of the display to display reset information or other physical information. The steps of the method are described further below with respect to circuit elements of the system unit that may perform the described functions.</p>

<p id="p-0281" num="0276">In an implementation, the display is a pixilated display, having pixels arranged in rows and columns. The display can be an OLED (organic LED) display or a PLED (polymer OLED) display. In another implementation, the display is an LCD (liquid crystal display including for example, passive matrix LCD, active matrix LCD, IPS LCD, TN LCD, AFFS LCD, backlit LCD, and others) or an LED (light emitting diode display). The display can have a number of heights and widths. In an implementation, the display area of the display is square and is about 38 millimeters (1.5 inches) high by about 38 millimeters (1.5 inches) wide. The display can have a number of different pixels in each row and each column. In an implementation, the display is a square arranged with the same number of pixels horizontally and vertically, such as 128 pixels by 128 pixels. The display can be a color display or a monochrome (e.g., black and white, blue and white, or other single color and white) display. In a specific implementation, the display is a 4DOLED-282815 display manufactured by 4D System of Minchinbury Australia.</p>
<p id="p-0282" num="0277">Table E below provides information for the locations of information displayed on the display. The location information includes a number of pixels that a piece of information is displayed at relative to the left side of the display and is referred to in table E as the left pixel offset. The location information includes a number of pixels that a piece of information is displayed relative to the top side of the display and is referred to in table E as the top pixel offset. The location information includes a pixel width value and pixel height value that indicate an area in pixels in which particular information is displayed. Table E is one particular implementation for information display on the display. Other implementations include the information displayed on the display located at alternative locations. It will be understood by those of skill in the art that displaying the displayed information a relatively small number (e.g., up to 1 to 10 pixels) of pixels from those pixels in table E are not a variation from the particular embodiment shown in this table.</p>

<p id="p-0284" num="0278"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>29</b></figref> shows a display system of an oximeter or other medical device that provides real-time and average values on a display. The oximeter or other medical device can be a self-contained or standalone unit that is battery-operated and wireless or cordless (e.g., no power cord).</p>
<p id="p-0285" num="0279">More specifically, a circuit <b>400</b> controls the display of information that is displayed on the display. The circuit includes a real-time input circuit <b>405</b>, an averaging circuit <b>410</b>, a physical input circuit <b>420</b>, and a display controller circuit <b>425</b>. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>29</b></figref> also shows display <b>307</b> and a memory <b>415</b> (e.g., a flash memory) connected to circuit <b>400</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0286" num="0280">In an implementation, real-time inputs circuit <b>305</b> is connected to the detectors of the system unit. The real-time inputs circuit can be a digital circuit that can receive digitized information for light that is collected by the detectors. An analog-to-digital converter circuit can be connected between the detectors and the real-time inputs circuit. In an implementation, the real-time inputs circuit can be a mixed signal device that includes an analog-to-digital converter circuit and additional circuits that can perform one or more of a variety of functions on light information received from the detectors. The real-time inputs circuit can include the processor of the system unit. The real-time inputs circuit can include additional circuits such as one or more buffer memories, timing circuits, control circuits, logic circuits, other circuits, or any combination of these circuits.</p>
<p id="p-0287" num="0281">The real-time inputs circuit is coupled to both the averaging circuit <b>410</b> and the display controller <b>425</b>. The real-time input circuit <b>410</b> can buffer oximetry reading values and transmit these values to the averaging circuit <b>410</b> and to the display controller circuit <b>425</b>. The averaging module can receive the information from the real-time inputs circuit to determine a value for a measurement average from the information received from the real-time inputs circuit, one or more other circuits, or a combination of these circuits. For example, in an embodiment where the system unit includes an accelerometer, the averaging module can collect information directly or indirectly from the accelerometer to determine a number of measurements that the system unit has made for use in determining the average. In another embodiment, the averaging circuit module may be adapted to determine the beginning and end of a measurement based on the oximetry measurement values received from the real-time inputs circuit, such as determining oximetry reading values associated with the sheath coming out of contact with tissue. The averaging circuit can transmit the value for the measurement average, the value of the number of measurements in an average, one of these values, or both of these values to the display controller circuit.</p>
<p id="p-0288" num="0282">Memory <b>415</b> can store information for a background screen for the display. The background screen information is sometimes referred to as splash screen information. The information for the background screen can include information for display elements displayed on the display that do not change except when the display is taken over for the display of other information, such as warning information regarding the system unit. The background screen information can include information that is generally static on the display when oximetry information is being displayed, when the system unit is ready to take a measurement and display oximetry information, and after the system unit has been inverted and the oximetry information generated by the system unit has been reset.</p>
<p id="p-0289" num="0283">In an implementation, the information for the background screen includes the information for the text &#x201c;avg of,&#x201d; &#x201c;live,&#x201d; and &#x201c;% StO2&#x201d; for both the measurement average and the real-time oximetry measurements. In an implementation, the information for the background screen includes some or all of the portions for the black background of the display as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>23</b>-<b>27</b></figref>. In an implementation, the information for the background screen includes some or all of the portions for the black background of the display as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>23</b>-<b>27</b></figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0290" num="0284">In an implementation, the information for the color inverted portions of the display are included in the information for the background screen. For example, the information for the color inverted portions of the background screen can include the portion (e.g., first white box portion) of the display in which the number of measurements in an average is displayed and the portion (e.g., second white box portion) of the background screen in which the measurement average is displayed.</p>
<p id="p-0291" num="0285">The background screen can include the quality metric status indicator without any elements of the indicator highlighted to indicate the quality status. The quality metric status indicator is a template that is stored as a hex table in the memory. For example, the quality metric status indicator can be stored in a hex table of up to 6 rows of 0x0000 data before the first hex value appears. Any other portion of the background screen can similarly be stored in the form of one or more hex tables in the memory. A read performed on the memory by the physical inputs circuit or another circuit can retrieve information from the tables from the memory so that various portions of the background screen can be displayed on the display.</p>
<p id="p-0292" num="0286">The background information can be transmitted to the display controller circuit by the physical input circuit <b>420</b>. Alternatively, the background information can be transferred to the display controller circuit by other circuits of circuit <b>400</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0293" num="0287">In an implementation, the pixel location information of table E shown above is stored in the memory, such as in a hex table. The pixel information can be retrieved by the physical inputs circuit for transmission to the display controller. In another implementation, the display controller can access the memory to retrieve the background information including the pixel location information.</p>
<p id="p-0294" num="0288">In an implementation, the physical inputs circuit <b>420</b> is coupled to other circuits that are included in the system unit, such as a timing circuit, an accelerometer circuit, an ambient light detector circuit, a microphone circuit, other circuits, or any one of these circuits, or one combination of these circuits. For example, the physical inputs circuit can be connected to the accelerometer circuit to collect information about the movement of the system unit, such as the detected inversion of the system unit. Information for an inversion of the system unit can be transmitted from the physical inputs circuit to the display controller circuit. Other physical information received by the physical inputs circuit can be transmitted from the physical inputs circuit to the display controller.</p>
<p id="p-0295" num="0289">The display controller circuit <b>425</b> can be an ASIC circuit, a configuration circuit, a non-configurable circuit, or another type of circuit that is adapted to format collected information for transfer to the display for display. The display controller circuit can include a scaler circuit, be connected to a scaler circuit, or another circuit so that characters and graphics can be displayed at predetermined sizes on the display.</p>
<p id="p-0296" num="0290">The display controller circuit can receive input values for scale information for scaling. The display controller circuit can be connected to a clock circuit so that information is transmitted from the display controller circuit to the display at a predetermined clock rate. The system unit can include a clock tree that adapts a clock signal from the clock circuit for use by the display controller, the display, and another circuit of the system unit.</p>
<p id="p-0297" num="0291">The display controller circuit can include one or more memories to buffer collected information prior to transmission of the information to the display. The buffer memory can be a RAM or another memory type. Alternatively, the display controller circuit can be connected to an external memory (e.g., a RAM) that the display controller circuit accesses for use as a buffer memory.</p>
<p id="p-0298" num="0292">The display controller circuit <b>425</b> is connected to the display. The display controller circuit can transmit collected information from the real-time inputs circuit, the averaging circuit, the physical inputs circuits, other circuits, or any combination of these circuits to the display controller circuit. The transmitted information can be transmitted in a format the display can receive for use for display on the display. The information can be transmitted through a serial port to the display. Alternatively, the information can be transmitted through a parallel port to the display. In an implementation, the display is configurable to operate a serial port or a parallel port to receive information from the display controller circuit.</p>
<p id="p-0299" num="0293">The information for the background screen can be transferred from the display controller to the display. The background information may not need to be rewritten on the display unless the displayed information is replaced with other information that does not use the background, such as a warning that is displayed on the display. Transferring the background information to the display from the display control reduces the amount of information that has to be refreshed on the display when new information is displayed on the display. For example, information in the fields in which numerical values are displayed, the central field in which text information is displayed, the battery indicator, and the quality information display can be provided from the display controller circuit to the display independently from the information for the background screen and the display can update the displayed information for these fields independently from the background. Updating the information in the described fields allows for the information in these fields to be updated relatively quickly so that a user of the system unit is relatively quickly shown stable or changing oximetry information, which the system unit generates for a patient's tissue. The quick display of accurate oximetry information can aid in facilitating a successful surgery, for example, such as a tissue flap surgery for breast reconstruction, where accurate oximetry information can aid in the success of the surgery.</p>
<p id="p-0300" num="0294">In an implementation, memory locations of memory <b>415</b> are mapped to pixels of display <b>307</b>. Mapping memory locations of memory <b>415</b> to pixels of display <b>307</b> allow for the pixels to be efficiently used to display information in the mapped memory and not update the display of information displayed in other pixels of the display that are not mapped to the memory locations.</p>
<p id="p-0301" num="0295">The memory location can include rows of the memory, columns of the memory, rows and columns of the memory, or other locations. In an implementation, the system unit includes the display, which is arranged in an array of pixels in rows and columns. The system unit <b>301</b> includes display controller circuit <b>425</b>, which is coupled to display <b>307</b>. The display controller circuit <b>425</b> can be a graphics processing unit (GPU) or another circuit type.</p>
<p id="p-0302" num="0296">In an implementation, a first subset of the array of pixels of the display includes a number of first pixels arranged in first rows and first columns, where there are more first rows than first columns. A second subset of the array of pixels of the display includes a second number of second pixels arranged in second rows and second columns, where there are more second columns than second rows. A third subset of the array of pixels of the display includes a second number of third pixels arranged in third rows and third columns, where there are more third rows than third columns. Table E shows an example of the subsets of arrays of pixels where specific oximetry information is displayed on the display.</p>
<p id="p-0303" num="0297">A pixel coordinate of an upper left corner of the first subset of the array of pixels plus the number of first rows includes a first range of rows of pixels. A pixel coordinate of an upper left corner of the second subset includes a row coordinate that is within the first range of rows of pixels. The display memory <b>415</b> is connected to the display controller circuit <b>425</b>, wherein a first number of memory bits of the display memory map to the first subset of the array of pixels, a second number of memory bits map to the second subset of the array of pixels, and a third number of memory bits map to the third subset of the array of pixels. For example, the memory locations of the memory are mapped to locations to the pixels for the real-time StO2 values to the average number of measurements in an average, to the average over multiple measurements, to the quality metric indicator, to the battery indicator, and to the center field where use information (e.g., lift up) is displayed. Table E above shows an example map of the pixels for these values on the display.</p>
<p id="p-0304" num="0298">In an implementation, the display includes an organic light emitting diode display. A row of the display includes n pixels and a column of the display includes n pixels, and n is an integer 16 or greater.</p>
<p id="p-0305" num="0299">A pixel coordinate of an upper left corner of the first subset of the array of pixels plus the number of first columns includes a first range of columns of pixels. And, a pixel coordinate of an upper left corner of the third subset includes a column coordinate that is within the first range of column of pixels. A character font written to the first subset of the array of pixels is an inverse of the character font written to the second subset of the array of pixels. The third subset of the array of pixels displays a real-time value (e.g., a real-time oxygen saturation value) of an output of the system unit. The first subset of the array of pixels is configured to display the average of two or more real-time values (e.g., real-time oxygen saturation values) generated by the system unit. The first subset of the array of pixels displays the number of real-time values used to generate the average of the real-time values.</p>
<p id="p-0306" num="0300">In an implementation, the display memory includes a fourth number of memory bits that maps to the pixels of the display. A coordinate of the upper left corner of the first subset of the array of pixels is also within the fourth number of the memory bits. And, a coordinate of upper left corner of the second subset of the array of pixels is also within the fourth number of the memory bits.</p>
<p id="p-0307" num="0301"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>30</b></figref> shows a diagram of a laparoscopic oximeter <b>5</b>, in an implementation. The laparoscopic oximeter is a handheld device and is configured for use in laparoscopic surgeries for generating oximetry information, such as an oxygen saturation value, of tissue within the abdominal cavity of a patient.</p>
<p id="p-0308" num="0302">Laparoscopic oximeter <b>5</b> includes a probe unit <b>10</b>, a laparoscopic tube <b>15</b>, and a number of connectors <b>20</b> that detachably connect the probe unit to the elongated tube. Connectors <b>20</b> can include one or more mechanical connectors, one or more optical connectors, one or more electrical connectors, or any of these types of connectors in any combination.</p>
<p id="p-0309" num="0303">The laparoscopic tube <b>15</b> includes an elongated tube <b>315</b> that can be adapted to be inserted into an abdominal cavity of a patient via a trocar for interoperative surgery. The elongated tube <b>315</b> includes a sensor head <b>25</b> that is adapted to emit light (e.g., visible light, near infrared light, or both) into internal tissue and collected reflected light from the tissue based on the emitted light for making oximetry measurements of the internal tissue during the interoperative surgery. Laparoscopic oximeter <b>5</b> can be a tissue oximeter adapted to make tissue oximetry measurements or a pulse oximeter adapted to make pulse oximetry measurements.</p>
<p id="p-0310" num="0304">An outside surface of the laparoscopic tube can be smooth so that the laparoscopic tube can slide through the trocar smoothly, can rotate within the trocar smoothly, and can slide into contact and past patient tissue smoothly and without abrading the tissue. The laparoscopic oximeter can be used on various internal tissue to determine various oximetry information for the tissue, such as oxygen saturation. Internal tissue under test can include intestinal tissue, such as the large intestine, small intestine, tissue that supports these tissues, such as the mesentery tissue, muscle, the liver, kidneys, stomach, gallbladder, pancreas, arteries, heart, lungs, veins, or other internal tissue.</p>
<p id="p-0311" num="0305">The laparoscopic oximeter is fully self-contained and does not need to be connected to another device to be fully operational, in an implementation. That is, the laparoscopic oximeter does not need to be wire connected or wirelessly connected to another device to operate. In an implementation, the laparoscopic oximeter does connect to other devices, such as one or more other medical devices, a computer system, a display, these devices or systems, or other devices or systems.</p>
<p id="p-0312" num="0306">In an implementation, connectors <b>20</b> facilitate the separation of the probe unit from the laparoscopic tube. For example, the probe unit and laparoscopic tube can be separated after the laparoscopic oximeter has been used for a laparoscopic surgery. The probe unit can be reused after the surgery and the laparoscopic tube can be discarded. The probe unit can be cleaned after the surgery and connected to a different laparoscopic tube to form another laparoscopic oximeter. The probe unit can thereafter be used in a different surgery. The probe unit is sometimes referred to as a durable unit because this unit is reusable, whereas the laparoscopic tube is sometimes referred to as a disposable unit because it is to be disposed of after use on a patient.</p>
<p id="p-0313" num="0307">In an implementation, the laparoscopic oximeter (e.g., probe unit <b>10</b>) includes the circuits shown in any one or a combination of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>4</b>-<b>7</b></figref>. The circuits of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>4</b>-<b>7</b></figref> are relatively costly. Allowing for the probe unit to be reused allows for cost savings by the reuse. Allowing for the probe unit to be reused also allows for ecological advantages because the probe unit can be reused a number of times before the probe unit is disposed of.</p>
<p id="p-0314" num="0308">In an implementation, the laparoscopic oximeter is configured to make average oximetry measurements as described above and display the average oximetry information on a display <b>205</b> of the laparoscopic oximeter as described with respect to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>12</b>-<b>21</b></figref>, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>24</b>-<b>30</b></figref>, and tables A-E. In a further implementation, the laparoscopic oximeter is configured to reset or erase one or more pieces of oximetry information, average oximetry information, and reset the display of the laparoscopic oximeter as described above. For example, the laparoscopic oximeter can reset or erase the number of measurements in average <b>3110</b>, the average over multiple measurements <b>3105</b>, the real-time StO2 <b>3100</b>, and reset the display of these values on the display of the laparoscopic oximeter. For example, information used for generating average oximetry information or an average oximetry value is erased from memory of the laparoscopic oximeter, such as memory <b>312</b>, <b>315</b>, one of these memories, or both of these memories and is removed from the display. In an implementation, these values used for generating an average oximetry measurement value and the measurement value can be erased from the accelerometer <b>332</b> detecting one or more of a variety of movements that the laparoscopic oximeter experiences. A method for resetting information used for generating average oximetry information, erasing information used for generating average oximetry information, or both is described further below. It will be understood that in one implementation, erasing values from the memory includes allowing the values to be overwritten with subsequently generated values.</p>

The patient is shown lying on their side in the figures. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>31</b></figref> shows the laparoscopic oximeter at a first time. The laparoscopic oximeter at the first time is oriented in a first rotational direction (e.g., display <b>205</b> facing upward) indicated by axis <b>4010</b>, which is pointing out of the plane of the page. The upward direction out of the plane of the page is indicated by a circle with a dot inside of the circle (e.g., diagram of an arrow pointing out of the page). <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>32</b></figref> shows the laparoscopic oximeter at a second time. The laparoscopic oximeter at the second time is oriented in a second rotational direction (e.g., display <b>205</b> pointing downward and not shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>32</b></figref>, battery compartment <b>207</b> facing up, and finger rest <b>291</b><i>a </i>facing up) indicated by axis <b>4020</b> pointing into the plane of the page. The downward direction into the plane of the page is indicated by a circle with a cross inside of the circle (e.g., diagram of an arrow pointing into the page). The first time can be before the second time. The central axis <b>4000</b> of the laparoscopic oximeter can be approximately perpendicular to the direction of the acceleration of gravity vector (e.g., parallel to the floor of the operating room in which the patient is located).</p>
<p id="p-0316" num="0310">The laparoscopic oximeter can be rotated (indicated by arrow <b>4030</b>) about central axis <b>4000</b> by a user while a portion of laparoscopic element <b>315</b> is located in the trocar and in the patient's abdomen. For example, the laparoscopic oximeter can be rotated from the display up orientation of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>31</b></figref> to the display down orientation of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>32</b></figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0317" num="0311">Rotation of the laparoscopic oximeter about axis <b>4000</b> through a predetermined number of degrees initiates the laparoscopic oximeter to perform the reset and erasure of values described above for generating an average oximetry value and resetting the display as described above. The number of degrees of rotation about axis <b>4000</b> can be about 90-160 degrees to affect the resets, erasures, or both.</p>
<p id="p-0318" num="0312">In an implementation, accelerometer <b>332</b> detects the rotation of the laparoscopic oximeter about central axis <b>4000</b>. Accelerometer <b>332</b> can be a two axes accelerometer, a three axes accelerometer, or two two-axes accelerometers. The accelerometer can be mounted in the laparoscopic oximeter (e.g., on a PCB) so that the accelerometer can detect rotation about central axis <b>4000</b>. In various implementations, the accelerometer can detect rotation about one, two, or three axes of rotation or any combination of these axes of rotation. In an implementation, the accelerometer can detect the rotation of the laparoscopic oximeter with respect to the vector for the acceleration of gravity. The accelerometer can detect a change in the rotational direction about axis <b>4000</b> with respect to the acceleration of gravity vector. In an implementation, the average information is reset by an impulse motion applied to the laparoscopic oximeter. The impulse motion can be applied, for example, when the laparoscopic oximeter is outside of the abdominal cavity of a patient.</p>
<p id="p-0319" num="0313">The accelerometer, the processor, or both can implement hysteresis so that the laparoscopic oximeter does not reset the averaging information and measurements when not intended. The laparoscopic oximeter can implement the hysteresis described above with respect to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>21</b></figref>, where the rotations are horizontal about axis <b>4000</b> rather than vertical as described with respect to system unit <b>305</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0320" num="0314">For example, the laparoscopic oximeter can be rotated about axis <b>4000</b> by about 90 degrees to about 160 degrees (e.g., solid line in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>21</b></figref>) from the orientation of the laparoscopic oximeter shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>31</b></figref> to the orientation of the oximeter shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>32</b></figref> for the averaging information to reset including the information displayed on the display. In an embodiment, the rotation about axis <b>4000</b> is 135 degrees for the averaging information to reset. The laparoscopic oximeter can thereafter be returned from the rotated orientation (e.g., <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>32</b></figref> orientation) to the unrotated orientation (e.g., <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>31</b></figref> orientation). The laparoscopic oximeter will not be able to perform another reset of the averaging information until the rotational orientation of the laparoscopic oximeter is returned to about 45 degrees or less (e.g., the dashed line shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>21</b></figref>) from the unrotated orientation shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>31</b></figref> from the rotated orientation shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>32</b></figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0321" num="0315">Additionally, the accelerometer of the laparoscopic oximeter may not be configured to determine whether the oximeter is oriented in the first orientation of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>31</b></figref> with the display upward or oriented down in the second orientation of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>32</b></figref>. That is, by configuring the laparoscopic oximeter detect the laparoscopic oximeter being rotated about axis <b>4000</b> by the first angle (e.g., solid line of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>21</b></figref>) and being unrotated at the second angle (e.g., dashed line of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>21</b></figref>), the laparoscopic oximeter unit can use motion detection detected by the accelerometer and the hysteresis to determine whether the laparoscopic oximeter is being rotated from the first orientation of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>31</b></figref> (e.g., display up) to the second orientation of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>32</b></figref> (e.g., display down).</p>

The patient <b>4</b> is lying on their back and the acceleration of gravity vector is downward in the plane of the drawing page. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>33</b></figref> shows the laparoscopic oximeter at a first time oriented in a first rotational direction (e.g., display <b>205</b> facing upward) indicated by axis <b>4010</b>. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>34</b></figref> shows the laparoscopic oximeter at a second time oriented in a second rotational direction (e.g., display <b>205</b> pointing downward) indicated by axis <b>4020</b>. The first time can be before the second time. The central axis <b>4000</b> of the laparoscopic oximeter can be angled with respect to the direction of gravity from about 0 degrees (parallel to the direction of gravity) to about 90 degrees (perpendicular to the direction of gravity). The laparoscopic oximeter can be rotated (indicated by arrow <b>4030</b>) about central axis <b>4000</b> by a user while a portion of laparoscopic element <b>315</b> is located in the trocar and in the patient's abdomen for the laparoscopic oximeter to reset the average oximetry information, the real time oximetry information, and the displayed values. For example, the laparoscopic oximeter can be rotated from the display up orientation of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>33</b></figref> to the display down orientation of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>32</b></figref> to reset the average oximetry information, the real time oximetry information, and the displayed values.</p>
<p id="p-0323" num="0317">Rotation of the laparoscopic oximeter about axis <b>4000</b> through a first predetermined number of degrees initiates the laparoscopic oximeter to perform the reset and erasure of values described above for generating an average oximetry value and resetting the display as described above.

The laparoscopic oximeter can be rotated back to its approximate original orientation without performing a second reset due to the described hysteresis according to which the laparoscopic oximeter operates. The angle at which the laparoscopic oximeter is able to perform a second reset is a second predetermined number of degrees that is less than the first predetermined number of degrees. The second predetermined number of degrees may be about 90 degrees or less (e.g., represented by the dashed line in the hysteresis graph shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>21</b></figref>).</p>
