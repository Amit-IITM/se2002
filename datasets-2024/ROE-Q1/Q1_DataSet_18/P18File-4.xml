<heading id="h-0001" level="1">FIELD OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0002" num="0001">The present invention is in the field of materials including wood or other cellulosic fibres and adhesion of such wood products, and more specifically directed to the manufacture of such glued-wood products, and more specifically to providing a biocide-composite applied to the adhesive of the wood-product providing high retention of biocides in such glued-wood products that are hot-pressed or hot-pressed and block-stacked during manufacture.</p>
<heading id="h-0002" level="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">Biocides of various kinds are used to protect commercial wood products with low natural durability from degradation by insects including termites, ants, boring insects, weevils and beetles, as well as decay microorganisms, moulds and sap staining organisms. Historically wood protectants were largely based on inorganic mixtures comprising copper, chromium, arsenic, zinc, tin, boron and fluorine compounds but these are progressively being supplemented and/or replaced with more benign organic biocides in response to environmental and health concerns.</p>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">Biocide treated timber and wood products are sampled and analysed after treatment with biocides to ensure conformity to minimum biocide &#x201c;retentions&#x201d; required to protect the material. These minimum retentions are codified as part of country or regional &#x201c;standards&#x201d; or codes, which are typically based on the material treated, the nature of the threat, e.g. insect or decay, and &#x201c;hazard class&#x201d;, a term referring to the location of the product in a building or structure and the severity of environmental challenge in service, e.g. whether the product is exposed to the weather or protected by cladding in a building. Further standards specify methods of sampling and biocide analysis, treatment methods, etc.</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">Biocide application methods in commercial use range from surface treatments, such as spraying and dipping, to pressure treatments involving full immersion in combination with various cycles of pressure and/or vacuum. Surface or &#x201c;envelope&#x201d; treatments produce limited penetration and are generally suitable for insecticides and anti-sapstain compounds, whereas pressure treatments result in partial or complete penetration depending on the wood species, the type of wood, i.e. sapwood versus heartwood, and the dimensions of the treated article. Pressure treatments are suitable for most types of biocide. Both application methods are widely used to treat sawn timber or lumber.</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">Similar treatment methods are possible with glued-wood products, which include glued-wood products comprising veneers such as plywood and LVL, as well as glued-wood products containing wood strands, particles, etc., such as oriented strand boards (OSB) and medium density fibreboard (MDF).</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">Generally, glued-wood products such as plywood and laminated veneer lumber (LVL), medium density fibreboard (MDF), oriented strand board (OSB), and the like may be surface treated with an insecticide in a minimal volume of water or organic solvent without any loss of structural integrity. Pressure treatments can be used to deliver water-borne or solvent-borne fungicides and/or insecticides to plywood and LVL but aqueous pressure treatments are generally not suitable for MDF, OSB, etc., which can break down when extensively rewetted during treatment. Surface and pressure treatments must be conducted post manufacture with associated logistical complexities and significant cost.</p>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">Another treatment option includes the delivery of wood protectants or biocides in the glues used to make these glued-wood products, also known as &#x201c;glueline treatment&#x201d;. Glueline treatment involves applying the biocide during manufacturing operations. For example, plywood and LVL are manufactured by spreading glue onto dry rotary peeled veneers, assembling a variable number of veneers in the appropriate configuration or &#x201c;layup&#x201d;, optionally cold pressing the layup, and then hot pressing it to compress the product to the required thickness and cure the glue. Glueline treatment of plywood and LVL involves blending the biocide into the glue before spreading thus distributing the biocide in the &#x201c;gluelines&#x201d; and adjacent regions of the wood component in the finished product. Glueline treatments are carried out in a similar fashion with products comprising wood flakes, strands and fibres, except there are more options for introducing the glue and the biocide depending on the particular product and its method of manufacture.</p>
<p id="p-0009" num="0008">The choice of biocide for glueline addition is generally restricted to organic biocides because inorganic compounds are incompatible with most glues, with the exception of some zinc and boron compounds which are compatible with powdered glues used in some fibre and strand based products. However, hot pressing temperatures as high as 250&#xb0; C. can lead to thermal degradation of organic biocides, which results in a reduction of biocide retention across a board compared to the nominal dose applied. Some glues such as isocyanate resins are highly reactive and capable of forming covalent adducts with organic biocides. Other resins may be acidic or alkaline. Heat and pressure, along with the introduction of steam (free water as reactant) in some processes, can exacerbate chemical degradation and/or sequestration of the biocide depending on the glue chemistry.</p>
<p id="p-0010" num="0009">While not wishing to be bound by theory, reduced biocide retentions may result from a complex mixture of processes that may occur during the production including chemical degradation of the biocide, sequestration of the biocide within the cured resin, and conversion of the biocide to other biologically active and inactive chemical forms. The relative importance of these processes is likely to differ from biocide to biocide.</p>
<p id="p-0011" num="0010">Moreover, some glued-wood products are &#x201c;block-stacked&#x201d; post-press to retain heat to allow further glue polymerisation and promote slow cooling to obtain stable flat boards that won't bow or twist post manufacture. The centre of a typical block stack cools from in excess of 100&#xb0; C. to ambient temperature over about two days whereas exterior parts cool more rapidly.</p>
<p id="p-0012" num="0011">Hot press conditions generally lead to relatively uniform reductions in biocide retention across a board compared to the theoretical dose applied. Block stack conditions generally lead to further reductions that are more pronounced at the centre of the stack than the edges. The net result is that the glue must be overdosed with biocide to ensure that all parts of the board pass minimum retention requirements.</p>
<p id="p-0013" num="0012">It has been proposed that some biocidal ingredients are inherently more stable to degradation during hot pressing, including the fungicide epoxiconazole (U.S. Publication No. 2012/0100361), and the insecticides thiacloprid (U.S. Pat. No. 8,114,425) and bifenthrin (AU Patent No. 2003266461).</p>
<p id="p-0014" num="0013">Formulation types in current use for glueline treatment with biocides (including the above) include micro emulsions (ME), emulsion concentrates (EC), suspension concentrates (SC) and wettable powders (WP) as disclosed in AU Patent No. 2003266461 or capsule suspensions (CS) as disclosed in AU Patent No. 2006220419. Further formulation types are described in US publication 2012/0100361 as an oil solution, an emulsion, a solubilizer, a wettable powder, a suspension, a flowable formulation and a dust formulation.</p>
<p id="p-0015" num="0014">Water-insoluble thermoplastics and methods of forming composites with a biocide are included in the following publications, which are incorporated herein by reference:</p>
<p id="p-0016" num="0015">(1) U.S. Publication No. 2012/0071324 discloses acrylonitrile polymers including styrene acrylonitrile polymers, the formation of composites by extrusion and the milling of composites in the presence or absence of non-solvent liquids. The publication proposed incorporation of biocides, in particular algicides, into such polymers for the purpose of reducing leaching into water and hence promoting the longevity of algicides when incorporated into paints.</p>
<p id="p-0017" num="0016">(2) U.S. Publication No. 2006/0111242 discloses powdered formulations comprising an agrochemical, in particular imidacloprid, and a styrene acrylonitrile copolymer containing 20-40% acrylonitrile prepared by extrusion and milling for the purpose of overcoming the phytotoxicity of imidacloprid to seedlings when applied to the seeds as a seed dressing.</p>
<p id="p-0018" num="0017">(3) U.S. Publication No. 2008/0069892 discloses a powdered formulation comprising an agrochemical and a polyurethane and/or polyurethane urea prepared by extrusion and milling or by solvent evaporation and milling for the purpose of applying to plants and/or their environment and achieving release over a prolonged period.</p>
<p id="p-0019" num="0018">(4) U.S. Publication No. 2010/0297204 discloses a particulate polymer matrix prepared by extrusion and milling comprising a biocide and a thermoplastic polymer for the purpose of reducing leaching into water when incorporated into paints and renders. The polymers exemplified include water-insoluble polyurethanes and polyamides.</p>
<p id="p-0020" num="0019">(5) U.S. Pat. No. 7,070,795 discloses matrix particles comprising agricultural active ingredients entrapped within polymeric matrices for the purpose of avoiding phytotoxicity to plants and seeds. A preferred method of matrix particle formation involves dissolution of an active ingredient and a polymer in an organic solvent (organic phase), emulsification into water (aqueous phase), then solvent removal by evaporation (&#x201c;emulsification&#x2014;solvent evaporation&#x201d;). A further preferred method involved hot melt mixing active ingredient and polymer then dispersion into a hot non-miscible solvent (&#x201c;hot melt microencapsulation&#x201d;).</p>
<p id="p-0021" num="0020">None of the above formulation types or biocide presentations provide any solution to the problem of significantly reduced biocide retentions in glued-wood products after hot pressing, in particular after hot pressing and block stacking during manufacture.</p>
<p id="p-0022" num="0021">There is a need to provide compositions and methods for glueline preservation of glued-wood products wherein the biocide is more resistant to degradation, inactivation and/or sequestration during the manufacturing process. Degradation, inactivation and/or sequestration of the biocide during the manufacturing process leads to a decrease of biocide retention in the glued-wood product as well as uneven biocide retentions in different regions of the glued-wood product. This is particularly important after hot pressing and block stacking.</p>
<p id="p-0023" num="0022">A desired feature of the present invention is therefore to overcome the problems as discussed, or at least to provide the public with a useful choice.</p>
<p id="p-0024" num="0023">The present invention provides a solution to this problem by providing biocide-composite materials that achieve high retentions of the biocide in a glueline-treated glued-wood product after hot-pressing and block-stacking. Such high retentions cannot be achieved with the known biocide-formulations. A further advantage is that the biocide is more efficacious.</p>
<p id="p-0025" num="0024">Any discussion of the prior art throughout the specification should in no way be considered as an admission that such prior art is widely known or forms part of the common general knowledge in the field. All references cited in this specification are incorporated by reference in their entirety.</p>

<heading id="h-0005" level="1">DEFINITIONS</heading>
<p id="p-0093" num="0205">As used herein, the terms &#x201c;about,&#x201d; &#x201c;approximately,&#x201d; or &#x201c;generally,&#x201d; when used to modify a value, indicates that the value can be raised or lowered by 10% and remains within the disclosed embodiment.</p>
<p id="p-0094" num="0206">The term &#x201c;retention&#x201d; as used in this disclosure refers to the concentration of biocide active ingredient extracted from the finished glued-wood product and measured by an analytical procedure. Terms such as &#x201c;active ingredient retention&#x201d;, &#x201c;preservative retention&#x201d;, &#x201c;insecticide retention&#x201d; or &#x201c;fungicide retention&#x201d; are often used in the art. Retentions are typically expressed as grams of active ingredient per cubic metre of dried wood product (gai/m<sup>3</sup>) or mass of active ingredient/mass of dried wood product (% m/m). When a glued-wood product is treated with two or more active ingredients, e.g. one or two fungicidal ingredients and an insecticide, the retention of each ingredient is measured. When comparing different biocide formulations, it is also convenient to express biocide retentions as a percentage of the nominal biocide loading or application rate and use the term &#x201c;recovery&#x201d;, i.e. how much of the dose applied was recovered at the completion of manufacture.</p>
<p id="p-0095" num="0207">The term &#x201c;biocide&#x201d; as used herein refers to a compound that renders the material to which it is applied resistant to insect, fungal and microbial attack than the same material without having the compound applied. The term &#x201c;biocide&#x201d;, &#x201c;active ingredient&#x201d; and &#x201c;preservative&#x201d; are used interchangeably.</p>
<p id="p-0096" num="0208">As used herein, the term &#x201c;friable&#x201d; refers to the tendency for the biocide-composite the present invention to disintegrate, break, rupture or crumble during processing, milling or handling.</p>
<p id="p-0097" num="0209">The term &#x201c;glued-wood product&#x201d; as used herein refers to glued-wood products whose production includes at least a glue addition step, a hot pressing step and, optionally, a block stacking step. Glued-wood products include glued veneer products (sometimes called engineered wood products) such as plywood and LVL, products comprising glued-wood flakes, chips, strands, particles, fibres, flour, dusts or nanofibrils (sometimes called reconstituted wood-based products) such as flake boards, chip boards, strand boards, oriented strand boards (OSB), parallel strand lumber, particle board, medium density fibreboard (MDF), high density fibreboard, hard board, etc., and products containing combinations of different layers such as glued strands and glued fibres within the one product. Glued lignocellulosic products based on bamboo, rattan, bagasse, straw, hemp, jute sticks, flax shives and the like are also included within the definition of glued-wood product.</p>
<p id="p-0098" num="0210">The term &#x201c;glue&#x201d; as used herein refers to the non-wood component of the glued-wood product that adheres or bonds the wood components to produce a mechanically stable finished product. The term &#x201c;glue&#x201d; and &#x201c;adhesive&#x201d; are used interchangeably. The term glue includes &#x201c;native resins&#x201d; such as isocyanate resins like polymeric diphenylmethane diisocyanate (pMDI), which can be used as is. Generally, native resins are not single chemicals but rather a plurality of chemicals or different polymeric forms resulting from the syntheses in commercial use. Apart from isocyanates, most native resins can be used in combination with water, wetting agents, fillers, catalysts, etc., and such mixtures are referred to as a &#x201c;glue&#x201d;, &#x201c;glue mixture&#x201d; or a &#x201c;glue mix&#x201d; in the art and throughout this disclosure. Notwithstanding this distinction, the term &#x201c;glue&#x201d; encompasses all forms of adhesive used in the manufacture of hot-pressed or hot-pressed and block-stacked glued-wood products.</p>
<p id="p-0099" num="0211">The term &#x201c;glueline treatment&#x201d; as used herein refers to the delivery of the biocide to a glued-wood product via the glueline, either by direct addition whereby the biocide is added to the glue component before it meets the wood component, or by indirect addition whereby the biocide is added to the wood component before, during or after the wood meets the glue. Glueline treatment is distinct from pressure treatment of wood components before manufacture or pressure treatment of a glued-wood product after manufacture.</p>
<p id="p-0100" num="0212">The term &#x201c;hot pressing&#x201d; as used herein refers to the application of heat and mechanical pressure to compress the assembled constituents of a glued wood products into its final form and to cure or set the glue. The equipment used is called a hot press. The term &#x201c;hot pressed&#x201d; and &#x201c;hot-pressing&#x201d; are used interchangeably.</p>
<p id="p-0101" num="0213">The term &#x201c;block-stacked&#x201d; as used herein refers to a common process applied in the manufacturing of glued-wood products. The glued-wood products are stacked post-press to retain heat to allow further glue polymerisation and promote slow cooling to obtain stable flat boards that won't bow or twist post manufacture. The term &#x201c;block stacked&#x201d; and &#x201c;block-stacking&#x201d; are used interchangeably.</p>
<p id="p-0102" num="0214">The terms &#x201c;hot pressed and block-stacked&#x201d; and &#x201c;simulated block stacking&#x201d; are used interchangeably.</p>
<p id="p-0103" num="0215">The term &#x201c;water-insoluble&#x201d; as used herein means that the solubility in water at ambient temperature does not exceed 5% by weight, preferably 2% by weight, more preferably 1% by weight of the ingredient in question. Excluded are ingredients capable of forming a colloidal suspension in water at any temperatures between ambient and 100&#xb0; C.</p>
<p id="p-0104" num="0216">The terms &#x201c;melt&#x201d;, &#x201c;melting&#x201d; or &#x201c;melted&#x201d; are used herein in reference to a reduction in the viscosity of a biocide and/or a thermoplastic by application of sufficient heat and/or shear force and/or compression to enable intimate mixing. For example, many thermoplastics display shear thinning, i.e. a reduction in viscosity with increasing applied shear force, with the result that the ingredients, once &#x201c;melted&#x201d;, may be mixed at temperatures below the glass transition temperatures (Tg) or Vicat softening temperature (VST) of the thermoplastic.</p>
<p id="p-0105" num="0217">The term &#x201c;melt&#x201d; should not be confused with &#x201c;melting point&#x201d;, abbreviated M.p. and used herein in reference to the melting temperature of the biocide. M.p. values are taken from The Pesticide Manual (17th Edition, British Crop Protection Council).</p>
<p id="p-0106" num="0218">The term &#x201c;glass transition temperature&#x201d; (Tg) as used herein is applied to the thermoplastic of the composition and refers to the temperature (range) over which the thermoplastic undergoes a glass transition, i.e. a transition from hard and brittle to soft and deformable. Tg may be determined by means of differential scanning calorimetry (DSC), preferably at a heating rate of 10 K/min, wherein Tg is the mid-point temperature in the glass transition. The glass transition temperatures (Tg) referred to herein can be determined according to ISO 11357-2:2020.</p>
<p id="p-0107" num="0219">The term &#x201c;Vicat softening temperature&#x201d; as used herein refers is the determination of the softening point for materials that have no definite melting point, such as plastics. VST is an engineering term and is generally determined as the temperature at which a flat-ended needle of 1 mm<sup>2 </sup>circular cross-section will penetrate a thermoplastic specimen to a depth of 1 mm under a given load (e.g. 10 or 50 N) when the plastic is subjected to heating at a specified rate (e.g. 50 or 120&#xb0; C./h). The VST values referred to herein can be determined according to ISO 306:2013. The term &#x201c;Vicat softening temperature&#x201d; and &#x201c;Vicat softening point&#x201d; are used interchangebably.</p>
<p id="p-0108" num="0220">The term &#x201c;mixing&#x201d; as used herein refers to intimate mixing of a biocide, thermoplastic and/or embrittling agent, which leads to the formation of a composite; it can be achieved, e.g., by &#x201c;hot melt mixing&#x201d; after melting of one or more ingredients, or by &#x201c;solvent precipitation&#x201d; or &#x201c;solvent casting&#x201d; after dissolving of one or more ingredients in a separate organic solvent. Hence, the term &#x201c;mixing&#x201d; is different from the terms &#x201c;blending&#x201d; and &#x201c;mingling&#x201d;, which are used herein to refer to other means of combining and intermingling ingredients, generally in dry form, but that do not result in the formation of a composite.</p>
<p id="p-0109" num="0221">The term &#x201c;composite&#x201d; as used herein refers to a material formed from two or more constituent materials (individual ingredients) after &#x201c;hot melt mixing&#x201d; or &#x201c;solvent precipitation&#x201d; or &#x201c;solvent casting&#x201d;, in case of this invention i.e. a biocide and a thermoplastic, a biocide and a thermoplastic and an embrittling agent (&#x201c;friable biocide-composite&#x201d;), or a biocide and an embrittling agent (&#x201c;solidified biocide-composite&#x201d;). Within the finished composite, the individual ingredients are associated together in a unified form.</p>
<p id="p-0110" num="0222">The term &#x201c;solid biocide-composite&#x201d; as used herein refers to the state of matter of the biocide-composite.</p>
<p id="p-0111" num="0223">The term &#x201c;particle&#x201d; as used herein refers to discrete sub-portion of a biocide-composite or an ingredient thereof when present in a solid physical state. The terms &#x201c;particle&#x201d; or &#x201c;particles&#x201d; and &#x201c;particulate form&#x201d; are used interchangeably.</p>
<p id="p-0112" num="0224">The particle size &#x201c;Dv90&#x201d; as used herein refers to the maximum particle diameter below which 90% of the sample volume exists. Similarly, the particle size &#x201c;Dv10&#x201d; as used herein refers to the maximum particle diameter below which 10% of the sample volume exists. Other equivalent values can be used, e.g. Dv50 referring to 50% of the sample volume.</p>
<p id="p-0113" num="0225">Methods of determining the particle size are commonly known. An introduction to particle size measurements and the abovementioned values is provided in the technical document &#x201c;A basic guide to particle characterisation&#x201d;, published by Malvern Instruments Limited in 2015, and incorporated herein.</p>
<heading id="h-0006" level="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0114" num="0226">Biocide-Composite (Biocide+Thermoplastic and/or Embrittling Agent)</p>
<p id="p-0115" num="0227">The present invention provides a biocide-composite comprising a) at least one biocide and b) at least one non-biocidal solid independently selected from the group consisting of a thermoplastic, an embrittling agent, or combinations thereof.</p>
<p id="p-0116" num="0228">Surprisingly, the inventors have found that the biocide-composites of the invention are able to achieve very high biocide retentions in a glueline-treated glued-wood product after hot-pressing or hot-pressing and block-stacking.

<p id="p-0262" num="0373">Within the thermoplastic polymer families exemplified in Table 1 and within other suitable families there exist many suitable homopolymers.</p>
<p id="p-0263" num="0374">For example, many suitable grades of polyethylene and polypropylene are homopolymers exhibiting a broad range of properties arising from differences in density, molecular weight, crystallinity, branching and stereospecificity derived from different methods of synthesis.</p>
<p id="p-0264" num="0375">As another example methacrylate homopolymers including polymethyl methacrylate, polyethyl methacrylate, polyisopropyl methacrylate, polyisobutyl methacrylate, poly(sec-butyl methacrylate) and poly(tert-butyl methacrylate) are all suitable for the invention. Poly (tert-butyl acrylate) and related acrylate homopolymers with a Tg of 45&#xb0; C. or more or a VST of 45&#xb0; C. or more are also suitable. Polymethyl methacrylate is a preferred member of the poly(meth)acrylate family for the purposes of the invention but other family members are also suitable. Suitable homopolymers may be linear or branched and of widely varying molecular weights.</p>
<p id="p-0265" num="0376">Beyond the basic homopolymers exemplified in Table 1, there are many related water-insoluble copolymers of widely varying degrees of complexity suitable for the invention. In general, suitable copolymers may comprise monomers from the same chemical family (e.g., polyethylene polymerised with propylene and higher &#x3b1;-olefin comonomers, polymethacrylates containing different methacrylate monomers), or they may comprise monomers from different chemical families including monomers from polymer families exemplified in Table 1 (e.g. styrene acrylonitrile). Two, three or more different monomers in varying ratios may be used depending on the particular properties required. Copolymers of varying monomer distribution (i.e. random, alternating, block, graft) are also suitable for the invention. For example, acrylonitrile butadiene styrene (ABS, Table 1) is a ternary graft copolymer based on the styrene and acrylonitrile monomers, which impart stiffness, and polybutadiene which imparts flexibility to the copolymer.</p>
<p id="p-0266" num="0377">Also suitable for the invention are sidechain modified polymers such as polyvinyl butyral (Tg 60-63&#xb0; C.).</p>
<p id="p-0267" num="0378">In addition, the water-insoluble thermoplastic may include a biopolymer comprising a cellulose ether such as ethyl cellulose (VST 152-162&#xb0; C.), a cellulose ester such cellulose acetate (VST 70&#xb0; C.) and derivatives thereof including cellulose acetate butyrate (VST 70&#xb0; C.), cellulose acetate propionate (VST 100&#xb0; C.) and the like, polylactide or polylactic acid (PLA, VST 55-63&#xb0; C.), and a water-insoluble protein like zein (Tg 139&#xb0; C.), or a high melting point wax such as bees wax (Tg 64&#xb0; C.) and Carnauba wax (Tg 82&#xb0; C.), and biopolymer blends.</p>
<p id="p-0268" num="0379">Also suitable for the invention are thermoplastic aliphatic and aromatic hydrocarbon resins which have Tg values ranging from about 85&#xb0; C. to about 170&#xb0; C. depending on their composition and molecular weight.</p>
<p id="p-0269" num="0380">Further thermoplastic polymers suitable for the invention are included in US EPA polymer exemptions for pesticide chemical formulations in CFR document &#x201c;&#xa7; 180.960 Polymers; exemptions from the requirement of a tolerance&#x201d; published by a number of websites including https://www.law.cornell.edu/cfr/text/40/180.960.</p>

<p id="p-0280" num="0391">A wide range of thermoplastics are suitable for use in forming the composites of the invention. In one embodiment the thermoplastic is water-insoluble.</p>
<p id="p-0281" num="0392">In one embodiment, the thermoplastic has a glass transition temperature (Tg) of 45&#xb0; C. or more, or a Vicat softening temperature (VST) of 45&#xb0; C. or more.</p>
<p id="p-0282" num="0393">In one embodiment the thermoplastic is a water-insoluble polymer having a glass transition temperature (Tg) of from 45&#xb0; C. to 300&#xb0; C., or having a Vicat softening temperature (VST) of from 45&#xb0; C. to 300&#xb0; C.</p>

<heading id="h-0011" level="2">Embrittling Agent</heading>
<p id="p-0284" num="0395">The particle size of the biocide-composites of the invention is critical in order to obtain optimal results in terms of biocide retention and biocide distribution in glued-wood products. Therefore, it is important that the biocide-composites can be accurately milled into the desired particle size.</p>
<p id="p-0285" num="0396">The present inventors have surprisingly found that the inclusion of an embrittling agent into a biocide-composite of the invention comprising said biocide, either alone or together with said thermoplastic, results in a significant increase in the friability of the biocide-composite of the invention. A higher friability is advantageous since less milling steps are necessary to move from coarse to fine particles, accompanied by reduced heat generation and/or less need for cryomilling. It also facilitates the production of finer particles, allows wet milling in place of dry milling, reduced milling equipment and ultimately operational costs.</p>
<p id="p-0286" num="0397">A wide range of embrittling agents are suitable for forming biocide composites with said at least one biocidal compound. In one embodiment the embrittling agent is a water-insoluble solid.</p>
<p id="p-0287" num="0398">The embrittling agents used in the composition of the present invention are known and include but are not limited to, for example ground or crushed minerals, natural products and synthetic materials.</p>

<p id="p-0289" num="0400">Suitable modified clays include clays chemically modified using inorganic acids, bases and salts, exfoliated clays, calcined clays and organoclays. In organoclays, the original interlayer cations are exchanged for organocations such as quaternary alkylammonium ions so that an organophilic surface is generated, consisting of covalently linked organic moieties. The lamellar structure remains analogous to the parent phyllosilicate. Organoclays can be manufactured, e.g., using organic surfactants&#x2014;besides a wide range of different alkyl ammonium ions, also various organic acids, amines, amides and other compounds with charged or reactive groups including polymerisation precursors such as vinyl monomers can be used.</p>
<p id="p-0290" num="0401">Further suitable minerals include other silicates, diatomaceous earth, pumice, limestone, chalks, calcium carbonate, calcite, dolomite, gypsum, feldspar, alumina, perlite, powdered coal or sulphur, ground ceramic, ground glass and ground volcanic rock.</p>

Various dry forms of lignocellulosic biomass, agricultural waste products such as straw, stalks, leaves, cobs, husks, coconut kernel, etc. may also be used. Other suitable products include charcoal, activated carbon, synthetic minerals and the like.</p>

<p id="p-0299" num="0410">In one embodiment, the at least one non-biocidal solid is an embrittling agent. This type of biocide-composite is sometimes referred to herein as a &#x201c;solidified biocide-composite&#x201d;. In this type of biocide-composite, the biocide itself effectively acts as a binder or bridging agent in and around fragments of the embrittling agent&#x2014;but it is not a requirement that the biocide becomes incorporated within the pores and/or interstices of the embrittling agent. It is a combination that readily crumbles when milled.</p>

<p id="p-0341" num="0450">When forming the biocide-composites of the invention by hot melt mixing, the thermoplastic or the biocide is melted to provide at the end of processing a solid medium within which the other ingredients are incorporated.</p>
<p id="p-0342" num="0451">In the case of a &#x201c;biocide-composite&#x201d; comprising biocide and thermoplastic, or a &#x201c;friable biocide-composite&#x201d; (biocide+thermoplastic+embrittling agent), the temperature is increased to equal to or greater than the Tg or VST of the thermoplastic to enable intimate mixing with the biocide (and embrittling agent). The temperature does not need to be greater than the M.p. of the biocide to form a biocide-composite but melting of the biocide is generally likely to be beneficial.</p>
<p id="p-0343" num="0452">In the case of a &#x201c;solidified biocide-composite&#x201d; (biocide+embrittling agent), the temperature is increased to equal to or greater than the M.p. of the biocide, which forms the solid medium within which the embrittling agent is incorporated when it has cooled.</p>
<p id="p-0344" num="0453">Generally, there is no limitation as to the nature of the association between the biocide and the thermoplastic and/or embrittling agent of the composite at a molecular or phase level. For example, the thermoplastic may be crystalline or amorphous, and the biocide may be crystalline, amorphous or molecularly dispersed within the thermoplastic. Accordingly, the composite can include, but is not limited to, a range of solid dispersions including eutectic mixtures, amorphous precipitates within a crystalline matrix of thermoplastic, solid solutions of various kinds in which the biocide is molecularly dispersed within a crystalline thermoplastic, glass suspensions of crystalline or amorphous biocide in amorphous thermoplastic, as well as glass solutions of molecularly dispersed biocide within an amorphous thermoplastic. These forms are well described in the literature, for example in Laitinen et al., &#x201c;Theoretical Considerations in Developing Amorphous Solid Dispersions,&#x201d; <i>Amorphous Solid Dispersions</i>, N.

<p id="p-0356" num="0465">While it is generally convenient to melt the (pelletized) thermoplastic first to facilitate subsequent mixing with biocide and embrittling agent, the biocide and the thermoplastic in the form of pellets, flakes, powders and the like can also be blended together before melting and mixing. A good blend of this type can be achieved when the ingredients are first reduced to a similar particle size.</p>
<p id="p-0357" num="0466">In one embodiment, the thermoplastic in pellet form may be melted first, the biocide may be introduced into the melted thermoplastic and the two ingredients are then mixed. The biocide may or may not melt when mixed into melted thermoplastic.</p>
<p id="p-0358" num="0467">It may also be convenient to blend the biocide and the powdered embrittling agent before combining with the melted thermoplastic, typically when using a continuous process like extrusion. The biocide may or may not melt when mixed along with the embrittling agent into the melted thermoplastic.</p>

<p id="p-0362" num="0471">The resulting solid biocide-composite of step c) is milled to obtain said biocide-composite in particulate form, and is milled to a particle size suitable for glueline addition as described below.</p>
<p id="p-0363" num="0472">Melting, mixing and cooling may be performed using any of the hot melt mixing equipment and processes described herein. For example, melting, mixing (and cooling) may be performed in a batch process, for example using heated mixing devices ranging from laboratory equipment such as a Rheomixer to process equipment including heated batch mixers, kettles, reactors, and blenders including for example a heated ribbon blender. Preferably the process is performed in a continuous operation using equipment capable of one or more of metering, heating, mixing, cooling and conveying, including for example metered heated paddle mixers, co-kneaders, dispersion kneaders and extruders. The melt-mixed material may then be solidified on a belt cooler for example and formed into flakes, granules, etc.</p>
<p id="p-0364" num="0473">Extruders can include ram extruders or, more typically, screw extruders. Suitable screw extruders generally comprise one or more feed mechanisms, each including a hopper or some form of metering device, a heated barrel which may be divided into zones operating at different temperatures, one or more screws within the barrel to apply shear forces to convey and mix the materials being processed, and a die or port at the barrel exit through which the material is formed into sheets or stands. Single screw extruders are widely used to manufacture pelletized plastics and for injection moulding. A twin screw extruder generally provides better mixing when combining different ingredients and may be more suitable for use in the present invention. Processing carried out using an extruder is known by various terms including hot melt extrusion (HME), compounding or melt compounding. The term &#x201c;hot melt extrusion&#x201d; is used herein to describe hot melt mixing performed using an extruder.</p>
<p id="p-0365" num="0474">Hot melt-mixed materials may be reprocessed one or more times to improve composite homogeneity or for other reasons such as introduction of additional ingredients. The end point of extrusion is cooled strands or, more typically, cooled pellets produced using a die cutter or pelletiser. Other methods produce flakes, granules, etc. Generally, all of these materials need further size reduction for use in the invention.</p>
<p id="p-0366" num="0475">The suitability of a particular biocide and thermoplastic for producing a composite by hot melt extrusion (HME) may be assessed principally by examining their calorimetric and solubility properties.</p>
<p id="p-0367" num="0476">The principle calorimetric properties determining suitability of a given thermoplastic for hot melt mixing include the glass transition temperature (Tg), which is characteristic of thermoplastic polymers that generally may be described as amorphous, and the Vicat softening temperature (VST) which is applicable to all suitable thermoplastic polymers including amorphous, crystalline and semi-crystalline polymers.</p>
<p id="p-0368" num="0477">Another very useful property known in the art is the melt flow index (MFI) which indicates the ease of flow of a thermoplastic melted at a specific temperature and measured as the mass passed through a capillary in 10 minutes. These data may be found in various publications including &#x201c;Polymers: A Property Database&#x201d;, 2<sup>nd </sup>edition, B. Ellis and R. Smyth (eds.), CRC Press, Boca Raton (2009) as well as in manufacturers' product data sheets.</p>
<p id="p-0369" num="0478">A given thermoplastic by itself may be extruded at about 20-140&#xb0; C. or more above the Tg or VST of the thermoplastic. In one embodiment the given thermoplastic by itself may be extruded at about 20&#xb0; C. above the Tg or VST of the thermoplastic. In another embodiment the given thermoplastic by itself may be extruded at about 140&#xb0; C. above the Tg or VST of the thermoplastic. The processing temperatures for HME can be reduced by various means such as the addition of processing aids including solvents and plasticisers, and less commonly by blending polymers (thermoplastics) with different calorimetric properties prior to HME. The biocide itself can act as a plasticiser enabling lower processing temperatures. In some instances, a biocide may have the opposite effect thereby increasing the brittleness of the compounded material. While this may necessitate higher extrusion temperatures and/or torques, increased brittleness can also facilitate subsequent milling of the cooled extrudate.</p>
<p id="p-0370" num="0479">The choice of suitable thermoplastics must also account for the biocide degradation temperature. The temperature of the melted thermoplastic at the point of biocide addition can be any temperature up to the biocide degradation temperature, preferably at least 20&#xb0; C., and more preferably at least 40&#xb0; C. below the biocide degradation temperature. Biocide degradation temperatures are most conveniently determined by thermogravimetric analysis (TGA). Unless hot melt mixing is to be performed in an inert atmosphere, TGA should be performed in air to account for oxidative degradation. TGA can be performed according to ISO 11358-1:2014.</p>
<p id="p-0371" num="0480">A further consideration is the chemical compatibility of biocide and thermoplastic. While not wishing to be bound by theory, it is believed that solubility parameters of biocide and thermoplastic can indicate suitable matches based on mutual affinity. A number of solubility theories known in the art (Hildebrand, Hansen) can provide guidance following the general principle that like dissolves like or, more particularly, like seeks like. As an example, when considering the polar component of each material the following basic model provides a good indication of suitable (soluble and miscible) and unsuitable mixtures.</p>

<p id="p-0374" num="0482">When processed using extrusion equipment, some mixtures may be formed into tough extruded stands, other mixtures may be formed simply into agglomerated lumps. Both of these crude states can be wet or dry milled into readily dispersible materials suitable for the invention.</p>
<p id="p-0375" num="0483">Comminution may be achieved as described herein below, e.g., by wet or dry milling. Comminution of the solid biocide-composite is generally required to form readily dispersible mixtures suitable for glueline addition as described herein.</p>
<p id="p-0376" num="0484">When hot melt mixing with an extruder, the various temperatures occurring in the extruder may vary within a large temperature range; in general, in a range from 45&#xb0; C. to 300&#xb0; C. Depending on the thermoplastic and the biocide used, a temperature of from 45&#xb0; C. to 260&#xb0; C. is preferably employed.</p>

<p id="p-0382" num="0495">The non-aqueous solvent should be used in sufficient quantity to dissolve biocide and thermoplastic components and enable thorough mixing and integration of embrittling agents before precipitation or casting of the composites of the invention. Preferably, the solvent is volatile in this instance.</p>
<p id="p-0383" num="0496">In one embodiment, the biocide-composites of the invention comprising at least one biocide and at least one thermoplastic are formed in the ratios outlined above by dissolving a biocidal active ingredient and a thermoplastic in a non-aqueous solvent, mixing to homogeneity, followed by precipitation or casting.</p>

<p id="p-0385" num="0502">A wide range of non-aqueous solvents may be used depending on the chosen biocide and thermoplastic. Ingredients may be combined in any order but generally a minimal volume of solvent is provided first in order to facilitate agitation during solids addition. Heat may be applied to increase the rate and degree of dissolution.</p>
<p id="p-0386" num="0503">Once the biocide and thermoplastic have fully dissolved and mixed, the temperature may be reduced to bring about co-precipitation of dissolved material.</p>
<p id="p-0387" num="0504">In one embodiment, the mixture may be combined with a poor solvent or a non-solvent to initiate precipitation (sometimes called coacervation).</p>
<p id="p-0388" num="0505">Solvent casting is performed by dissolution of ingredients in a highly volatile solvent, optional partial evaporation of the solvent then pouring a film, generally on a moving belt, to maximise evaporation of remaining solvent. One consideration in choosing suitable (initial) solvents for either method is to ensure a consistent mutual solubility of biocide and thermoplastic, i.e. to avoid partitioning the biocide into the liquid phase during precipitation or solvent evaporation. As discussed above solubility theories will assist in choosing appropriate matches for biocide and thermoplastic with the additional consideration being the liquid solvent in which both solids must be dissolved at the start of the precipitation and casting processes.</p>
<p id="p-0389" num="0506">Solidified biocide-composites of the invention comprising at least one biocide and an embrittling agent may likewise be formed by dissolving the at least one biocide in a non-aqueous solvent and mixing with the embrittling agent then removing the solvent from the mixture. The resulting material is generally milled to a particle size suitable for glueline addition as described below.</p>
<p id="p-0390" num="0507">Solidified biocide-composites may also be formed without heat by using a non-aqueous solvent in sufficient quantity to dissolve the biocide and enable thorough mixing with embrittling agents. The liquid suspension is then cast as a thin layer to expedite solvent evaporation, fragmented and milled to a powder and, optionally, formulated as described below before use.</p>

<heading id="h-0017" level="2">Comminution and Classification</heading>
<p id="p-0392" num="0513">Irrespective of whether the biocide-composite of the invention is formed by a hot melt mixing process, or by solvent precipitation or solvent casting, all forms of the previously described biocide-composites according to the invention, including the friable and solidified biocide-composites, are generally reduced to smaller particles by some form of milling action based on grinding, cutting, shearing, etc., followed by screening and, where necessary, reprocessing of oversized particles. This may be done before or after combining the composite with other ingredients during formulation.</p>
<p id="p-0393" num="0514">Approximate particle sizes in any range suitable for the invention can be prepared from milled material using commercially available sieves, including for example sieves ranging from a US Standard Mesh No. 500 (25 &#x3bc;m nominal sieve opening) to a No. 30 (500 &#x3bc;m nominal sieve opening). A range of sizes with an approximate lower limit and an approximate upper limit may be prepared using two different commercially available sieves and keeping the fraction retained by the sieve with the smaller sieve opening. Various size ranges may also be produced during the milling operation using classifier mills, and gravitational and centrifugal air classification equipment, etc., as known in the art. Further size ranges may be produced by wet milling a suspension until the desired range is achieved. Particle sizes suitable for the present invention may be measured by microscopic examination and image analysis, or laser diffraction, etc. Laser diffraction is a preferred method of particle size analysis. Relevant ISO methods of measurement and presentation of particle size distributions include, for example, ISO 13320:2020 Particle size analysis&#x2014;Laser diffraction methods, and ISO 9276:2014 Representation of results of particle size analysis, which is split into multiple parts.</p>
<p id="p-0394" num="0515">The material may be milled dry or in the presence of a solvent that does not dissolve the thermoplastic or the biocide (non-solvent liquid), preferably water.</p>
<p id="p-0395" num="0516">Particle size reduction is required to ensure particles can be dispersed readily and evenly during formulation. Importantly, individual particles must be small enough to pass through any filters used in the mill during glue application. These filters can range in aperture size from about 250 to 500 &#x3bc;m. Thus a practical upper limit for the composite particle size is a Dv90 of 500 &#x3bc;m. Further suitable Dv90 values include 475, &#x3bc;m, 450 &#x3bc;m, 425 &#x3bc;m, 400 &#x3bc;m, 375 &#x3bc;m, 350 &#x3bc;m, 325 &#x3bc;m, 300 &#x3bc;m, 275 &#x3bc;m, 250 &#x3bc;m, 225 &#x3bc;m and 200 &#x3bc;m.</p>
<p id="p-0396" num="0517">A wide variety of dry milling equipment can be used including a hammer mill, pin mill, cutting mill, ball mill, disk mill, jet mill, classifier mill, and the like. Where necessary a cryomill operating with liquid nitrogen, dry ice, or other coolants may be used to increase brittleness. Suitable wet milling equipment may include a bead mill, shear pump, colloid mill, etc.</p>

<heading id="h-0018" level="2">Formulations</heading>
<p id="p-0415" num="0536">The biocide-composites according to the present invention may be formulated into any suitable formulation that facilitates their handling, storage and incorporation into the glue during glue-line treatment.</p>
<p id="p-0416" num="0537">All forms of the previously described composite according to the invention, including the friable and solidified biocide-composites, may be used in powdered form without addition of further ingredients, or may be combined with further ingredients and formulated according to known methods. In one embodiment, more than one composite, each comprising a different biocide, may be formulated together. In one embodiment, two or more biocides may be combined within a single composite and optionally formulated.</p>
<p id="p-0417" num="0538">Formulation types and methods of formulating biocidal active ingredients in their native form are described, for example, in &#x201c;Chemistry and Technology of Agrochemical Formulations,&#x201d; D. A. Knowles ed., Kluwer Academic Publishers, Dordrecht (1998), and &#x201c;Pesticide Formulation and Adjuvant Technology,&#x201d; C. L. Foy and D. W. Pritchard eds., CRC Press, Boca Raton (1996), and &#x201c;Formulation Technology: Emulsions, Suspensions, Solid Forms,&#x201d; H. Mollet and A. Grubenmann, Wiley-VCH, New York (2001).</p>
<p id="p-0418" num="0539">The above mentioned methods of formulating may be adapted to the present invention by taking into account the chemical properties of the particular non-biocidal solids in use.</p>
<p id="p-0419" num="0540">In one embodiment, the biocide-composites according to the present invention are formulated into storage-stable liquid formulations for convenient use. Suitable liquid formulation types include suspensions and dispersions. In this case, suitable formulation media are limited to solvents and oils which are not a solvent for the thermoplastic or biocide components of the composite. Water is particularly suitable.</p>
<p id="p-0420" num="0541">In another embodiment, the biocide-composites according to the present invention are provided as solid powders or granules.</p>
<p id="p-0421" num="0542">The choice of formulation type depends on the properties of the glue or native resin used as the adhesive.</p>
<p id="p-0422" num="0543">The formulation may contain customary formulation additives, the functions of which are described in the previously mentioned publications. Such additives may include one or more fluids including water, non-solvent organic liquids and oils, surfactants, dispersants, emulsifiers, penetrants, spreaders, wetting agents, inerts, colloids, suspending agents, thickeners, thixotropic agents, polymers, glidants, acids, bases, salts, organic and inorganic solid matrices of various kinds, preservatives, anti-foam agents, anti-freeze agents, anti-caking agents, lubricants, stickers, binders, dyes, pigments, and the like.</p>
<p id="p-0423" num="0544">Formulations can be prepared using known methods involving blending and further processing of the composite and suitable customary formulation additives by means of dispersing, finely dividing, slurring, emulsifying, homogenizing, stirring, wet and dry milling, stabilising, drying, granulating, etc, in order to formulate for glueline addition.</p>
<p id="p-0424" num="0545">The formulated biocide-composite may be combined with conventional formulations comprising one or more biocides in a non-composite form as in a suspension concentrate (SC), an emulsifiable concentrate (EC), etc. Thus, for example, one or more fungicides may be presented as a conventional formulation such as a SC, and an insecticide may be presented as a formulated biocide-composite of the invention, both combined to provide a single product ready for use.</p>
<p id="p-0425" num="0546">In one embodiment, the composite is readily and evenly dispersible within the glue mixture.</p>
<p id="p-0426" num="0547">Further details of suitable formulation methods are provided in the examples.</p>
<heading id="h-0019" level="2">Glueline Treatments</heading>
<p id="p-0427" num="0548">The biocide-composites of the invention and formulations thereof are particularly suited for use in glueline treatment of glued-wood products.</p>
<p id="p-0428" num="0549">The biocide-composite of the invention may be incorporated directly into the glue or native resin component of hot pressed or hot-pressed and block-stacked glued-wood products. In this case, the biocide-composite of the invention may be blended directly into the native resin or the glue mixture at any time from resin production to use in the mill manufacturing the glued-wood product. It is a blend of glue and biocide that is then added to the wood component. For example, the composite may be added directly to the native resin or to the glue mixture at the resin plant and shipped as part of a ready-to-use glue mixture. In one embodiment, the composite may be added to the glue or native resin in the mill at any time before glue or native resin application during the layup operation.</p>
<p id="p-0429" num="0550">Direct glue addition may be performed by blending the biocide-composite into glue or native resin in the form of dry milled particulates, a powdered formulation or a liquid formulation of the milled particles. Dry forms of the composite may be added to dry resins or glue mixtures. Dry and liquid forms of the composite may be added to liquid resins or glue mixtures. Generally speaking, a liquid formulation of milled particles is more readily blended into liquid resins or glue mixtures.</p>
<p id="p-0430" num="0551">Hence, the present invention provides a glue for glueline treatment of glued-wood products comprising the biocide-composite of the invention, which is in the form of a powder, or in the form of a formulation as defined above.</p>
<p id="p-0431" num="0552">Direct glue addition is common in the manufacture of glueline-treated engineered wood products where the biocide-composite is blended into the glue or native resin before it is used. The glue-composite combination may be applied to constituent veneers by pumping, blending, extruding, soaking, dipping, spinning, atomising, spraying, pouring, rolling, foaming, or curtain coating, etc. Direct glue addition may also be used with reconstituted wood-based products.</p>
<p id="p-0432" num="0553">The biocide-composite of the invention may also be added to the wood via indirect glue addition. In this case the biocide-composite is added to the wood in a stream separate from the glue.</p>
<p id="p-0433" num="0554">When the biocide-composite is added before the glue, the biocide-composite is typically coated onto the wood component. When added concomitantly with the glue, both the glue and biocide will coat the wood component more or less together. When the biocide-composite is added after the glue, the biocide generally first encounters the glue, then merges into the glue and meets the underlying wood component.</p>
<p id="p-0434" num="0555">The three relative addition steps may be conveniently accomplished, for example, by the relative positioning of spray jets or spinning disks in a typical chip or strand tumbler where various ingredients are added to the wood component to provide a &#x201c;furnish&#x201d; which is spread onto a forming belt before hot pressing.</p>
<p id="p-0435" num="0556">Indirect glue addition may be practiced in the manufacture of engineered wood products by spraying, misting or otherwise coating the composite onto veneers before the layup operation.</p>
<p id="p-0436" num="0557">Indirect glue addition may be more common in the manufacture of reconstituted wood-based products where the composite may be applied to the wood raw material (&#x201c;furnish&#x201d;) by injection into a refiner, blow line, strand or chip tumbler, sometimes in mixture with waxes and other agents, prior to, at the same time as or after introduction of the glue mixture or native resin. This method of manufacture is widely used with isocyanate resins where it is necessary to minimise the extent and duration of exposure to water. It is also widely practiced with a range of other resin types where blending of a number of ingredients is required to provide a homogeneous mat prior to hot pressing.</p>
<p id="p-0437" num="0558">Direct and indirect glue addition of the biocide-composite of the invention result in distribution of biocide throughout the glueline during manufacture of a glued-wood product. The glueline may be planar as in an engineered wood product such as plywood or LVL, or it may be a complex network structure following the multifaceted surfaces of the wood flakes, strands, and fibres, etc., that make up reconstituted wood-based products. Due to the unique beneficial properties of the biocide-composites of the invention, direct and indirect glue addition techniques as described above both result in dispersion of the composite throughout the glue zone of the glued-wood product.</p>
<p id="p-0438" num="0559">Glues and native resins within the scope of the invention include thermoset polymers including phenolic resins comprising novolac-type and resole-type phenol-formaldehyde (PF) resins, resorcinol-formaldehyde resins and phenol-resorcinol-formaldehyde resins, and amino resins including hydroxymethyl or alkoxymethyl derivatives of urea, melamine, benzoguanamine, and glycoluril, chiefly urea-formaldehyde, melamine-formaldehyde, and melamine-urea formaldehyde resins. Also included are isocyanate resins based on (partially) polymerised diisocyanates, mainly polymeric diphenylmethane diisocyanate (pMDI), thermoset epoxy and polyurethane resins, PVAs, as well as adhesives based on biomaterials including proteins, starches and lignocellulosic extractives such as lignins. The thermoset resins comprising the glue component are to be distinguished from the thermoplastic polymers used to prepare the biocide-composite described herein.</p>
<p id="p-0439" num="0560">Native resins such as isocyanate resins like polymeric diphenylmethane diisocyanate (pMDI), can be used as is, but most resins are applied to the wood component in mixture with water, wetting agents, inorganic and organic fillers and extenders (generally lignocellulosic residues), catalysts, plasticisers and additives with various other functions. As such they are termed &#x201c;glue mixtures&#x201d; or simply glues. The native resins and derived glue mixtures may be in a liquid or powdered state when combined with the biocide-composite of the invention.</p>
<p id="p-0440" num="0561">Glued-wood products wherein the glue is treated using the biocide-composites of the invention are manufactured by conventional means using standard manufacturing equipment. No changes in methods of hot pressing or hot pressing and block stacking are required to practice the invention.</p>
<p id="p-0441" num="0562">The biocide-composites of the invention are applied to the resin, glue mixture or furnish, in sufficient quantities to achieve the desired retentions of biocidal ingredients in the glued-wood product taking into account the relative amounts of glue and wood component, and any analytical losses that may occur during hot pressing or hot pressing and block stacking. The biocide loading is generally determined by calculation and is therefore a nominal value.</p>
<p id="p-0442" num="0563">Minimum retentions of biocidal ingredients are generally specified with reference to a particular &#x201c;hazard class&#x201d; for the finished product, i.e. a category relating to the durability of the product in a defined geographical area, the location of the product in a building or structure, its exposure to moisture, proximity to the ground, etc.</p>
<p id="p-0443" num="0564">Minimum retentions, methods of extraction and analysis as well as other requirement are set by standards or code marks and by organisations such as Australasian Wood Preservation Committee, American Wood Preservers Association, Japanese Industrial Standards, EN Standards, etc. Relevant standards include AS/NZS 1604.4:2006 &#x201c;Specification for preservative treatment Laminated veneer lumber (LVL)&#x201d; and AS/NZS 1605.3:2006 &#x201c;Methods for sampling and analysing timber preservatives and preservative-treated timber.&#x201d;</p>

Preparation of Hot-Pressed or Hot-Pressed and Block-Stacked Plywood with Biocide-Composite Containing Glues
</p>
<p id="p-0463" num="0578">The biocide-composite containing glues were applied to seven rotary peeled veneers (wood species: <i>Pinus radiata, </i>300 mm&#xd7;300 mm&#xd7;3.2 mm). The glue spread rate was 200 grams of glue per square metre of veneer (200 g/m<sup>2</sup>). Nominal biocide loadings in the finished plywood, expressed as grams of active ingredient per cubic metre of plywood (gai/m<sup>3</sup>), are provided in Table 4. After cold pressing, the plywood layups were sawn into quarters or into halves and hot-pressed for 20 minutes at 140&#xb0; C. and approx. 16 MPa. After hot-pressing, the plywood portions were subjected either to:</p>
<p id="p-0464" num="0000">a) &#x201c;hot-pressed&#x201d; conditions only: allowed to cool to ambient temperature, or
<br/>
b) &#x201c;hot-pressed&#x201d; and simulated &#x201c;block stacked&#x201d; conditions: wrapped in aluminium foil and held in an oven at 100&#xb0; C. for the times indicated (see Table 4), before allowing to cool to ambient temperature.

<p id="p-0465" num="0579">Plywood samples were prepared as described above with either a commercially available imidacloprid SC (Permatek&#xae; IM130) or with a commercially available suspensible emulsion containing triadimefon, cyproconazole and bifenthrin (Azotek&#xae; GL).</p>

<heading id="h-0032" level="2">Analysis Method for Determining Preservative Retention in Treated Plywood</heading>
<p id="p-0467" num="0580">Plywood specimens were then cut into 20 mm&#xd7;20 mm squares, ground in a Wiley&#xae;Mill and analyzed. The analytical procedures used are presented in the Methods section above.</p>
<p id="p-0468" num="0581">Retention data produced by the methods, as specified, are expressed as % m/m, i.e. the mass of biocide as a percentage of the oven-dried mass of the wood test sample.</p>
<p id="p-0469" num="0582">Data in this form can be more readily evaluated as a percentage of the nominal loading, i.e. how much of the applied biocide is &#x201c;recovered&#x201d; after hot pressing or hot pressing and simulated block stacking. Data expressed as percentages of nominal loading also facilitates comparisons among different application rates. To calculate such recoveries for plywood, the nominal loading is first converted from gai/m<sup>3 </sup>to % m/m based on a plywood oven dry density of 450 kg/m<sup>3 </sup>according to the following formula:</p>
<p id="p-0470" num="0000">
<br/>
<?in-line-formulae description="In-line Formulae" end="lead"?>% m/m=gai/m<sup>3</sup>/450 kg/m<sup>3</sup>/10<?in-line-formulae description="In-line Formulae" end="tail"?>
</p>
<p id="p-0471" num="0583">The recovery is then calculated according to the formula:</p>
<p id="p-0472" num="0000">
<br/>
<?in-line-formulae description="In-line Formulae" end="lead"?>Percentage nominal loading=retention/loading&#xd7;100%<?in-line-formulae description="In-line Formulae" end="tail"?>
</p>
<p id="p-0473" num="0584">When imidacloprid was applied to the glueline of plywood as a suspension concentrate (Comp 1), the retention after hot pressing was acceptable (72.1% of the nominal loading) but dropped nearly 10-fold to 8.7% after simulated block stacking for 72 h (Table 4). This result clearly demonstrates one aspect of the problem to be solved by the present invention.</p>
<p id="p-0474" num="0585">When imidacloprid was applied as a composite containing Ethyl cellulose A (Glue 1) or Aqualon&#x2122; EC N-22 (Glue 2) rather than as a SC, the retentions were again acceptable after hot pressing but there were only small further reductions after simulated block stacking, i.e. the large reductions in retention after block stacking were overcome. This would enable a significant reduction in the imidacloprid application rate to achieve the same retention at the end of the manufacturing process.</p>
<p id="p-0475" num="0586">Bifenthin, triadimefon and cyproconazole gave retentions ranging from 55% to 63% of the nominal loading when applied as a suspensible emulsion (Comp 2), and these values dropped by a further 15-26% after block stacking. When these actives were applied as biocide-composites containing Aqualon&#x2122; EC N-22 (Glue 3), the bifenthrin and cyproconazole retentions were higher (70-81%) after hot pressing and the retentions after block stacking for 48 h either remained unchanged (cyproconazole) or dropped by less than 7% (bifenthrin and triadimefon).</p>

<heading id="h-0033" level="1">Example 3: Biocide-Composite Samples 6-9 (HME)</heading>
<p id="p-0477" num="0587">Imidacloprid has a degradation temperature of about 274&#xb0; C. (onset of weight loss, see the thermogravimetric analysis data in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>). Accordingly, the mixing of imidacloprid with any thermoplastic by hot melt extrusion (HME) should be performed at temperatures less than about 270&#xb0; C.</p>
<heading id="h-0034" level="2">Preparation of Biocide-Composite Samples 6-9 by HME</heading>
<p id="p-0478" num="0588">Imidacloprid (M.p. 145.3&#xb0; C.) was mixed with KIBISAN&#xae; PN-117C to produce biocide composites. HME was performed using a Labtech LTE 26-40 co-rotating twin screw extruder fitted with 26 mm general purpose screws operating at 300 rpm. Table 5 provides a list of extrusion parameters including the set temperatures for each zone of the extruder barrel proceeding from the main product inlet point (Feed zone) in the direction of product movement to the exit point at the die. In all experiments a circular die was used which gives rise to an extrudate in the form a thread. Imidacloprid and KIBISAN&#xae; PN-117C pellets were introduced at the rates shown in Table 5 using gravimetric feeders. KIBISAN&#xae; was introduced at the Feed zone while imidacloprid was introduced at zone 5 where the set temperature (200&#xb0; C.) was well below the insecticide's thermal degradation temperature. The extruded strands were cooled with water to ambient temperature, cut to pellet lengths of 1.3 mm (Biocide-Composite Samples 6-8) and 1.6 mm (Biocide-Composite Sample 9), cryomilled, sieved through a 106 &#x3bc;m screen, then further formulated to yield aqueous suspensions (see Example 4).</p>

Preparation of Hot-Pressed or Hot-Pressed and Block-Stacked Plywood with Biocide&#x2014;Composite Containing Glues (Effect of Sieve Fraction)
</p>
<p id="p-0480" num="0589">The pellets of Biocide-Composite Sample 8 were embrittled in liquid nitrogen, milled at 18,000 rpm using a Retsch ZM 200 Ultra-Centrifugal Mill fitted with a twelve tooth rotor and 0.50 mm mill ring sieve, then fractionated on a sieve shaker. Sieve fractions were prepared using Retsch 300 mm diameter sieves assembled using the following pan and nominal sieve openings: pan, 106 &#x3bc;m, 150 &#x3bc;m, 212 &#x3bc;m, 300 &#x3bc;m, 500 &#x3bc;m. A portion of Sample 8 weighing about 100 g was placed on the 500 &#x3bc;m sieve and the sieve assembly was shaken on a Endecott EFL 2000 sieve shaker for 10 minutes. The resulting sieve fractions (&#x3c;106 &#x3bc;m, 106-150 &#x3bc;m, 150-212 &#x3bc;m, 212-300 &#x3bc;m and 300-500 &#x3bc;m) were blended in Prefere&#xae; PF resin and evaluated as biocide-composite containing glue (glueline treatment) in plywood at a nominal imidacloprid application rate of 1,000 gai/m<sup>3</sup>. As a comparison plywood was also glueline treated at 1,000 gai/m<sup>3 </sup>using Velcloprid 200SC (Comp 3, Imidacloprid SC). The hot-pressed or hot-pressed and block-stacked plywood was prepared and analysed to determine imidacloprid retentions as described above.</p>
<p id="p-0481" num="0590">Imidacloprid retentions after hot pressing and after holding at 100&#xb0; C. for 72 h (simulated block stacking) were markedly higher in plywood specimens that were glueline treated with the biocide-composites than in plywood treated with the imidacloprid suspension concentrate (Comp 3, see <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref>). Moreover, the retentions increased in sieve fractions containing larger particles, thus providing beneficial ranges suitable for a wide variety of manufacturing conditions, e.g. glue filters at plywood mills can range in aperture size from about 250 to 500 &#x3bc;m.</p>

<heading id="h-0036" level="2">Preparation of Aqueous Biocide-Composite Suspensions of Samples 6-9</heading>
<p id="p-0482" num="0591">Aqueous biocide-composite suspensions were prepared as follows (see Table 6): Magnesium aluminum silicate was dispersed into about 40 volumes of water with high shear agitation, then combined with antifoam and dispersants/wetting agents to form a base mixture into which Biocide-Composite Samples 6-9 were dispersed with low shear agitation. The Surfactant pre-mix, comprising dispersants and wetting agents, is a 2:1 mixture by weight of tristyryl phenol-polyethylene glycol-phosphoric acid ester and polyethylene-polypropylene glycol, monobutyl ether. Xanthan gum was then added as a 1.5% dispersion in water, along with glycerol, potassium hydroxide and preservatives (BIT and MCIT) (Table 6). The ingredient quantities in Table 6 are expressed as weight % (wt %) based on the total weight of the aqueous suspension.</p>

<p id="p-0486" num="0593">The treated plywood containing Biocide-Composite Suspension 6A gave the highest retention immediately after hot pressing (0.0067% m/m) and the imidacloprid retentions only declined by 35% to 0.0044% m/m after 72 hours in the block stack simulation. Aqueous Biocide-Composite Suspension 6A is made of Biocide-Composite 6 which contains about 6 wt % imidacloprid and 94 wt % KIBISAN&#xae; PN-117C.</p>
<p id="p-0487" num="0594">Increasing the percentage of imidacloprid to approximately 10%, 20% and 30% in the biocide-composites diminished insecticide retentions after hot pressing and diminished the resistance to further reductions when held at 100&#xb0; C. (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref>). In all cases, the final values were well above the 0.0006% m/m minimum retention specified in AS/NZS 1604.3 and AS/NZS 1604.4.</p>
<p id="p-0488" num="0595">By comparison, imidacloprid formulated as a conventional suspension concentrate (Comp 4) produced a lower retention after hot pressing and this was further reduced when held at 100&#xb0; C. (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref>). Loadings considerably higher than 20 gai/m<sup>3 </sup>would be needed to meet the minimum retention when using an imidacloprid suspension concentrate (SC) under hot press and block stacking conditions such as these.</p>

Preparation of Hot-Pressed or Hot-Pressed and Block-Stacked Plywood with Glues Containing Biocide-Composite Samples 10-12
</p>
<p id="p-0503" num="0605">The &#x3c;106 &#x3bc;m sieve fractions of Biocide-Composite Samples 10-12 were blended with Prefere&#xae; PF resin and evaluated as glueline treatments in plywood at the nominal application rates presented in Table 11. Hot-pressed or hot-pressed and block-stacked plywood was prepared and analyzed for biocide retentions as described above.</p>
<p id="p-0504" num="0606">The time course in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>6</b></figref> shows that when bifenthrin is applied as a conventional SC or EC (Comp 6 and Comp 7), the bifenthrin retentions were 0.012 and 0.013% m/m respectively, after hot pressing (which is denoted at 0 hours on the x axis) and declined significantly after block stacking (denoted as 24, 48 and 72 hours at 100&#xb0; C.). The greatest reductions occurred during the first 24 hours. In contrast, when bifenthrin was applied as a biocide-composite comprising the thermoplastic KIBISAN&#xae; PN-117C (Sample 10), the retention after hot pressing was approx. 46% higher (0.018% m/m) than the SC and EC, and only declined by a small amount during block stacking. The net result was a doubling of the bifenthrin retention at the end of a full simulated manufacturing operation when using the composite rather than a conventional formulation. This would enable about 50% less bifenthrin to be used to achieve the same retentions, if applied as Biocide-Composite Sample 10 when compared to comparative SC and EC.</p>
<p id="p-0505" num="0607">Table 11 demonstrates how compounding with KIBISAN improved the retentions of bifenthrin, triadimefon and cyproconazole after simulated block stacking for 72 h. The retentions are presented as a percentage of nominal loadings, i.e. as a &#x201c;recovery&#x201d;, which is calculated as described above. Application of triadimefon as a biocide-composite (Sample 11) improved recoveries by about 20% compared to a conventional suspension concentrate (Comp 8) whether applied alone or in a 1:1 combination with equivalent cyproconazole formulations. Application of cyproconazole as Sample 12 improved recoveries by 4-5% when applied alone or in a 1:1 combination with equivalent triadimefon formulations (Table 11).</p>

<p id="p-0514" num="0614">For comparison Biocide-Composite Sample 8 was cryomilled in liquid nitrogen using the same mill configuration.</p>
<p id="p-0515" num="0615">A sieve analysis of each of milled sample was performed using the sieving procedure described in Example 3. The sieve fractions obtained from each friable biocide-composite were weighed. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>8</b></figref> shows the results of the sieve analyses and demonstrates the effect of addition of an embrittling agent (Tixogel MP 100) on the friability of the composites.</p>
<p id="p-0516" num="0616">Sample 8, which lacks any embrittling agent, heated quickly, softened and fused to the ring sieve when milled at ambient temperature and could only be milled successfully after pre-embrittlement in liquid nitrogen. The resulting distribution (open bars) was broad with the majority of the particles in the 106-150 &#x3bc;m and 150-212 &#x3bc;m sieve fractions.</p>
<p id="p-0517" num="0617">Addition of as little as 5 wt % (based on the total amount of the composite) of the embrittling agent Tixogel MP 100 (Sample 14) enabled milling at ambient temperature without significant heating or any ring sieve blockage. Addition of increasing percentages of embrittling agent resulted in redistribution of particles from larger to smaller sieve fractions such that the majority could be milled to &#x3c;106 &#x3bc;m in a single pass. In the absence of any thermoplastic, Solidified Biocide-Composite 18 (Sample 18) was the most readily milled composite (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>8</b></figref>).</p>
<p id="p-0518" num="0000">Preparation of Aqueous Suspensions from Samples 14-18</p>
<p id="p-0519" num="0618">The 106-150 &#x3bc;m and 150-212 &#x3bc;m sieve fractions from each of Samples 14-18 were combined to give a 106-212 &#x3bc;m fraction. Each combined sieve fraction was then formulated as an aqueous suspension by mixing with ingredients in the weight ratios shown above for Biocide-Composite Suspension 8A (Table 12). In addition, a 106-212 &#x3bc;m sieve fraction was prepared from Biocide-Composite Sample 8 (i.e. a biocide-composite with no embrittling agent) and formulated as an aqueous suspension using the same ingredients (Biocide-Composite Suspension 8B).</p>
<p id="p-0520" num="0619">Each aqueous suspension was divided in two. One half was stored at ambient temperature, the other was stored in a sealed vessel for 14 days at 54&#xb0; C., an accelerated storage procedure equivalent to 2 years at ambient temperature.</p>

<p id="p-0523" num="0621">The conventional SC (Comp 12) produced an acceptable retention (0.009% m/m) after hot pressing but this dropped markedly after simulated block stacking for 72 h (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>9</b></figref>). Biocide-Composite Suspension 8B (Sample 8 SAN 80% TIX 00% IMI 20% in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>9</b></figref>) yielded a slightly higher retention after hot pressing and there was no reduction after subsequent block stacking. The same retentions were achieved using the suspensions that had been stored for 2 weeks at ambient temperature or for 2 weeks at 54&#xb0; C.</p>
<p id="p-0524" num="0622">Substitution of 5 wt % of the thermoplastic with the Tixogel MP 100 embrittling agent (Sample 14 SAN 75% TIX 05% IMI 20% in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>9</b></figref>) produced a further increase in retentions after hot pressing and after hot pressing and holding for 72 h at 100&#xb0; C. compared to Sample 8. There was no deterioration in performance when Sample 14 was stored for 2 weeks at 54&#xb0; C. prior to use as a glueline treatment.</p>
<p id="p-0525" num="0623">Increasing the Tixogel content to 20 wt % (based on the total weight of the composite) (Sample 15 SAN 60% TIX 20% IMI 20% in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>9</b></figref>) gave similar retentions after hot pressing but reduced retentions after block stacking. Using more Tixogel and less KIBISAN (Samples 16-18) did not change the imidacloprid retentions in hot-pressed plywood compared to Comp 12 or Sample 8 (even after storage at 54&#xb0; C.) but the benefit after simulated block stacking was lost with these samples.</p>

Thermoplastic pellets were introduced at the Feed zone and a pre-blend comprising biocide plus embrittling agent was metered into the extruder at Zone 5. Extruded strands were water-cooled, pelletized, dried then milled at 18,000 rpm and ambient temperature using a Retsch ZM 200 Ultra-Centrifugal Mill fitted with a twelve tooth rotor and 0.35 mm mill ring sieve. A &#x3c;106 &#x3bc;m sieve fraction of each milled composite was prepared with a sieve shaker and, for experimental convenience, used directly in powdered form for glueline treatment of plywood.

The plywood was manufactured as described in Example 2 except that the dimensions of the veneers were 200 mm&#xd7;200 mm&#xd7;3.63 mm thick. The plywood layup comprising 7 veneers was sawn in half and hot pressed for 12 minutes at 145&#xb0; C. and about 10 MPa. After hot pressing, each half of the plywood was wrapped in aluminium foil, one half was allowed to cool to ambient temperature immediately (&#x201c;hot-pressed&#x201d;), while the other was kept at 100&#xb0; C. in an oven for 72 h before allowing to cool to ambient temperature.</p>
<p id="p-0539" num="0633">The treated plywood specimens were then cut into 20 mm&#xd7;20 mm squares, ground in a Wiley&#xae; Mill and analyzed for bifenthrin and etofenprox retentions as described under Methods.

<p id="p-0540" num="0634">The three bifenthrin-containing friable biocide-composites (Samples 24, 25 and 26) gave large improvements in recoveries compared to Talstar&#xae; 80 SC (Comp 16, Bifenthrin SC), especially after simulated block stacking, with the ACRYREX&#xae; CM-207-containing material (Sample 26) delivering the best performance (see <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>11</b></figref>). Significant losses of etofenprox occurred in plywood containing the conventional formulation (Comp 17, Etofenprox EC), whereas large improvements in etofenprox recoveries were obtained when using KIBISAN-containing Friable Biocide-Composite Sample 27 (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>11</b></figref>).</p>

<p id="p-0544" num="0637">When applied as a conventional SC (Comp 18) only about 20% of the applied fipronil was recovered from treated plywood after hot pressing and simulated block stacking whereas friable biocide-composites prepared with KIBISAN&#xae; or ACRYREX&#xae; CM-207 delivered significant improvements in fipronil recoveries (Samples 28 and 29, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>12</b></figref>). Large losses of trifloxystrobin when applied as Comp 19 (SC) were very significantly reduced when applied as friable biocide-composites using both STYRON 685D and KIBISAN&#xae; as the thermoplastic (Samples 30 and 31, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>12</b></figref>).</p>

<p id="p-0545" num="0638">HME and milling of friable biocide-composites were performed as described above using the biocides pyraclostrobin (M.p. 63.7-65.2&#xb0; C.), buprofezin (M.p. 104.6-105.6&#xb0; C.), emamectin benzoate (M.p. 141-146&#xb0; C.) and penconazole (M.p. 60.3-61&#xb0; C.), two different thermoplastics, along with either Tixogel MP 100 or TALC A325 (talc) as embrittling agent (see Table 16). Sieve fractions (&#x3c;106 &#x3bc;m) were used directly for plywood glueline treatments with the exception of Sample 34, which was a &#x3c;300 &#x3bc;m sieve fraction. The ingredient quantities in Table 16 are expressed as weight % (wt %) based on the total weight of the composition.</p>

<heading id="h-0055" level="2">Preparation and Analysis of Hot-Pressed or Hot-Pressed and Block-Stacked Plywood</heading>
<p id="p-0547" num="0639">Plywood was manufactured using Prefere&#xae; PF resin treated at 200 gai/m<sup>3 </sup>with suspension concentrates of pyraclostrobin (Comp 20, Pyraclostrobin SC), buprofezin (Comp 21, Buprofezin SC) and penconazole (Comp 23, Penconazole SC), and a soluble concentrate (SL) of emamectin benzoate (Comp 22, Emamectin benzoate SL) as conventional formulation reference samples, alongside the &#x3c;106 &#x3bc;m sieve fractions of the Friable Biocide-Composite Samples 32-35. Plywood was hot pressed and block stacked as described in Example 10. Buprofezin and penconazole retentions were analysed by GC according to the bifenthrin procedure in Methods, while the retentions of pyraclostrobin and emamectin benzoate were analysed according to their own procedures in Methods.</p>
<p id="p-0548" num="0640">When applied as a conventional SC (Comp 20), pyraclostrobin recoveries were about 40% and 20% after hot pressing and simulated block stacking but increased about 2-fold and about 3-fold, respectively, when applied as a Friable Biocide-Composite (Sample 32, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>13</b></figref>). Buprofezin was almost completely destroyed when applied as a SC (Comp 21) but recoveries were excellent when buprofezin was applied as a composite containing with STYRON&#xae; 685D and TALC A325 (Sample 33). Emamectin benzoate likewise gave very low recoveries as a conventional SC (Comp 22) but 30-40% recoveries when applied as a Friable Biocide-Composite (Sample 34, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>13</b></figref>). A modest increase in penconazole recovery was achieved after block stacking when applied as a Friable Biocide-Composite (Sample 35) compared to the conventional SC (Comp 23 Penconazole SC, Table 17).</p>
