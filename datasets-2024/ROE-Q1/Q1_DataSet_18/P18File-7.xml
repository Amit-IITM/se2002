<p id="p-0002" num="0001">The present invention relates to a tofu transfer mechanism that is applied to a production device for continuously producing tofu.</p>
<heading id="h-0002" level="1">BACKGROUND ART</heading>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">In related art, in order to produce tofu by coagulating soymilk, the tofu is produced by using a mold box in low-volume production, but in mass production, the tofu is continuously formed and produced without using the mold box such that the soymilk is coagulated while being conveyed by a conveyor. After forming, the tofu is cut into a predetermined size and then stored in packs. Various devices have already been provided as such tofu continuous production devices.</p>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">Many of the tofu continuous production devices in the related art include at least two conveyors, that is, a primary conveyor and a secondary conveyor, and further include a transfer mechanism that transfers the tofu from the primary conveyor to the secondary conveyor.</p>

<heading id="h-0005" level="1">SUMMARY OF INVENTION</heading>
<heading id="h-0006" level="1">Technical Problem</heading>
<p id="p-0006" num="0009">In the devices in the related art, a length of a transfer plate used in the transfer mechanism (a length of the tofu in a traveling direction) is long, which inevitably leads to an increase in a size of the continuous production device. For example, when sheet-shaped tofu transferred from a continuous coagulation machine on a primary conveyor side does not slide well, the device is likely to be clogged with the tofu at the transfer mechanism and thus a trouble is likely to occur. In order to solve such a problem, the device in the related art adopts a structure in which water is sprayed from a bottom side to cause the tofu to slide easily, or adopts a structure in which a difference in height between the primary conveyor and the secondary conveyor is increased to create a downward slope. However, the variation of properties of the tofu may cause the tofu to slide too much to crack and to break down during transferring, or not to slide and accumulate, which may require time and effort for frequent adjustment of the sprayed water or the like.</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0010">The present invention provides a tofu transfer mechanism and a tofu continuous production device that can be reduced in size and can prevent a trouble related to transferring of tofu.</p>

<heading id="h-0010" level="1">DESCRIPTION OF EMBODIMENTS</heading>
<p id="p-0080" num="0083">Hereinafter, embodiments of a tofu transfer mechanism and a tofu continuous production device according to the present invention will be described in detail with reference to drawings.</p>
<p id="p-0081" num="0084"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref> shows a side view of a tofu continuous production device, and particularly, (a) of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref> shows a tofu continuous production device <b>1</b> in related art and (b) of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref> shows a tofu continuous production device <b>1</b> according to one embodiment of the present invention. The tofu continuous production device <b>1</b> is a device for continuously forming and producing tofu by coagulating injected soymilk while conveying the soymilk by a conveyor, and includes a continuous coagulation machine <b>10</b>, a continuous forming machine <b>30</b>, and a transfer member <b>20</b>. As illustrated, the soymilk injected into the continuous coagulation machine <b>10</b> becomes sheet-shaped tofu T while being coagulated, is conveyed by a conveyor <b>13</b> driven by drive rollers <b>11</b> and <b>12</b>, and is conveyed toward the continuous forming machine <b>30</b>. The continuous coagulation machine <b>10</b> in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref> is a steel belt type continuous coagulation machine.</p>
<p id="p-0082" num="0085">In the continuous production device <b>1</b> of the present embodiment, the continuous coagulation machine <b>10</b> in the related art is used, but each of the transfer member <b>20</b> and the continuous forming machine <b>30</b> has a new configuration.</p>
<p id="p-0083" num="0086">The tofu to be produced by the tofu continuous production device <b>1</b> is, for example, a curd for thick deep-fried tofu, a curd for a tofu cutlet, a curd for deep-fried tofu, a curd for a deep-fried tofu burger, a curd for cotton tofu, a curd for soft cotton tofu, a curd for grilled tofu, a curd for dried-frozen tofu, a curd for a dried-frozen tofu cutlet, a curd for a dried-frozen silken tofu cutlet, or the like, but is not particularly limited. As used herein, the term &#x201c;Tofu&#x201d; is referred to as a concept that includes not only the sheet-shaped tofu T but also block-shaped tofu and a cake of tofu which are obtained by cutting the sheet-shaped tofu T.</p>
<p id="p-0084" num="0087">The sheet-shaped tofu T conveyed from the continuous coagulation machine <b>10</b> is transferred to the plate-shaped transfer member <b>20</b> in the same direction, and the transfer member <b>20</b> transfers the sheet-shaped tofu T to the continuous forming machine <b>30</b> that conveys the sheet-shaped tofu T in the same direction. That is, a rotation center axis of each of the drive rollers <b>11</b> and <b>12</b> of the continuous coagulation machine <b>10</b> is parallel to a center axis of each of rollers of the continuous forming machine <b>30</b>, and the drive rollers <b>11</b> and <b>12</b> of the continuous coagulation machine <b>10</b> and the rollers of the continuous forming machine <b>30</b> rotate in the same direction when the sheet-shaped tofu T is conveyed.</p>
<p id="p-0085" num="0088">Conveying speeds of conveyance surfaces of the continuous coagulation machine <b>10</b> and the continuous forming machine <b>30</b> are usually the same, but may be relatively different depending on conditions.</p>
<p id="p-0086" num="0089">The continuous forming machine <b>30</b> includes an upper endless conveyor <b>31</b>, a lower endless conveyor <b>32</b>, a crushing device <b>33</b>, and a leveling device <b>34</b>. The sheet-shaped tofu T is first conveyed by the lower endless conveyor <b>32</b>, crushed to a predetermined size by the crushing device <b>33</b>, leveled to a uniform height by the leveling device <b>34</b>, and naturally dehydrated without load. Thereafter, the crushed and leveled tofu is further dehydrated while being sandwiched between the upper endless conveyor <b>31</b> and the lower endless conveyor <b>32</b> in an up-and-down direction, and is conveyed to a downstream process. The above description is common to the devices in (a) of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref> and (b) of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0087" num="0090">Instead of a steel belt type, the endless conveyor <b>13</b> of the continuous coagulation machine <b>10</b> may be a rigid metal belt that is made of stainless steel, titanium, or the like, and that includes, at both ends, side walls made of flexible silicone rubber (for example, see JP3568193B2 or the like), or the endless conveyor <b>13</b> may be a food belt made of a resin whose surface is to be in contact with food and that includes a lower belt and side wall belts. In the food belt, a canvas made of a resin such as a polyester, or a wire made of metal is used as a core material, and a flexible resin such as a urethane resin or a vinyl chloride resin, or rubber is laminated and welded on a surface of the core material. Further, the endless conveyor <b>13</b> may be a Teflon belt in which aramid fibers are coated with a fluorine resin (for example, see JP4512663B1, JP4613252B1, or the like).</p>
<p id="p-0088" num="0091">As in a case of a steel belt, a diameter of the drive roller <b>12</b> at a rear end (the drive roller <b>11</b> at a front end in some cases) is set to a large diameter within a range of 300 mm&#x3c6; to 1500 mm&#x3c6;, preferably 500 mm&#x3c6; to 1000 mm&#x3c6;. In a case of the Teflon belt or the food belt, a diameter of the drive roller <b>12</b> at the rear end (the drive roller <b>11</b> at the front end in some cases) is 50 mm or more and preferably 50 mm to 300 mm, which is smaller than that in the case of the steel belt, but a larger diameter is advantageous because slipping can be prevented.</p>
<p id="p-0089" num="0092">As the endless conveyor <b>32</b> of the continuous forming machine <b>30</b>, there is used a resin filter fabric belt that is flat-wound at starting and rear ends and forms a bottom surface and side walls on a conveyance surface, a wire net belt (a glasses link belt conveyor, a flat flex conveyor, a chocolate conveyor, or the like) in which a wire made of metal such as stainless steel is woven, a perforated or non-perforated food resin belt (a Teflon belt or a food belt), or the like. The resin filter fabric belt is a resin filter fabric in which monofilaments of a fluorine resin, a polyester resin, a polypropylene resin, a polyethylene resin, or the like are woven into a plain weave, a twill weave, or the like (for example, see JP4004413B2 or the like). The endless conveyor <b>32</b> is not particularly limited as long as a material or form is a flexible and tough material capable of forming a knife-edge-shaped folding-back unit <b>42</b> whose diameter (thickness) is 5 mm or more and less than 50 mm (preferably 10 mm to 30 mm). Further, the endless conveyor <b>32</b> may be flat-wound at the starting and terminal ends, and may be vertically folded back at both ends on the conveyance surface as vertical walls are formed at both ends of a caterpillar that rotates on an inner side of the conveyor and supports the filter fabric on the conveyance surface (see, for example, JPH05-000089U, JP4269319B2, or the like).</p>
<p id="p-0090" num="0093">The transfer member <b>20</b> is a plate-shaped member made of stainless steel or a resin, and in particular, a front end thereof is formed to be sharp in a tapered shape, and a tip member made of a resin may be provided, for example, at a front end of a stainless steel plate so as to be in contact with the steel belt. The transfer member <b>20</b> preferably has a shape that allows the tofu to be transferred from the continuous coagulation machine <b>10</b> without being damaged. Further, it is preferable that a rear end of the transfer member <b>20</b> is also formed to be sharp in a tapered shape.</p>
<p id="p-0091" num="0094">The transfer member <b>20</b> is formed by members having a round bar shape, a triangular cross section, a hexagonal cross section, or the like in addition to the plate shape (for example, bars having a cross section shown in each of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>10</b> and <b>11</b></figref> that shows the folding-back unit to be described later), may be a form in which the plurality of these members are arranged side by side, a form of a knife edge type belt conveyor, or a form in which the members rotate automatically or freely (a roller type, a belt conveyor type, or the like), and is not particularly limited as long as the transfer member <b>20</b> is a member that does not easily hinder transferring.</p>
<p id="p-0092" num="0095">The sheet-shaped tofu T is, for example, sheet-shaped silken tofu, and is transferred from the continuous coagulation machine <b>10</b> to the continuous forming machine <b>30</b> while keeping a silken shape (silk tofu, soft tofu or the like). Further, the sheet-shaped tofu T may be coarsely crushed tofu (the cotton tofu, the soft cotton tofu, the grilled tofu, a curd for the tofu cutlet, a curd for the thick deep-fried tofu, or the like) coarsely crushed as appropriate by a crushing device which is provided, for example, in the vicinity of a terminal end of the continuous coagulation machine <b>10</b>, on the transfer member <b>20</b>, or in the vicinity of a starting end of the continuous forming machine <b>30</b>. The crushing device may be provided for any of coarse crushing, medium crushing, and fine crushing, and a leveling device may be provided after the crushing device.</p>
<p id="p-0093" num="0096"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref> shows a side view of a tofu continuous production device, and particularly, (a) of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref> shows a tofu continuous production device <b>1</b> in the related art and (b) of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref> shows a tofu continuous production device <b>1</b> according to one embodiment of the present invention. The continuous coagulation machine <b>10</b> in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref> is a food belt type continuous coagulation machine. The other configurations are the same as those in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0094" num="0097">Next, the plate-shaped transfer member <b>20</b> common to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref> and <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref> will be described. The transfer member <b>20</b> is disposed so as to bridge the terminal end of the continuous coagulation machine <b>10</b> and the starting end of the continuous forming machine <b>30</b> that faces the terminal end of the continuous coagulation machine <b>10</b>. In the device in the related art shown in each of (a) of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref> and (a) of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref>, water (fresh water) is sprayed onto the transfer member <b>20</b>, and the sheet-shaped tofu T is transferred from the continuous coagulation machine <b>10</b> to the continuous forming machine <b>30</b> while sliding on the transfer member <b>20</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0095" num="0098">As illustrated, in the device in the related art, a length of the transfer member <b>20</b> is long (for example, 500 mm or more), and when the sheet-shaped tofu transferred from the continuous coagulation machine <b>10</b> does not slide well, the device is likely to be clogged with the tofu at the transfer member <b>20</b> and thus a trouble is likely to occur. In order to solve such a problem, a structure is used in which the water is sprayed in a small amount to cause the tofu to slide easily, or a difference in height between the continuous coagulation machine <b>10</b> and the continuous forming machine <b>30</b> is increased to create a downward slope. However, when properties of the tofu change, the tofu slides too much to crack and to break down during transferring, or the tofu does not slide and accumulates, and thus time and effort is required for frequent adjustment of the sprayed water or the like.</p>
<p id="p-0096" num="0099">Since the device is a large-scale machine, for positions (positions in a front-and-rear direction and the up-and-down direction) of the continuous coagulation machine <b>10</b>, the transfer member <b>20</b>, the continuous forming machine <b>30</b>, and a next process device (a cutting device or the like), installation positions initially set and a layout determined during test operation are often directly used. However, when the installation positions and the layout are inappropriate, it is difficult to change the installation positions and the layout later and a lot of effort is required at the time of changing, and thus a quality adjustment range for the tofu tends to be limited.</p>

The result means that a difference in height between the continuous coagulation machine <b>10</b> and the continuous forming machine <b>30</b> can be reduced and inclination of the transfer member <b>20</b> can also be reduced. Therefore, it is possible to reduce a length and a height of the entire tofu continuous production device <b>1</b> and achieve space saving.

<p id="p-0143" num="0146">A hardness of the sheet-shaped tofu T transferred from the continuous coagulation machine <b>10</b> is, for example, 1 kN/m<sup>2 </sup>to 100 kN/m<sup>2</sup>, or preferably 20 kN/m<sup>2 </sup>to 10 kN/m<sup>2</sup>. Tofu does not have a shape retaining property and transferring itself is difficult when the tofu is soft, whereas hard tofu is advantageous for transfer and transferring is easy when the tofu is too hard.</p>
<p id="p-0144" num="0147">According to the tofu transfer mechanism <b>50</b> of the present embodiment, the distance between the continuous coagulation machine <b>10</b> and the continuous forming machine <b>30</b> is shortened, and the length of the transfer member <b>20</b> in the conveying direction is also shortened. Further, the difference in height between the continuous coagulation machine <b>10</b> and the continuous forming machine <b>30</b> can also be reduced and the inclination of the transfer member <b>20</b> can also be reduced. Therefore, it is possible to reduce the length and the height of the entire tofu continuous production device <b>1</b> and achieve space saving. As a result, for example, a space (height) occupied by the device in a factory can be reduced, a ceiling height can be lowered accordingly, construction cost can also be reduced, an amount of a steel material constituting the machine is also small, initial cost is reduced, and the device is excellent in economic efficiency.</p>
<p id="p-0145" num="0148">By reducing the length of the transfer member <b>20</b> in the conveying direction and the inclination angle of the transfer member <b>20</b>, the tofu can also be smoothly transferred, and the trouble such as the breakage of the tofu can also be prevented. It is also possible to reduce the water sprayed onto the transfer member <b>20</b>. Even when the water is sprayed onto the transfer member <b>20</b>, a small amount of water is required, the water can be saved, and an amount of discharged water can also be reduced to reduce burden on a purification tank. The device is economical because running cost is also reduced, for example, a work time and effort for performing fine adjustment on an amount of sprayed water according to a sliding condition of the tofu is reduced and work efficiency is improved.</p>
<p id="p-0146" num="0149">Since the sliding resistance when the sheet-shaped tofu T passes through the transfer member <b>20</b> can be reduced, even soft tofu that is not hard tofu is also likely to pass through the transfer member <b>20</b> stably. Generally, in order to make the tofu hard, means such as increasing a concentration of soymilk or increasing an addition amount of a coagulant is used. When the addition amount of the coagulant is increased, secondary coagulation is performed by heat sterilization, an amount of separated water from the tofu tends to increase, and an umami taste thereof also tends to escape. According to the present invention, it is possible to appropriately control the addition amount of the coagulant, and it is possible to provide tofu that is slightly soft but has elasticity, is increased in water retention capacity, small in taste loss even after heat sterilization, more delicious, smooth and improved in texture. When there is a change in tofu quality due to a difference in tofu product type or a change in soybean quality, the sliding behavior (the sliding resistance) on the transfer member may change. However, since the transfer member is small (a transfer distance is short), it is difficult for the tofu to break down or to stop and accumulate, the tofu is not easily affected, and the trouble and the loss can also be reduced. Since the tofu has the water retention capacity, an improvement in yield is also expected especially when the tofu is pressed and compacted like the cotton tofu or the like.</p>
