<?summary-of-invention description="Summary of Invention" end="lead"?>
<heading level="1" id="h-0001">FIELD OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0002" num="0001">The present invention relates to baby cribs, and in particular to the type of cribs having a drop side allowing babies to sleep with their parents by placing the crib on the bed side.</p>
<heading level="1" id="h-0002">BACKGROUND ART</heading>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">Various examples of bed-side cribs, also known as side-sleeping cribs, are known in the art. Like in all cribs, a baby is placed on a bottom of the crib, possibly equipped with a mattress, surrounded by side walls that prevent the child from coming out or falling outside.</p>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">In order to allow side-sleeping, i.e. with the baby safely sleeping next to his/her parents, one of the side walls is designed to be movable. Thus, the movable wall may be kept in the raised position during the day, or in any case when the crib is far from the parents&#x2019; bed, and may be dropped down at night, so as to remove any separation between the crib and the bed.</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">One example of bed-side cribs is disclosed in EP 3354165 by the applicant hereof. In this crib, the bottom and the side walls are defined by a textile enclosure supported by a frame. The movable wall of the enclosure is connected between a movable bar of the frame, placed above the wall, and a lower roller that is able to rewind the fabric of the wall while it slides downwards. Sliders are provided at the ends of the movable bar, sliding in respective guides.</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">Also, belts are provided under the bottom of the enclosure, which can be unwound from an additional roller, to secure the crib to a structural element of a bed.</p>
<heading level="1" id="h-0003">PROBLEM OF THE PRIOR ART</heading>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">The possibility of dropping down one of the walls of the crib poses a safety problem when the crib is far from a bed. This is because if the movable wall is not well secured in the raised position, or a baby is able to unlock the wall, or his/her parents don&#x2019;t pay attention, the crib may have an accidentally dropped-down wall even when it is far from the bed, and a baby may fall outside.</p>
<heading level="1" id="h-0004">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">The object of the present invention is to address the above problem, i.e. preventing the movable wall from remaining in the dropped-down position when the crib is far from a bed.</p>
<p id="p-0009" num="0008">This and other objects are fulfilled by a baby crib as defined in any of the accompanying claims.</p>
<p id="p-0010" num="0009">The invention provides a return system configured to return at least one slider of the movable bar along a respective guide toward an upper end portion of the guide, to thereby raise the movable wall. A constraint element adapted to be secured to a bed, e.g. similar to the belts of EP 3354165, is connected to the return system to be also returned toward the guides.</p>
<p id="p-0011" num="0010">When the constraint element is secured to a bed, the bed itself retains the constraint element, preventing it from being returned toward the guides. Therefore, despite the force exerted by the return system on the constraint element, further movements of the constraint element toward the guide are prevented, and at the same time the action of the return system on the slider of the movable bar is stopped.</p>
<p id="p-0012" num="0011">Advantageously, when the crib is fixed to a bed via the constraint elements, the movable bar is free to remain in the dropped down or raised position, as desired, without being subjected to the returning action that would automatically return it upwards. Conversely, when the crib is far from the bed, and as long as there is nothing else that retains the constraint element spaced apart from the guide, the return system will always automatically return the movable bar to the raised position, preventing a child from falling outside.</p>

<heading level="1" id="h-0006">DETAILED DESCRIPTION</heading>
<p id="p-0022" num="0021">Referring to the accompanying figures, numeral <b>100</b> generally designates a baby crib, namely a bed-side or side-sleeping crib. The crib <b>100</b> comprises a frame <b>1</b> and a textile enclosure <b>110</b>, which may be manufactured and sold together or separately.</p>
<p id="p-0023" num="0022">The frame <b>1</b> comprises an upper structure <b>2</b> and a lower structure <b>3</b>, spaced apart in a first direction X-X. The frame <b>1</b> further comprises uprights <b>4</b> that connect and fix the lower structure <b>2</b> and the upper structure <b>3</b> together. Preferably, the uprights <b>4</b> mainly extend in the first direction X-X.</p>
<p id="p-0024" num="0023">The frame <b>1</b> may also comprise a support structure <b>5</b> which is configured to rest on a floor and to keep the upper structure <b>2</b> and the lower structure <b>3</b> raised from the floor. In the illustrated embodiment, the support structure <b>5</b> comprises bearing legs <b>51</b> connected to the upper structure <b>2</b>. The bearing legs <b>51</b> are pivotally connected to the upper structure to allow the upper structure <b>2</b> and the lower structure <b>3</b> to rock.</p>
<p id="p-0025" num="0024">Nevertheless, a skilled person will understand that a variety of types of alternative support structures <b>5</b> may be provided for the purposes of the invention, e.g. with one or more legs forming extensions of the uprights <b>4</b> and formed of one piece therewith. Therefore, the support structure <b>5</b> will not be described in greater detail herein.</p>
<p id="p-0026" num="0025">In addition, the frame <b>1</b> comprises a movable bar <b>6</b>, which is movable with respect to the upper structure <b>2</b> and the lower structure <b>3</b>, in positions which will be explained in greater detail below. In particular, the movable bar <b>6</b> may be at times in an upper position, in which it is substantially level with the upper structure <b>2</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0027" num="0026">The movable bar <b>6</b> has two end portions <b>61</b> spaced apart in a second direction Y-Y perpendicular to the first direction X-X.</p>
<p id="p-0028" num="0027">When the movable bar <b>6</b> is in the upper position, the upper structure <b>2</b> and the movable bar <b>6</b> define together an upper opening. In certain examples, the upper opening may have a plurality of sides, preferably four, and the movable bar <b>6</b> is arranged along at least a portion of at least one of these sides. On the other hand, the upper structure <b>2</b> occupies the remaining sides and/or portions of a side of the upper opening.</p>
<p id="p-0029" num="0028">The lower structure <b>3</b> is configured to support a mattress <b>200</b>. The upper structure <b>2</b>, the lower structure <b>3</b> and the uprights <b>4</b> are in such arrangement as to surround a compartment of the crib <b>100</b> adapted to receive a baby. The compartment is accessible through the upper opening, and may also be accessible from the sides, depending on the position of the movable bar <b>6</b>, as further explained below.</p>
<p id="p-0030" num="0029">The enclosure <b>110</b> of the crib <b>100</b> delimits this compartment and is preferably constrained to the upper structure <b>2</b>. In particular, the enclosure <b>110</b> comprises a bottom <b>111</b> arranged substantially level with the lower structure <b>3</b>. The mattress <b>200</b> may be placed on the bottom <b>111</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0031" num="0030">Furthermore, the enclosure <b>110</b> comprises side walls <b>112</b> which connect the bottom <b>111</b> to the upper structure <b>3</b> of the frame <b>1</b>. Finally, the enclosure <b>110</b> comprises a movable wall <b>113</b> which is connected to the movable bar <b>6</b> and is movable with the movable bar <b>6</b>. The movable wall is arranged at least partially between the movable bar <b>6</b> and the bottom <b>111</b>. Therefore, at least when the movable bar <b>6</b> is in the upper position, the side walls <b>112</b> and the movable wall <b>113</b> laterally surround the compartment.</p>
<p id="p-0032" num="0031">The frame <b>1</b> comprises at least one guide <b>7</b>, preferably two guides <b>7</b>. Each guide <b>7</b> has a top end portion <b>71</b> proximate to the upper structure <b>2</b> and a bottom end portion <b>72</b> proximate to the lower structure <b>3</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0033" num="0032">In the preferred embodiment, each guide <b>7</b> is shaped like a guide bar that connects the upper structure <b>2</b> and the lower structure <b>3</b>. The guide bar has a groove <b>73</b> that extends between the upper end portion <b>71</b> and the lower end portion <b>72</b> for certain specific components to slide therein, as explained hereinafter. In particular, the movable wall <b>113</b> has side edges spaced apart in the second direction Y-Y and sliding each in a respective groove <b>73</b>. Optionally, the groove <b>73</b> provides access to a cavity <b>74</b> inside the guide bar, which also extends between the upper end portion <b>71</b> and the lower end portion <b>72</b>, for the sliding movement of additional components having a greater thickness than the movable wall <b>113</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0034" num="0033">The movable bar <b>6</b> comprises at least one slider <b>62</b> that is able to slide along the guide <b>7</b>, and is namely able to slide between the upper end portion <b>71</b> and the lower end portion <b>72</b>. The slider <b>62</b> can at least partially fit in the groove <b>73</b>, and optionally in the inner cavity <b>74</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0035" num="0034">Preferably, the slider <b>62</b> is formed on a respective end portion <b>61</b> of the movable bar <b>6</b>. More preferably, each end portion <b>61</b> of the movable bar <b>6</b> has a respective slider <b>62</b>, sliding along a respective guide <b>7</b>. Nevertheless, reference will be made herein to one guide <b>7</b> and one slider <b>62</b>, to describe features that apply to each guide <b>7</b> and each slider <b>62</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0036" num="0035">When the movable bar <b>6</b> is in the upper position, the slider <b>62</b> is at the upper end portion <b>71</b> of the guide <b>7</b>. Moreover, the movable bar <b>6</b> is movable between the upper position and a lower position, in which the slider <b>62</b> is substantially at the lower end portion <b>72</b> of the guide <b>7</b>. When the movable bar <b>6</b> is in the lower position, the compartment of the crib <b>100</b> is accessible not only from the upper opening, but also from a lateral opening located above the movable bar <b>6</b>, between the two guides <b>7</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0037" num="0036">In one aspect of the invention, the crib <b>100</b> comprises a return system <b>8</b> configured to return the slider <b>62</b> toward the upper end portion <b>71</b> of the guide <b>7</b>, and hence to return the movable bar <b>6</b> toward the upper position. More specifically, each guide <b>7</b> may have its own return system <b>8</b>, only one of them being described herein, or a single return system <b>8</b> may be provided in spite of the provision of multiple guides <b>7</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0038" num="0037">It should be noted that in prior art cribs, like the one of EP 3354165, unlike the crib of the invention, the movable bar <b>6</b> is returned toward the lower position, and not toward the upper position.</p>
<p id="p-0039" num="0038">Preferably, the return system <b>8</b> comprises a first roller <b>81</b> mounted to the upper structure <b>2</b>, close to the upper end portion <b>71</b> of the guide <b>7</b>. Furthermore, the return system <b>8</b> comprises a generally flexible upper connecting section <b>82</b> which can be wound around the first roller <b>81</b>. The upper connecting section <b>82</b> may be provided, for example, in the form of a belt or a rope. The first roller <b>81</b> is biased to rewind the upper connecting section <b>82</b> with a first force. When rewinding on the first roller <b>81</b> is not completed, the upper connecting section <b>82</b> extends at least partially along the guide <b>7</b>, for example in the cavity <b>74</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0040" num="0039">In embodiments that are not shown in the figures, the upper connecting section <b>82</b> may be connected to the slider <b>62</b>. Conversely, in the preferred embodiment the return system <b>8</b> comprises a stop member <b>83</b> sliding along the guide <b>7</b>, and particularly in the cavity <b>74</b>, or alternatively in the groove <b>73</b>. However, substantially parallel separate grooves or cavities may be provided in the guide bar for various components to slide therein, such as the slider <b>62</b> and the stop member <b>83</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0041" num="0040">If the stop member <b>83</b> is provided, the upper connecting section <b>82</b> connects the first roller <b>81</b> and the stop member <b>83</b>. Therefore, the first roller <b>81</b> and the upper connecting section <b>82</b> constitute return members, which are configured to return the stop member <b>83</b> toward the upper end portion <b>71</b> of the guide <b>7</b>. These return members <b>81</b>, <b>82</b> act only indirectly on the slider <b>62</b>, via the stop member <b>83</b>, as described below.</p>
<p id="p-0042" num="0041">In particular, the sliding movement of the slider <b>62</b> along the guide <b>7</b> is limited below by the stop member <b>83</b> and is also obviously limited above by the upper end portion <b>71</b> of the guide <b>7</b>. For example, the stop member <b>83</b> may be placed below the slider <b>62</b>, i.e. between the slider <b>62</b> and the lower end portion <b>72</b> of the guide <b>7</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0043" num="0042">The stop member <b>83</b> has a bearing portion <b>84</b> which is adapted to contact the slider <b>62</b> and press the slider <b>62</b> toward the top end portion <b>71</b> of the guide <b>7</b> when the return members <b>81</b>, <b>82</b> return the stop member <b>83</b> toward the top end portion <b>71</b> of the guide <b>7</b>. In any case, the slider <b>62</b> can be separated from the bearing portion <b>84</b> of the stop member <b>83</b>, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b></figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0044" num="0043">Therefore, when the slider <b>62</b> and the stop member <b>83</b> contact each other at the bearing portion <b>84</b>, the stop member <b>83</b>, which moves toward the upper end portion <b>71</b> of the guide <b>7</b> under the action of the return members <b>81</b>, <b>82</b>, pulls the slider <b>62</b> along. That is, the slider <b>62</b> is movable jointly with the stop member <b>83</b> substantially along the entire guide <b>7</b>, i.e. between the upper end portion <b>71</b> and the lower end portion <b>72</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0045" num="0044">Conversely, when the slider <b>62</b> is separated from the stop member <b>83</b>, it is only movable between the upper end portion <b>71</b> of the guide <b>7</b> and the stop member <b>83</b>, without being subjected to the action of the return members <b>81</b>, <b>82</b>. Therefore, when the slider <b>62</b> is separated from the stop member <b>83</b>, it is not allowed to be between the lower end portion <b>72</b> of the guide <b>7</b> and the stop member <b>83</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0046" num="0045">The frame <b>1</b> comprises at least one constraint element <b>9</b> (for example one for each return system <b>8</b> or for each guide <b>7</b>), which is configured to be secured to a structural element of a bed (not shown) in the vicinity of the crib <b>100</b>. The constraint element <b>9</b> may have different shapes depending on the desired bed fixation arrangements. In the preferred embodiment, the constraint element <b>9</b> comprises one or more belts that can be fixed around a bar or beam of the bed.</p>
<p id="p-0047" num="0046">According to one aspect of the invention, the constraint element <b>9</b> is constrained to the guide <b>7</b> and is connected to the return system <b>8</b>, namely to the stop member <b>83</b>. That is, the return system <b>8</b> comprises a lower connecting section <b>85</b> which connects the constraint element <b>9</b> and the stop member <b>83</b>. The lower connecting section <b>85</b> may be provided, for example, in the form of a belt or a rope, optionally as an extension of the upper connecting section <b>82</b>. Nevertheless, in the illustrated embodiment, the upper <b>82</b> and lower <b>85</b> connecting sections comprise distinct belts, whose thicknesses are oriented in mutually perpendicular directions.</p>
<p id="p-0048" num="0047">It should be noted that the connection between the constraint element <b>9</b> and the lower connecting section <b>85</b> may be either permanent or releasable, for example by means of a clip. Namely, in the illustrated embodiment, a first clip <b>86</b> removably connects a first end of the constraint element <b>9</b> to the lower connecting section <b>85</b>, and a second clip <b>87</b> removably connects a second end of the constraint element <b>9</b> to a portion of the lower structure <b>3</b> that is distal from the guide <b>7</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0049" num="0048">On the other hand, in the permanent connection case, the constraint element <b>9</b> and the lower connection section <b>85</b> may be simply defined as distinct portions of the same belt or rope, or the constraint element <b>9</b> may be directly connected to the stop member <b>83</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0050" num="0049">The lower connecting section <b>85</b> (and/or a portion of the constraint element <b>9</b>) is adapted to be at least partially inserted into and removed from the guide <b>7</b>, namely the cavity <b>74</b>, as the stop member <b>83</b> slides along the guide <b>7</b>. For this purpose, the guide <b>7</b> has a first lower channel <b>75</b> for access to the cavity <b>74</b>, at the lower end portion <b>72</b> of the guide <b>7</b>. The lower connecting section <b>85</b> extends through the first lower channel <b>75</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0051" num="0050">As a result, the constraint element <b>9</b> is movable relative to the guide <b>7</b> between a position close to the guide <b>7</b>, when most of the lower connecting section <b>85</b> is inserted in the guide <b>7</b>, and a position spaced apart from the guide <b>7</b>, when most of the lower connecting portion <b>85</b> is outside the guide <b>7</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0052" num="0051">By securing the constraint element <b>9</b> to a structural element of a bed, the bed may be easily arranged to retain the constraint element <b>9</b> in the position spaced apart from the guide <b>7</b>. When the constraint element <b>9</b> is retained in the spaced-apart position (whether or not this occurs by securing the constraint element to a bed), the stop member <b>83</b> is still pulled by the return members <b>81</b>, <b>82</b> toward the upper end portion <b>71</b> of the guide <b>7</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0053" num="0052">Nevertheless, in such situation the stop member <b>83</b> can no longer slide toward the upper end portion <b>71</b> of the guide <b>7</b> and cannot press the slider <b>62</b> toward the upper end portion <b>71</b> of the guide <b>7</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0054" num="0053">Thus, a skilled person will understand that the connection as described hereintofore between the constraint element <b>9</b> and the various components of the return system <b>8</b> is such that the return system <b>8</b> will prevent the slider <b>62</b> from being returned, when the constraint element <b>9</b> is retained in the spaced-apart position. However, the movable bar <b>6</b> may still be raised, by detaching the slider <b>62</b> from the stop member <b>83</b>, as desired by a user.</p>
<p id="p-0055" num="0054">According to the intended purposes, when the crib <b>100</b> is moved away from the bed with the constraint element <b>9</b> not being retained in the spaced-apart position, the return system <b>8</b> will prevent the movable bar <b>6</b> from stably remaining in the lower position, and the slider <b>62</b> will be returned toward the upper end portion <b>71</b> of the guide <b>7</b> whenever the movable bar <b>6</b> is at least partially lowered.</p>
<p id="p-0056" num="0055">Furthermore, when the constraint element <b>9</b> is secured to a structural element of the bed while being retained in the spaced-apart position, the user may freely choose whether to keep the movable bar <b>6</b> in the upper position (slider <b>62</b> detached from the stop member <b>83</b> and placed at the upper end portion <b>71</b> of the guide <b>7</b>), or in a lower position (slider <b>62</b> resting on the stop member <b>83</b> at the lower end portion <b>72</b> of the guide <b>7</b>).</p>
<p id="p-0057" num="0056">Preferably, the movable bar <b>6</b> comprises at least one locking member <b>63</b> (preferably two), located at one of the end portions <b>61</b> of the movable bar <b>6</b>. Therefore, the locking member <b>63</b> may be placed proximate to the slider <b>62</b> and may be optionally mounted to the slider <b>62</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0058" num="0057">Accordingly, the upper structure <b>2</b> comprises a locking seat <b>21</b>, preferably formed in the vicinity of the upper end portion <b>71</b> of the guide <b>7</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0059" num="0058">The locking member <b>63</b> is adapted to be engaged, preferably by snap-fit engagement, in a locking seat <b>21</b> to prevent the slider <b>62</b> from sliding along the guide <b>7</b> when the slider <b>62</b> is located at the top end portion <b>71</b> of the guide <b>7</b>. This will afford stable positioning of the movable bar <b>6</b> in the upper position even when the constraint element <b>9</b> is retained in the spaced-apart position.</p>
<p id="p-0060" num="0059">Also, the movable bar <b>6</b> has a release mechanism <b>64</b> operable to disengage the locking member <b>63</b> from the locking seat <b>21</b>, to thereby allow the slider <b>62</b> to slide again along the guide <b>7</b>. Only one release actuator of the release mechanism <b>64</b>, associated with the movable bar <b>6</b>, is shown.</p>
<p id="p-0061" num="0060">It shall be noted that the crib <b>100</b> preferably does not have any locking mechanism for retaining the movable bar <b>6</b> in the lower position, so that the movable bar <b>6</b> may be spontaneously returned to the upper position, by means of the return system <b>8</b>, when the constraint element <b>9</b> is released, and may be returned to the close position.</p>
<p id="p-0062" num="0061">In the preferred embodiment, the crib <b>100</b> comprises a second roller <b>10</b> for handling the fabric that forms the movable wall <b>113</b> of the enclosure <b>110</b>. More in detail, the second roller <b>10</b> is mounted to the lower structure <b>3</b>, below the bottom <b>111</b> of the enclosure <b>110</b>. The movable wall <b>113</b> connects the movable bar <b>6</b> to the second roller <b>10</b>, and the second roller <b>10</b> is biased to rewind the movable wall <b>113</b> with a second force.</p>
<p id="p-0063" num="0062">For this purpose, the guide <b>7</b> has a second lower channel <b>76</b> for access to the groove <b>73</b>, at the lower end portion <b>72</b> of the guide <b>7</b>. The side edges of the movable wall <b>113</b> are adapted to slide between the groove <b>73</b> and the second roller <b>10</b> via the second lower channel <b>76</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0064" num="0063">It should be noted that the action of the second roller <b>10</b> on the movable bar <b>6</b> is directed opposite to the action of the first roller <b>81</b>. In order to achieve the above discussed functions, the action of the first roller <b>81</b> shall prevail, i.e. the first force shall be greater than the second force. This will not hinder proper rewinding of the movable wall <b>113</b> when the movable bar moves to the lowered position.</p>
<p id="p-0065" num="0064">A skilled person may obviously envisage a number of equivalent changes to the above discussed variants, without departure from the scope defined by the appended claims.</p>
