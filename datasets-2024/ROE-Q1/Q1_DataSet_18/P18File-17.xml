<p id="p-0002" num="0001">This disclosure relates to a method for controlling an operation of a robot cleaner and the robot cleaner in which such an operation control method is implemented.</p>
<heading id="h-0002" level="1">BACKGROUND ART</heading>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">A vacuum cleaner is an equipment that performs cleaning by suctioning or wiping dusts or foreign substances in a cleaning area.</p>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">Such a vacuum cleaner may be classified into a manual vacuum cleaner in which a user directly moves the vacuum cleaner to perform cleaning, and an automatic vacuum cleaner that performs cleaning while travelling by itself</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">In general, a robot cleaner <b>100</b> is an equipment that automatically performs a predetermined operation while travelling in a predetermined area by itself without any manipulation by a user. The robot cleaner <b>100</b> detects an obstacle existing in the predetermined area and approaches or avoid the obstacle to perform cleaning. The robot cleaner <b>100</b> may include a robot cleaner that performs cleaning while travelling in a predetermined area.</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">The robot cleaner may be implemented in a sweep mode of sweeping a floor, which is a surface to be cleaned, a suction mode, or a wet mode of spraying water on the floor to clean the floor in a wet manner.</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">The robot cleaner moves in a designated area to remove foreign substances in a predetermined mode. When the robot cleaner performs cleaning while repeatedly moving in the same area, a larger amount of foreign substances may be removed from the area. However, this may increase the time it takes for the robot cleaner to clean the entire area to be cleaned. Therefore, the robot cleaner needs to be efficiently moved in a designated area to be cleaned.</p>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">The robot cleaner needs to travel while repeatedly performing an operation of cleaning a cleaning area to improve a degree to which objects to be cleaned are removed. Therefore, the robot cleaner needs to efficiently travel in the cleaning area while repeatedly performing the operation of cleaning the cleaning area.</p>

Thus, the rotary plate has a pressing point in contact with the ground so that the robot cleaner <b>100</b> may travel with the rotation of the rotary plate. In an example embodiment, the robot cleaner <b>100</b> may perform cleaning while travelling with the rotation of the pad of the pad assemblies.</p>
<p id="p-0051" num="0050">In an example embodiment, with the operation of the wheels and/or the pad assemblies driven by the plurality of motors included in the drive part <b>110</b>, the robot cleaner <b>100</b> may travel in various modes, such as moving linearly forward or backward, travelling while rotating along an arc trajectory, rotating in place and the like. That is, the robot cleaner <b>100</b> may move linearly or rotate according to a difference in speed between the wheels and/or pad assemblies driven by each of the plurality of motors.</p>

The Lidar may detect, using a laser light, an object such as an obstacle based on a time-of-flight (TOF) of a transmission signal and a reception signal or a phase difference between the transmission signal and the reception signal.</p>
<p id="p-0055" num="0054">In an example embodiment, the Lidar may detect a distance between the robot cleaner <b>100</b> and an object, a relative speed between the robot cleaner <b>100</b> and the object, and a position of the object.</p>
<p id="p-0056" num="0055">In an example embodiment, the Lidar may be provided as a portion of constituent elements of an obstacle detection sensor. Further, the Lidar may be provided as a sensor for creating a map.</p>
<p id="p-0057" num="0056">Further, the obstacle detection sensor may detect an object, specifically an obstacle, which exist in a travel (movement) direction of a moving robot, and transmit information about the obstacle to the controller <b>130</b>. In this case, the controller <b>130</b> may control the motion of the robot cleaner <b>100</b> according to the position of the detected obstacle.</p>
<p id="p-0058" num="0057">In an example embodiment, the sensor <b>120</b> may use a gyro sensor, a wheel sensor, an acceleration sensor, or the like.</p>
<p id="p-0059" num="0058">When the robot cleaner <b>100</b> moves in an operation mode, the gyro sensor detects a rotational direction of the robot cleaner <b>100</b> and detects a rotational angle. The gyro sensor detects an angular velocity of the robot cleaner <b>100</b> and outputs a voltage value corresponding to the angular velocity. The controller <b>130</b> calculates the rotational direction and the rotational angle using the voltage value output from the gyro sensor.</p>
<p id="p-0060" num="0059">In an example embodiment, a movement distance sensor included in the sensor <b>120</b> senses a change in position according to the movement of the robot cleaner <b>100</b>, senses a position of the robot cleaner <b>100</b>, for example, a movement distance displaced from an initial position, and detects an actual position information of the robot cleaner <b>100</b>. In an example embodiment, the movement distance sensor may include an encoder that detects the number of rotations of a plurality of motors included in the drive part <b>110</b> in order to sense the movement distance of the robot cleaner <b>100</b>. In an example embodiment, the movement distance sensor may sense the number of rotations of the wheels and/or the pad assemblies included in the drive part <b>110</b>. In an example embodiment, the movement distance sensor, which may be a rotary encoder, may detect the number of rotations and output the same to the controller <b>130</b>. In an example embodiment, the controller <b>130</b> may calculate a rotational speed of the wheels using the number of rotations. Further, the controller <b>130</b> may calculate the rotational angle using a difference in the number of rotations.</p>
<p id="p-0061" num="0060">The acceleration sensor detects a speed change of the robot cleaner <b>100</b>, for example, a change of the robot cleaner <b>100</b> according to start, stop, direction change, collision with an object, or the like. The acceleration sensor may be attached to a position adjacent to a main wheel or an auxiliary wheel to detect slippage or idling state of the respective wheel.</p>
<p id="p-0062" num="0061">Further, the acceleration sensor may sense the speed change of the robot cleaner <b>100</b>. That is, the acceleration sensor detects an impact level according to the speed change and outputs a voltage value corresponding to the impact level. Accordingly, the acceleration sensor may function as an electronic bumper.</p>
<p id="p-0063" num="0062">In an example embodiment, the sensor <b>120</b> includes at least one of a gyroscope configured to obtain acceleration information of the robot cleaner <b>100</b>, the movement distance sensor configured to obtain information about the movement distance of the robot cleaner <b>100</b>, and an obstacle sensor configured to detect an obstacle in a cleaning area.</p>
<p id="p-0064" num="0063">In an example embodiment, the sensor <b>120</b> may be disposed at the robot cleaner <b>100</b> toward one side.</p>
<p id="p-0065" num="0064">In an example embodiment, the sensor <b>120</b> is disposed on a front side of the robot cleaner <b>100</b> to sense an obstacle, terrain or the like in front so that a leading end of the robot cleaner <b>100</b> does not collide with the obstacle or the like.</p>
<p id="p-0066" num="0065">In an example embodiment, the sensor <b>120</b> may be configured to further perform other sensing functions in addition to such sensing functions.</p>
<p id="p-0067" num="0066">For example, the sensor <b>120</b> may include a camera configured to capture an image of surroundings. The camera may include a lens and an image sensor. Further, the camera converts an image around the robot cleaner <b>100</b> into an electrical signal that may be processed by the controller <b>130</b>. For example, the camera may transmit an electrical signal corresponding to an upper image to the controller <b>130</b>. The electrical signal corresponding to the upper image may be used when the controller <b>130</b> detects the position of the robot cleaner <b>100</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0068" num="0067">Further, the sensor <b>120</b> may detect obstacles such as a wall, furniture, cliff or the like on a travel plane or travel path of the robot cleaner <b>100</b>. Further, the sensor <b>120</b> may detect the presence of a docking device that charges a battery. Further, the sensor <b>120</b> may sense ceiling information and may map a travel area or a cleaning area of the robot cleaner <b>100</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0069" num="0068">Further, the sensor <b>120</b> may include at least one of an external signal detection sensor, a front detection sensor, a cliff detection sensor, a two-dimensional (2D) camera sensor, and a three-dimensional (3D) camera sensor.</p>
<p id="p-0070" num="0069">The external signal detection sensor may detect a signal outside the robot cleaner <b>100</b>. As an example, the external signal detection sensor may be an infrared ray sensor, an ultrasonic sensor, a radio frequency (RF) sensor, or the like.</p>
<p id="p-0071" num="0070">The robot cleaner <b>100</b> may receive a guide signal generated from a charging station using the external signal detection sensor to confirm a position and direction of the charging station. In this case, the charging station may transmit a guide signal indicating a direction and a distance so that the robot cleaner <b>100</b> is able to come back. That is, the robot cleaner <b>100</b> may receive the signal generated from the charging station, determine a current position of the robot cleaner <b>100</b>, set a movement direction thereof, and return to the charging station.</p>
<p id="p-0072" num="0071">Further, the front detection sensor may be installed at regular intervals in front of the robot cleaner <b>100</b>, specifically, along an outer peripheral surface of a lateral surface of the robot cleaner <b>100</b>. The front detection sensor may be located on at least one lateral side of the robot cleaner <b>100</b> to detect an obstacle in the front. The front detection sensor may transmit, to the controller <b>130</b>, information obtained by detecting an object, specifically the obstacle, existing in the movement direction of the robot cleaner <b>100</b>. That is, the front detection sensor may detect protrusions, household appliances, furniture, wall surfaces, wall corners, or the like, which exist on a movement path of the robot cleaner <b>100</b>, and transmit information relating thereto to the controller <b>130</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0073" num="0072">As an example, the front detection sensor may be an infrared ray sensor, an ultrasonic sensor, an RF sensor, a geomagnetic sensor, or the like. The robot cleaner <b>100</b> uses one type of sensor or two or more types of sensors among various types of front detection sensors described above as needed.</p>
<p id="p-0074" num="0073">For example, in general, the ultrasonic sensor may be mainly used to detect a long-distance obstacle. The ultrasonic sensor includes a transmitter and a receiver. The controller <b>130</b> may determine the presence or absence of an obstacle according to whether or not an ultrasonic wave radiated from the transmitter is reflected at the obstacle and is received by the receiver, and calculate a distance from the obstacle using an ultrasonic wave radiation time and an ultrasonic wave reception time.</p>
<p id="p-0075" num="0074">Further, the controller <b>130</b> may detect information relating to a size of the obstacle by comparing the ultrasonic wave radiated from the transmitter with the ultrasonic wave received by the receiver. For example, the controller <b>130</b> may determine that the size of the obstacle increases as a larger amount of ultrasonic waves are received by the receiver.</p>
<p id="p-0076" num="0075">In an example embodiment, a plurality (for example, five) of ultrasonic sensors may be installed on the front lateral side of the robot cleaner <b>100</b> along the outer circumferential surface thereof. In this case, the ultrasonic sensors may be installed in the front of the robot cleaner <b>100</b> in a state in which transmitters and receivers are alternately arranged.</p>
<p id="p-0077" num="0076">That is, the transmitters may be arranged to be spaced apart from the center of the front of a main body to left and right sides. One or more transmitters may be arranged between the receivers to form a reception area in which the ultrasonic signal reflected from the obstacle or the like is received. With such an arrangement, the reception area may be expanded with a reduced number of sensors. A transmission angle of the ultrasonic wave may be maintained within a range that does not affect different signals to prevent a crosstalk phenomenon. Further, reception sensitivities of the receivers may be set differently.</p>
<p id="p-0078" num="0077">Further, the ultrasonic sensor may be installed upward by a certain angle so that the ultrasonic wave transmitted from the ultrasonic sensor are output upward. In this case, the ultrasonic sensor may further include a blocking member to prevent the ultrasonic wave from being radiated downward.</p>
<p id="p-0079" num="0078">Further, as described above, the front detection sensor may use two or more types of sensors together. Thus, the front detection sensor may use one of the infrared ray sensor, the ultrasonic sensor, and the RF sensor.</p>
<p id="p-0080" num="0079">As an example, the front detection sensor may include the infrared ray sensor in addition to the ultrasonic sensor.</p>
<p id="p-0081" num="0080">The infrared ray sensor may be installed on the outer peripheral surface of the robot cleaner <b>100</b> together with the ultrasonic sensor. The infrared ray sensor may also detect an obstacle existing in the front or on the lateral side of the robot cleaner <b>100</b> and transmit information about the obstacle to the controller <b>130</b>. That is, the infrared ray sensor detects protrusions, household appliances, furniture, wall surfaces, wall corners, or the like existing on the movement path of the robot cleaner <b>100</b> and transmits information relating thereto the controller <b>130</b>. Accordingly, the robot cleaner <b>100</b> may move within a specific area in a state in which the main body does not collide with the obstacle.</p>
<p id="p-0082" num="0081">Further, the cliff detection sensor may mainly use various types of optical sensors to detect an obstacle on the floor that supports the main body of the robot cleaner <b>100</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0083" num="0082">That is, the cliff detection sensor is installed on the rear side of the robot cleaner <b>100</b> at the side of the floor, but may be installed at another position depending on the type of the robot cleaner <b>100</b>. The cliff detection sensor is located on the rear surface of the robot cleaner <b>100</b> to detect an obstacle on the floor. The cliff detection sensor may include an infrared ray sensor, an ultrasonic sensor, an RF sensor, a position sensitive detector (PSD) sensor and the like, each of which includes a light emitting part and a light receiving part, like the obstacle detection sensor.</p>
<p id="p-0084" num="0083">For example, one of such cliff detection sensors may be installed in front of the robot cleaner <b>100</b>, and the other two cliff detection sensors may be installed relatively beyond the cliff detection sensor.</p>
<p id="p-0085" num="0084">For example, the cliff detection sensor may be the PSD sensor, and may also include a plurality of different types of sensors.</p>
<p id="p-0086" num="0085">The PSD sensor detects a short and long distance position of an incident light with a single p-n junction using a semiconductor surface resistance. The PSD sensor may include a one-dimensional PSD sensor that detects light in merely one axial direction and a two-dimensional PSD sensor that detects a position of light on a plane, which may have a pin photodiode structure. The PSD sensor is a type of infrared ray sensor, and measures a distance to an obstacle by transmitting infrared rays and measuring an angle of infrared rays reflected from the obstacle. That is, the PSD sensor calculates the distance to the obstacle using a triangulation method.</p>
<p id="p-0087" num="0086">The PSD sensor includes a light emitting part that emits an infrared ray to an obstacle and a light receiving part that receives the infrared ray reflected from the obstacle, and may be generally configured in a module form. When the obstacle is detected using the PSD sensor, a stable measurement value may be obtained regardless of a difference in reflectance and a difference in color of the obstacle.</p>
<p id="p-0088" num="0087">Further, the controller <b>130</b> may detect a cliff and analyze a depth thereof by measuring an infrared ray angle between a light emitting signal of the infrared ray emitted from the cliff detection sensor toward the ground and a reflection signal received by being reflected from the obstacle.</p>
<p id="p-0089" num="0088">Further, the controller <b>130</b> may check a ground state of the cliff detected by the cliff detection sensor, and may determine whether or not the robot cleaner <b>100</b> may pass through the cliff according to the ground state. For example, the controller <b>130</b> may determine the presence or absence of a cliff and a depth of the cliff using the cliff detection sensor, and then control the robot cleaner <b>100</b> to pass through the cliff merely when the cliff detection sensor detects the reflection signal from the cliff.</p>
<p id="p-0090" num="0089">As another example, the controller <b>130</b> may determine a lift-up state of the robot cleaner <b>100</b> using the cliff detection sensor.</p>
<p id="p-0091" num="0090">Further, the two-dimensional camera sensor may be provided on one surface of the robot cleaner <b>100</b> to obtain image information relating to the surrounding of the main body during movement.</p>
<p id="p-0092" num="0091">The optical flow sensor may convert a lower image input from an image sensor provided inside the sensor to generate image data of a predetermined format. The generated image data may be stored in a memory (not illustrated).</p>
<p id="p-0093" num="0092">Further, one or more light sources may be installed adjacent to the optical flow sensor. One or more light sources irradiate light to a predetermined area of the floor surface captured by the image sensor. That is, in a case in which the robot cleaner <b>100</b> moves in a specific area along a floor surface, when the floor surface is flat, a certain distance is maintained between the image sensor and the floor surface. On the other hand, in a case in which the robot cleaner <b>100</b> moves on a floor surface whose surface state is ununiform, the image sensor and the floor surface may be spaced apart from each other by a certain distance or more due to irregularities and obstacles on the floor surface. In this case, the one or more light sources may be controlled by the controller <b>130</b> to adjust the amount of light irradiated. The light source may be a light emitting element capable of controlling an amount of light therefrom, for example, a light emitting diode (LED).</p>
<p id="p-0094" num="0093">By using the optical flow sensor, the controller <b>130</b> may detect a position of the robot cleaner <b>100</b> irrespective of the sliding of the robot cleaner <b>100</b>. The controller <b>130</b> may calculate a movement distance and a movement direction by comparing and analyzing pieces of data about the image captured by the optical flow sensor over time, and may calculate the position of the robot cleaner <b>100</b> based on the calculated distance and direction. By using information about a lower image of the robot cleaner <b>100</b> obtained by the optical flow sensor, the controller <b>130</b> may perform a strong correction against slipping with respect to a position of the robot cleaner <b>100</b> calculated by another part.</p>
<p id="p-0095" num="0094">The three-dimensional camera sensor may be attached to one surface or a portion of the main body of the robot cleaner <b>100</b> to generate three-dimensional coordinate information relating to the surrounding of the main body.</p>
<p id="p-0096" num="0095">That is, the three-dimensional camera sensor may be a three-dimensional depth camera (3D Depth Camera) that calculates a near distance between the robot cleaner <b>100</b> and an object to be captured.</p>
<p id="p-0097" num="0096">Specifically, the three-dimensional camera sensor may capture a two-dimensional image relating to the surrounding of the main body, and may generate plural pieces of three-dimensional coordinate information corresponding to the captured two-dimensional image.</p>
<p id="p-0098" num="0097">In an example embodiment, the three-dimensional camera sensor may be implemented in a stereo vision mode in which two or more cameras for capturing a two-dimensional image in the art, and two or more images obtained by the two or more cameras are combined with each other to generate three-dimensional coordinate information.</p>
<p id="p-0099" num="0098">Specifically, the three-dimensional camera sensor according to an example embodiment may include a first pattern irradiation part that irradiates a first pattern of light downward toward the front of the main body, a second pattern irradiation part that irradiates a second pattern of light upward toward the front of the main body, and an image acquisition part that acquires an image of the front of the main body. Accordingly, the image acquisition part may acquire an image of a region to which the first pattern of light and the second pattern of light are incident.</p>
<p id="p-0100" num="0099">In another example embodiment, the three-dimensional camera sensor includes an infrared ray pattern irradiation part that irradiates an infrared ray pattern in addition to a single camera. The three-dimensional camera sensor may capture an image of a shape of the infrared ray pattern irradiated from the infrared ray pattern irradiation part projected on the object to be captured, to measure a distance between the three-dimensional camera sensor and the object to be captured. The three-dimensional camera sensor may be an infra-red (IR) type of three-dimensional camera sensor.</p>
<p id="p-0101" num="0100">In another example embodiment, the three-dimensional camera sensor may include a light emitting part that emits light together with a single camera, receive a portion of laser beams radiated from the light emitting part and reflected from the object to be captured, and analyze the received laser beams to measure a distance between the camera sensor and the object to be captured. The three-dimensional camera sensor may be a three-dimensional camera sensor using the time-of-flight (TOF) mode.</p>
<p id="p-0102" num="0101">Specifically, the three-dimensional camera sensor as described above is configured to irradiate laser beams to extend in at least one direction. As an example, the three-dimensional camera sensor may include a first laser and a second laser. The first laser may irradiate linear laser beams that intersects with each other, and the second laser may irradiate a single linear laser beam.

<p id="p-0180" num="0179">In an example embodiment, the robot cleaner <b>900</b> may move by a predetermined distance <b>930</b> along the first reference trajectory RL<b>1</b> in the linear travel mode (reference numeral <b>940</b>).</p>
<p id="p-0181" num="0180">In an example embodiment, assuming that a starting time of the travel cycle is a time point at which the robot cleaner <b>900</b> moves from the first reference trajectory RL<b>1</b> to the second reference trajectory RL<b>2</b> (reference numeral <b>902</b>), the controller <b>130</b> may determine that the travel cycle of the robot cleaner <b>900</b> ends when the robot cleaner <b>900</b> has moved the predetermined distance <b>930</b> along the first reference trajectory RL<b>1</b> (reference numeral <b>940</b>). That is, the controller <b>130</b> may control the drive part <b>110</b> so that the robot cleaner <b>900</b> moves forward in a predetermined direction by repeating the travel cycle in which the robot cleaner <b>900</b> starts to move from the first reference trajectory RL<b>1</b> to the second reference trajectory RL<b>2</b> (reference numeral <b>902</b>) and moves by the predetermined distance <b>930</b> (reference numeral <b>940</b>). In an example embodiment, a position of the robot cleaner <b>900</b> on the first reference trajectory RL<b>1</b> at the end of the travel cycle may be a position displaced by a predetermined distance <b>970</b> compared to the position <b>905</b> at the start of the travel cycle. In an example embodiment, the controller <b>130</b> may control the drive part <b>110</b> to repeatedly perform the travel cycle so that the robot cleaner <b>900</b> performs cleaning while moving forward in a predetermined direction.</p>
<p id="p-0182" num="0181">In an example embodiment, the robot cleaner <b>100</b> may perform cleaning through various functions such as an autonomous driving function that travels by itself rather than moving by an external force by a user. In an example embodiment, the controller <b>130</b> may create a map through various algorithms in the art, such as a dead reckoning, a simultaneous localization and map-building (SLAM) and the like based on various pieces of information obtained by the sensor <b>120</b> and use the map for traveling. In an example embodiment, the robot cleaner <b>100</b> may further include a separate sensor or processor for executing such algorithms.</p>
<p id="p-0183" num="0182">In an example embodiment, the robot cleaner <b>100</b> may further include a computer-readable recording medium or memory (not illustrated) that records programs for executing the various modes described above. A power line communication method of the robot cleaner <b>100</b> according to the present disclosure described above may be provided by being recorded in the computer-readable recording medium that records a program to be executed by a computer.</p>
<p id="p-0184" num="0183">The methods of the present disclosure may be executed through software. When executed through the software, the constituent means of the present disclosure are code segments that perform necessary tasks. The program or code segments may be stored on a processor-readable medium.</p>
<p id="p-0185" num="0184">The computer-readable recording medium may include all types of recording mediums in which data readable by a computer system is stored. Examples of the computer-readable recording medium may include a read-only memory (ROM), a random access memory (RAM), a compact disk-read only memory (CD-ROM), a digital versatile disk (DVD)&#xb1;ROM, a magnetic tape, a floppy disk, a hard disk, an optical data storing device, and the like. Further, the computer-readable recording medium may be distributed over network coupled computer systems, and thus, the computer-readable code may be stored and executed in a distributed fashion.</p>

It is not limited by the drawings. Further, example embodiments described in the present disclosure are not limitedly applicable, but all or part of each example embodiment may be selectively combined so that various modifications may be made.</p>
