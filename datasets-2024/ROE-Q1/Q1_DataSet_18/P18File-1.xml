<heading id="h-0002" level="1">BACKGROUND</heading>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">Outdoor moving devices are used for working outdoors, such as a utility vehicle, an agricultural machinery vehicle, a farmer's vehicle, a dune buggy, a golf cart, and a riding mower. When working outdoors, these devices need to carry some energy storage devices. The energy storage devices of the outdoor moving devices may be basically divided into two types: energy storage devices using gasoline, diesel, and other fuels, and electrical energy storage devices. The electrical energy storage devices are more environmentally friendly and save more energy than the fuels and thus are more attractive to users and manufacturers in recent years.</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">However, the electrical energy storage device of an outdoor moving device generally uses a built-in and fixedly mounted stationary battery as an energy storage device. Such energy storage device limits the maximum energy storage capacity of the outdoor moving device. Especially for a professional user, the outdoor moving device has too single a function to satisfy the requirements of the professional user for working outdoors for a relatively long time and for various working contents.</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">For example, as a garden tool, the riding mower is widely applied to the fields including lawn and vegetation trimming. The professional user needs to trim lawns, branches, and weeds near shrubs and blow fallen leaves during working. The energy storage device carried by the riding mower cannot satisfy the electrical energy and operation requirements of the user who deals with too many affairs. However, if the riding mower is only provided with some detachable batteries that are relatively large in volume and relatively high in cost, the stored energy cannot satisfy the requirement of a large outdoor moving device working outdoors for a relatively long time.</p>

<heading id="h-0005" level="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION</heading>
<p id="p-0218" num="0217">The present application is described below in detail in conjunction with drawings and examples.</p>
<p id="p-0219" num="0218">It is to be understood by those skilled in the art that in the description of the present application, orientations or position relations indicated by terms such as &#x201c;up&#x201d;, &#x201c;down&#x201d;, &#x201c;front&#x201d;, &#x201c;rear&#x201d;, &#x201c;left&#x201d;, and &#x201c;right&#x201d; are based on the drawings. These orientations or position relations are intended only to facilitate and simplify the description of the present application and not to indicate or imply that a device or element referred to must have such particular orientations or must be configured or operated in such particular orientations. Thus, the terms are not to be construed as limiting the present application.</p>
<p id="p-0220" num="0219">The present application is described below in detail in conjunction with drawings and examples.</p>
<p id="p-0221" num="0220">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>, the present application provides an outdoor tool device and, in particular, an outdoor moving device <b>100</b>. The outdoor moving device <b>100</b> is specifically a riding mower capable of moving and mowing outdoors. It is to be understood that the outdoor moving device may be another vehicle that only moves outdoors, such as a utility vehicle shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>20</b></figref>, or may be a dune buggy, a farmer's vehicle, a golf cart, or the like. The outdoor moving device may also be a vehicle which, like the riding mower shown in this example, can implement another function in addition to a moving function, such as a snow thrower shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>19</b></figref>. The snow thrower can move outdoors and implement a snow throwing function. The outdoor moving device may also be an agricultural machinery vehicle, such as a harvester and a pesticide spraying vehicle. It is to be understood that the outdoor tool device may also be a washer shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>21</b></figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0222" num="0221">In fact, any outdoor moving device that adopts the essence of the technical solutions of the present application described below belongs to the protection scope of the present application.</p>
<p id="p-0223" num="0222">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>1</b> to <b>3</b></figref>, the outdoor moving device <b>100</b> includes a main body <b>100</b><i>a </i>and a moving wheel set <b>120</b>. The main body <b>100</b><i>a </i>further includes a housing <b>110</b> and a moving electric motor <b>130</b>. The moving wheel set <b>120</b> is connected to the main body <b>100</b><i>a </i>to support the main body <b>100</b><i>a</i>. The moving wheel set <b>120</b> can drive the outdoor moving device <b>100</b> to move at least along a front and rear direction. The moving wheel assembly <b>120</b> includes rear moving wheels <b>131</b> and front moving wheels <b>132</b>. The moving electric motor <b>130</b> drives the rear moving wheels <b>131</b> or the front moving wheels <b>132</b> to rotate so that the outdoor moving device <b>100</b> can move on the ground. Two moving electric motors <b>130</b> may be provided, and the two moving electric motors <b>130</b> separately drive two rear moving wheels <b>131</b> so that the outdoor moving device <b>100</b> can turn in other directions deviating from the front and rear direction.</p>
<p id="p-0224" num="0223">The outdoor moving device <b>100</b> further includes a functional assembly <b>140</b> for implementing a tool function and a drive electric motor <b>141</b> for driving the functional assembly <b>140</b>. In this example, the outdoor moving device <b>100</b> is the riding mower, the functional assembly <b>140</b> is specifically a mowing assembly including a mowing element for mowing lawns, and the drive electric motor <b>141</b> drives the mowing element to rotate.</p>
<p id="p-0225" num="0224">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>, the outdoor moving device <b>100</b> can be used for a user to ride on. The user may control the outdoor moving device <b>100</b> to move and operate the outdoor moving device <b>100</b> to trim lawns and vegetation at the same time. The outdoor moving device <b>100</b> further includes a seat <b>111</b> on which the user sits. The seat <b>111</b> is mounted to the housing <b>110</b> and used for the user to sit on. In this example, the riding mower includes an operating assembly, where the operating assembly is specifically an operating rod assembly <b>112</b> that is operable by the user to control the riding mower to move forwards, move backwards, and turn.</p>
<p id="p-0226" num="0225">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref>, the outdoor moving device <b>100</b> further includes a first energy storage device <b>150</b> and a second energy storage device <b>160</b>, where both the first energy storage device <b>150</b> and the second energy storage device <b>160</b> can supply power to the outdoor moving device <b>100</b>. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>2</b> to <b>6</b></figref>, the first energy storage device <b>150</b> includes at least one first energy storage unit <b>151</b>. The second energy storage device <b>160</b> includes at least one second energy storage unit <b>161</b>. The first energy storage device <b>150</b> is connected to the housing <b>110</b> in a first mounting manner so that the first energy storage device <b>150</b> is detachably mounted to the housing <b>110</b> in the first mounting manner. For example, in this example, the first energy storage device <b>150</b> includes a battery pack <b>152</b> that is detachably mounted to the housing <b>110</b>. The second energy storage device <b>160</b> is connected to the housing <b>110</b> in a second mounting manner different from the first mounting manner. The second mounting manner differs from the first mounting manner in that the first energy storage device <b>150</b> is detachably mounted to the housing <b>110</b> in the first mounting manner. Specifically, the battery pack <b>152</b> is pluggably mounted to the housing <b>110</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0227" num="0226">The battery pack <b>152</b> includes a battery pack housing <b>152</b><i>a </i>and the first energy storage unit <b>151</b> disposed on the battery pack housing <b>152</b><i>a</i>, where the first energy storage unit <b>151</b> may be specifically a cylindrical cell unit. The battery pack housing <b>152</b><i>a </i>is provided with a battery pack interface <b>152</b><i>b </i>through which the battery pack <b>152</b> is pluggably mounted to the housing <b>110</b>, and the housing <b>110</b> is formed with a main body interface <b>110</b><i>a </i>corresponding to the battery pack interface <b>152</b><i>b</i>. The battery pack interface <b>152</b><i>b </i>mates with the main body interface <b>110</b><i>a </i>so that the battery pack <b>152</b> can be mechanically connected and electrically connected to the main body <b>100</b><i>a</i>. Further, a slide rail <b>152</b><i>c </i>is disposed at the battery pack interface <b>152</b><i>b</i>, where the slide rail <b>152</b><i>c </i>guides the battery pack <b>152</b> to be slidably mounted to the housing <b>110</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0228" num="0227">The second energy storage device <b>160</b> is connected to the housing <b>110</b> in the second mounting manner different from the first mounting manner, the first energy storage device <b>150</b> is detachably mounted to the housing, and the second energy storage device <b>160</b> may be connected to the housing in a fixed mounting manner different from the detachable mounting manner. It is to be noted that the second mounting manner does not limit that the second energy storage device <b>160</b> cannot be detachably mounted to the housing <b>110</b>. Specifically, both the first energy storage device <b>150</b> and the second energy storage device <b>160</b> may be detachably mounted to the housing <b>110</b>, but the first energy storage device <b>150</b> is pluggably mounted to the housing <b>110</b> and the second energy storage device <b>160</b> is mounted to the housing <b>110</b> in another detachable connection manner different from the pluggable connection manner. For example, the second energy storage device <b>160</b> is detachably mounted to the housing <b>110</b> in a snap connection manner. In this case, it may be considered that the pluggable connection manner of the first energy storage device <b>150</b> is different from the snap connection manner of the second energy storage device <b>160</b>, that is to say, the first mounting manner of the first energy storage device <b>150</b> is different from the second mounting manner of the second energy storage device <b>160</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0229" num="0228">In this example, the second energy storage device <b>160</b> is fixedly mounted to the housing <b>110</b> in the second mounting manner. The second energy storage device <b>160</b> is configured to be fixedly mounted to the housing <b>110</b>, where the fixed connection manner includes, but is not limited to, welding, screwing, snapping, or a non-movable connection. When the second energy storage device <b>160</b> is fixedly mounted to the housing <b>110</b>, the second energy storage device <b>160</b> may not be detachable or may be detached from the housing <b>110</b> by the user by means of an external tool, thereby facilitating the maintenance of the second energy storage device <b>160</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0230" num="0229">The outdoor moving device <b>100</b> further includes a connection assembly through which the second energy storage device <b>160</b> is fixedly connected to housing <b>110</b>, where the connection assembly may include a fastening element such as a screw. The second energy storage device <b>160</b> is specially adapted to the outdoor moving device <b>100</b>. For some relatively large outdoor moving devices <b>100</b>, the outdoor moving device <b>100</b> needs to work outdoors for a relatively long time, the outdoor moving device <b>100</b> consumes a relatively large amount of energy per unit time, and the second energy storage device <b>160</b> may store a relatively large amount of energy to supply power to the outdoor moving device <b>100</b>. The second energy storage device <b>160</b> is fixedly mounted to the housing and has a shape better adapted to the outdoor moving device <b>100</b> so that the shape and structure of the second energy storage device <b>160</b> are more compact, a space occupation rate of the second energy storage unit <b>161</b> in the second energy storage device <b>160</b> may be set to be higher, and thus the second energy storage device <b>160</b> can have a relatively large amount of energy. The first energy storage device <b>150</b> includes the battery pack <b>152</b> detachably mounted to the housing <b>110</b>, where the battery pack <b>152</b> may be configured to be adaptable to a power tool different from the outdoor moving device <b>100</b>. For example, the power tool may be a blower <b>200</b><i>a </i>in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>8</b></figref>. The outdoor moving device <b>100</b> further includes the first energy storage device <b>150</b> in addition to the second energy storage device <b>160</b>, where the first energy storage device <b>150</b> may extend a working duration of the outdoor moving device <b>100</b> and can be adapted to other power tools so that in the case where the first energy storage device <b>150</b> of the outdoor moving device <b>100</b> temporarily has insufficient power, a power supply device of another power tool may supply power to the outdoor moving device <b>100</b>. At the same time, the first energy storage device <b>150</b> is configured to be detachably mounted to the housing <b>110</b>. In this manner, when the user needs to perform diverse tasks outdoors, in addition to the outdoor moving device <b>100</b>, the user also needs to use other power tools to work. For example, the user uses the blower <b>200</b><i>a </i>to blow trimmed weeds or fallen leaves. At this time, the first energy storage device on the outdoor moving device <b>100</b> may supply power to the blower <b>200</b><i>a</i>, thereby improving the working flexibility of the outdoor moving device, facilitating a variety of outdoor tasks handled by the professional garden staff, extending an outdoor working duration, and improving working efficiency.</p>
<p id="p-0231" num="0230">The battery pack <b>152</b> in the present application may be applied not only to the outdoor moving device <b>100</b> but also to other power tools, thereby improving the adaptability of the battery pack <b>152</b> and improving the ability of the outdoor moving device <b>100</b> to adapt to the battery pack <b>152</b> of another power tool. In this manner, when the outdoor moving device <b>100</b> is not in use, the user can detach the battery pack <b>152</b> for use with other power tools, thereby avoiding the waste of resources and reducing the cost of use. Alternatively, when the user needs to use the outdoor moving device <b>100</b>, the user may use the battery pack <b>152</b> in another power tool as an energy source. The battery pack <b>152</b> includes multiple cell units connected in series, or multiple cell units connected in parallel, or multiple cell units connected in series and in parallel. Multiple cell units are integrated in the battery pack housing <b>152</b><i>a </i>so as to form a whole, where the cell units may specifically be lithium cell units.

<p id="p-0238" num="0237">An energy density of the first energy storage unit <b>151</b> is different from an energy density of the second energy storage unit <b>161</b>. For the first energy storage device <b>150</b> and the second energy storage device <b>160</b> with different mounting manners, the first energy storage unit <b>151</b> and the second energy storage unit <b>161</b> with different energy densities are selected to separately adapt to the characteristics of the fixed connection manner and the detachable mounting and connection manner, thereby achieving the purposes of reducing the cost and improving the lifetime. In this example, the energy density of the first energy storage unit <b>151</b> is greater than the energy density of the second energy storage unit <b>161</b> so that the cost of the second energy storage device <b>160</b> with the larger total energy and the larger volume can be better considered. Optionally, a ratio of the energy density of the second energy storage unit <b>161</b> to the energy density of the first energy storage unit <b>151</b> is greater than or equal to 0.3 and less than or equal to 1. Alternatively, the ratio of the energy density of the second energy storage unit <b>161</b> to the energy density of the first energy storage unit <b>151</b> is greater than or equal to 0.8 and less than or equal to 1. Alternatively, the ratio of the energy density of the second energy storage unit <b>161</b> to the energy density of the first energy storage unit <b>151</b> is greater than or equal to 0.8 and less than or equal to 1.2.

<p id="p-0239" num="0238">The first positive electrode <b>151</b><i>a </i>of the first energy storage unit <b>151</b> is made of a first material, and the second positive electrode <b>161</b><i>a </i>of the second energy storage unit <b>161</b> is made of a second material. The second material is different from the first material, and the first energy storage device <b>150</b> and the second energy storage device <b>160</b> of different types may supply power to the outdoor moving device <b>100</b> so that power supply platforms of other power tools on the market can be better considered, the cost of the outdoor moving device <b>100</b> can be reduced, and the total energy of the first energy storage device <b>150</b> can be increased. For example, in this example, the second positive electrode <b>161</b><i>a </i>of the second energy storage unit <b>161</b> is made of lithium iron phosphate, and the first positive electrode <b>151</b><i>a </i>of the first energy storage unit <b>151</b> is made of a material containing lithium.

<p id="p-0240" num="0239">In other examples, the second energy storage unit <b>161</b> may be a supercapacitor, which is also known as an electrochemical capacitor. Specifically, the second energy storage unit <b>161</b> is an asymmetric supercapacitor. An electrochemical capacitor based on the principle of bipolar plate capacitance is generally designed to be symmetric. Two identical materials with matched masses are used for a positive electrode and a negative electrode, such as an activated carbon electrode. The symmetric capacitor generally has no difference between the positive electrode and the negative electrode. Although a power density and a cycle life of the symmetric capacitor are excellent, an energy density of the symmetric capacitor is much lower than an energy density of a lithium-ion battery, a nickel metal hydride battery, or the like. However, two electrodes of the asymmetric capacitor use different materials, such as a carbon material/transition metal oxide system electrode material, a carbon material/conductive polymer system electrode material, or two activated carbon electrodes with different electrochemical properties, thereby improving the energy density of the electrochemical capacitor to 80 to 120 Wh/kg. In this manner, the electrochemical capacitor can be used as an energy supply unit of the power tool. For example, the second energy storage unit <b>161</b> may be a lithium-carbon capacitor (LCC).</p>
<p id="p-0241" num="0240">The first energy storage unit <b>151</b> and the second energy storage unit <b>161</b> use different materials so that the first energy storage device <b>150</b> and the second energy storage device <b>160</b> may have different service lives. In this manner, even when one of the first energy storage device <b>150</b> or the second energy storage device <b>160</b> is damaged, the other one can supply power to the outdoor moving device <b>100</b>. Further, since the first energy storage unit <b>151</b> and the second energy storage unit <b>161</b> are made of different materials, a temperature characteristic of the first energy storage device <b>150</b> is different from a temperature characteristic of the second energy storage device <b>160</b>. In this manner, when the outdoor moving device <b>100</b> works in a low-temperature environment, one of the first energy storage device <b>150</b> or the second energy storage device <b>160</b> which has a better low-temperature characteristic may be used for power supply. For example, in this example, the second energy storage unit <b>161</b> is a lithium iron phosphate cell, and the first energy storage unit <b>151</b> is a lithium cell. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>11</b> and <b>12</b></figref>, at &#x2212;20&#xb0; C., the second energy storage device <b>160</b> can release more power than the first energy storage device <b>150</b>. Therefore, when the outdoor moving device <b>100</b> is in a low-temperature working environment, the outdoor moving device <b>100</b> may be powered by the second energy storage device <b>160</b> as much as possible so that the working efficiency of the outdoor moving device <b>100</b> can be improved.</p>
<p id="p-0242" num="0241">The outdoor moving device <b>100</b> further includes an electrical connection assembly for electrically connecting the second energy storage device <b>160</b> to the moving electric motor <b>130</b> and a controller <b>175</b>, where the connection assembly and the electrical connection assembly are separated from each other. For the first energy storage device <b>150</b>, when the first energy storage device <b>150</b> is unplugged from the housing <b>110</b>, the first energy storage device <b>150</b> can be mechanically disconnected from the housing <b>110</b> and can basically be electrically disconnected from the housing <b>110</b> at the same time.

When the second energy storage device <b>160</b> is detached from the housing <b>110</b> through an auxiliary tool or multiple step operations, the second energy storage device <b>160</b> needs to be electrically and mechanically disconnected from the housing <b>110</b> in different operation manners separately.</p>

When the discharging unit <b>171</b> is in the first discharge mode, one of the first energy storage device <b>150</b> or the second energy storage device <b>160</b> supplies power to the outdoor moving device <b>100</b> and the other one of the first energy storage device <b>150</b> or the second energy storage device <b>160</b> does not supply power to the outdoor moving device <b>100</b>.

In this manner, the first energy storage device <b>150</b> and the second energy storage device <b>160</b> can discharge together to provide sufficient electrical energy for the outdoor moving device <b>100</b>. When the voltages of the first energy storage device <b>150</b> and the second energy storage device <b>160</b> are different, the discharging unit <b>171</b> is in the first discharge mode, and one of the first energy storage device <b>150</b> or the second energy storage device <b>160</b> which has a higher voltage discharges first.</p>
<p id="p-0246" num="0245">The first energy storage device <b>150</b> and the second energy storage device <b>160</b> can discharge together only when the voltages of the first energy storage device <b>150</b> and the second energy storage device <b>160</b> are equal or basically equal, that is, the first energy storage device <b>150</b> and the second energy storage device <b>160</b> can discharge together only when a voltage difference between the first energy storage device <b>150</b> and the second energy storage device <b>160</b> is within a preset range. In this example, that the voltages of the first energy storage device <b>150</b> and the second energy storage device <b>160</b> are equal means that the voltage difference between the first energy storage device <b>150</b> and the second energy storage device <b>160</b> is less than a preset voltage difference threshold, where the preset voltage difference threshold may be 2 V or 1 V. The first energy storage device <b>150</b> and the second energy storage device <b>160</b> discharge together so that it can be ensured that a current in a discharging loop of the first energy storage device <b>150</b> and the second energy storage device <b>160</b> does not exceed a safe current value that the first energy storage device <b>150</b> and the second energy storage device <b>160</b> can withstand. This has the advantage that too large an output current of the outdoor moving device <b>100</b> can be avoided. The first energy storage device <b>150</b> and the second energy storage device <b>160</b> need to have equal or basically equal voltages to be capable of discharging together, that is, the discharging unit <b>171</b> is in the second discharge mode. That is, when the voltage difference between the first energy storage device <b>150</b> and the second energy storage device <b>160</b> is within the preset range, the following case can be avoided: due to a relatively large voltage difference between the first energy storage device <b>150</b> and the second energy storage device <b>160</b>, the battery packs connected in parallel, when the first energy storage device <b>150</b> and the second energy storage device <b>160</b> discharge in parallel, the energy storage device with a high voltage charges the energy storage device with a low voltage, resulting in a reverse current flow, which is not conducive to the normal discharge of the first energy storage device <b>150</b> and the second energy storage device <b>160</b> and the normal operation of the outdoor moving device <b>100</b>.</p>

For example, the discharge of the first energy storage device <b>150</b> may be limited when the voltage of the first energy storage unit <b>151</b> is less than or equal to 2.5 V, and the discharge of the second energy storage device <b>160</b> may be limited when the voltage of the second energy storage unit <b>161</b> is less than or equal to 2.7 V.</p>
<p id="p-0303" num="0302">The controller <b>175</b> is configured to, when half of a discharge voltage of two first energy storage units <b>151</b> is less than or equal to the first voltage threshold, control the discharging unit <b>171</b> to limit the discharge of the first energy storage device <b>150</b> or when half of a discharge voltage of two second energy storage units <b>161</b> is less than or equal to the second voltage threshold, control the discharging unit <b>171</b> to limit the discharge of the second energy storage device <b>160</b>. Therefore, the effect on the discharge control performance of the inaccurate detection of the discharge voltage due to a relatively small voltage of a single energy storage unit can be avoided.</p>
<p id="p-0304" num="0303">In this example, the first voltage threshold or the second voltage threshold gradually decreases as the discharge current of the first energy storage device <b>150</b> or the discharge current of the second energy storage device <b>160</b> gradually increases. In other words, the undervoltage threshold when the first energy storage device <b>150</b> is discharged is inversely proportional to the magnitude of the discharge current of the device, and the undervoltage threshold when the second energy storage device <b>160</b> is discharged is inversely proportional to the magnitude of the discharge current of the device.</p>
<p id="p-0305" num="0304">In this example, the total energy of the second energy storage device <b>160</b> is greater than the total energy of the first energy storage device <b>150</b>. When the remaining power of the first energy storage device <b>150</b> is insufficient, the second energy storage device <b>160</b> may charge the first energy storage device so that the platformed first energy storage device <b>150</b> can satisfy more working requirements of the user. When the discharge current of the first energy storage device <b>150</b> is greater than a first current threshold, it may be considered that the first energy storage device <b>150</b> is likely to be overdischarged and the controller <b>175</b> may limit the power supply from the first energy storage device <b>150</b>. Specifically, the discharging loop of the first energy storage device <b>150</b> may be cut off or the discharge current of the first energy storage device <b>150</b> may be reduced. In this example, when the discharge current of the second energy storage device <b>160</b> is greater than a second current threshold in a discharging process, the controller <b>175</b> may control the discharging unit <b>171</b> to limit the discharge of the second energy storage device <b>160</b>, for example, to reduce the discharge current of the second energy storage device <b>160</b> or cut off a discharging loop. Particularly, the first current threshold is less than or equal to the second current threshold, that is, an overcurrent protection threshold of the second energy storage device <b>160</b> is greater than or equal to an overcurrent protection threshold of the first energy storage device <b>150</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0306" num="0305">In this example, the first positive electrode <b>151</b><i>a </i>of at least one first energy storage unit <b>151</b> included in the first energy storage device <b>150</b> is made of the first material, and the second positive electrode <b>161</b><i>a </i>of at least one second energy storage unit <b>161</b> included in the second energy storage device <b>160</b> is made of the second material. For example, the second positive electrode <b>161</b><i>a </i>is made of lithium iron phosphate, and the first positive electrode <b>151</b><i>a </i>is made of a material containing lithium. The first material and the second material may also be selected from nickel-cadmium batteries, graphene, and other materials, so as to achieve different combinations of battery characteristics.</p>
<p id="p-0307" num="0306">In this example, the controller <b>175</b> may determine, according to a Joule integral value of the discharge current of the energy storage device over a period of time, whether the energy storage device is likely to be overdischarged. The period of time is greater than or equal to 3 s and less than or equal to 120 s and may be, for example, 3 s, 5 s, 10 s, 20 s, 30 s, 40 s, 50 s, 60 s, 100 s, 120 s, or the like. For example, the controller <b>175</b> may compare a magnitude of the Joule integral value of the discharge current over 60 s with a current threshold to determine whether the corresponding energy storage device is overdischarged.</p>
<p id="p-0308" num="0307">When the energy storage device is overdischarged, the controller <b>175</b> may control the discharging unit <b>171</b> to limit the discharge of the corresponding energy storage device, for example, to cut off the discharging loop or reduce the discharge current. In an optional example, when the discharge current of the energy storage device is greater than the overcurrent protection threshold of the energy storage device, the controller <b>175</b> may limit the power of the moving electric motor or limit the power of the drive electric motor or limit the power of the two electric motors at the same time. Specifically, the power of the electric motor may be limited by limiting the rotational speed or output torque of the electric motor. The power of the electric motor is output power of the electric motor.</p>
<p id="p-0309" num="0308">In this example, the first material of the first positive electrode <b>151</b><i>a </i>of the first energy storage unit <b>151</b> is different from the second material of the second positive electrode <b>161</b><i>a </i>of the second energy storage unit <b>161</b>, and the two types of energy storage units are in different states when reaching their full voltages in the charging process. For example, the second positive electrode <b>161</b><i>a </i>of the second energy storage unit <b>161</b> is made of lithium iron phosphate, and when the second energy storage unit <b>161</b> is to be fully charged, a relatively large space for change still exists, that is, the full voltage of the second energy storage unit <b>161</b> may fluctuate within a certain voltage range. For example, when the voltage of the second energy storage unit <b>161</b> reaches 3.5 V, the second energy storage unit <b>161</b> may continue being charged to 3.6 V, 3.7 V, 3.8 V 3.9 V, 4 V, 4.2 V, or the like. If the first positive electrode <b>151</b><i>a </i>of the first energy storage unit <b>151</b> is made of a material containing lithium element, for example, the first positive electrode <b>151</b><i>a </i>is made of ternary lithium, the first energy storage unit <b>151</b> cannot continue being charged after fully charged; otherwise, the energy storage device or a charger may be damaged or a safety hazard may be caused. It may be considered that when the material of the first energy storage unit <b>151</b> is determined and the first energy storage unit <b>151</b> is used or aged to a certain degree, the full voltage of the first energy storage unit <b>151</b> is a determined value.</p>
<p id="p-0310" num="0309">In this example, a difference between the full voltage of the first energy storage unit <b>151</b> fully charged and the full voltage of the second energy storage unit <b>161</b> fully charged is less than or equal to 1 V. For example, the difference may be 0.5 V, 0.6 V, 0.8 V, 0.9 V, 1 V, or the like.</p>
<p id="p-0311" num="0310">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>22</b></figref>, the charging unit <b>172</b> further includes a charging circuit <b>172</b><i>b </i>disposed between the charging interface <b>174</b> and the first energy storage device <b>150</b> and the second energy storage device <b>160</b>. The charging circuit <b>172</b><i>b </i>may further include a charging branch for charging each energy storage device. For example, the charging circuit <b>172</b><i>b </i>includes a first charging branch <b>1501</b> connected to the first energy storage device <b>150</b> and a second charging branch <b>1601</b> connected to the second energy storage device <b>160</b>. The charging circuit <b>172</b><i>b </i>is electrically connected to the controller <b>175</b>, and the charging interface <b>174</b> is connected to the charging circuit <b>172</b><i>b </i>through a bus A. Alternating current mains or the charge current converted by an external device is transmitted to the bus A through the charging interface <b>174</b> and then transmitted to each energy storage device through the bus A. In this example, the controller <b>175</b> may control, according to detected electrical parameters of the energy storage devices, switching elements in the first charging branch <b>1501</b> and the second charging branch <b>1601</b> to change on states to charge one or more energy storage devices. Switching elements on a charging branch path are turned on in the charging process, and the switching elements on the path are turned off when charging is not performed. The electrical parameter may be a charge current or a charge voltage or temperature of the energy storage unit. For example, the controller <b>175</b> may adaptively distribute the current inputted from the bus A to the energy storage devices to charge all the energy storage devices at the same time, or the current inputted from the bus A may fully charge one energy storage device and then fully charge another energy storage device until all the energy storage devices are fully charged. In an optional example, the controller <b>175</b> may control, according to charging characteristics of different energy storage devices, the charging circuit <b>172</b><i>b </i>such that the energy storage devices are charged at constant currents or constant voltages or in other charging manners.</p>
<p id="p-0312" num="0311">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>23</b></figref>, the charging circuit <b>172</b><i>b </i>further includes an equalization circuit capable of performing charge equalization on one or more energy storage devices in the charging process. For example, a constant current device <b>1721</b> and an equalization switch <b>1722</b> are disposed in the equalization circuit. The constant current device <b>1721</b> is equivalent to a constant current source capable of outputting a small current to perform the charge equalization on the basically fully charged energy storage device, that is, to perform the charge equalization on the energy storage units in the energy storage device. In this example, when one or more energy storage devices are basically fully charged and other energy storage devices are not fully charged yet, the controller <b>175</b> may turn off the charging branches of the basically fully charged energy storage devices and control the equalization switch <b>1722</b> to be turned on. In this manner, the charge current flowing in through the charging interface <b>174</b> is converted into a constant current by the constant current device <b>1721</b> and the constant current performs the charge equalization on the basically fully charged energy storage devices, and the other energy storage devices are still charged at normal charge currents. For example, when the second energy storage device <b>160</b> is basically charged to the full voltage, the controller <b>175</b> may control the second charging branch <b>1601</b> to be turned off and control the equalization circuit to be turned on, so as to perform the charge equalization on the second energy storage device <b>160</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0313" num="0312">In this example, the constant current outputted by the constant current device <b>1721</b> is greater than or equal to 20 mA and less than or equal to 50 mA. The normal charge current outputted from the bus A to each energy storage device for normal charging is greater than or equal to 0.1 C and less than or equal to 2 C.</p>
<p id="p-0314" num="0313">In an example, a total full voltage of the second energy storage device <b>160</b> is lower than a total full voltage of the first energy storage device <b>150</b>. Therefore, in the case where the first energy storage device <b>150</b> and the second energy storage device <b>160</b> are charged at the same time, the second energy storage device <b>160</b> may be fully charged earlier. Therefore, the controller <b>175</b> may control the equalization circuit to be turned on to perform the charge equalization on the second energy storage device <b>160</b> at a small current. In this example, after the at least one second energy storage unit <b>161</b> reaches the full voltage, the equalization circuit is turned on to perform the charge equalization on the second energy storage device <b>160</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0315" num="0314">In this example, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>24</b></figref>, a charging path corresponding to each energy storage unit corresponds to one control switch, and whether to access an equalization current inputted by the constant current device <b>1721</b> can be selected through the control switch.</p>
<p id="p-0316" num="0315">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>25</b></figref>, the charging process of any energy storage device may include a precharging stage, a constant current charging stage, and a constant voltage charging stage. The energy storage device is basically fully charged at a later stage of the constant voltage charging stage or at the end of the constant voltage charging stage. If the charge equalization is performed on the energy storage device immediately after the constant voltage charging stage ends, the energy storage unit at a charging end may have the problem of voltage divergence. To avoid the preceding problem, the controller <b>175</b> may turn off the corresponding charging branch when any energy storage device is basically fully charged or at the end of the constant voltage charging stage and turn on the equalization circuit after a preset time so as to perform the charge equalization on the energy storage device. In this example, the basically fully charged energy storage device is in a rest stage within the preset time. For example, the second energy storage device <b>160</b> may be charged and rest according to different charging stages shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>25</b></figref>. At the end of the rest stage, the controller <b>175</b> may control the second charging branch <b>1601</b> to be turned off and control the equalization circuit to be turned on, so as to perform the charge equalization on the second energy storage device <b>160</b>. For example, the charge current in a charge equalization stage may be 30 mA.</p>
<p id="p-0317" num="0316">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>26</b></figref>, the charging unit <b>172</b> may further include a charging and discharging circuit <b>172</b><i>c</i>, where the charging and discharging circuit <b>172</b><i>c </i>includes at least a charge switch Q<b>18</b> and a discharge switch Q<b>19</b>. An end of the charging and discharging circuit <b>172</b><i>c </i>is connected to the first energy storage device <b>150</b> or the second energy storage device <b>160</b> or both the two energy storage devices, and the other end of the charging and discharging circuit <b>172</b><i>c </i>is connected to the electric motor. When the outdoor moving device <b>100</b> normally moves or mows grass, the discharge switch Q<b>19</b> is turned on, the charge switch Q<b>18</b> is turned off, and electrical energy flows out from the energy storage device to supply power to the electric motor. When the rotational speed of the electric motor decreases, windings of the electric motor can cut a magnetic field to generate a reverse charge current, and the charge current charges the energy storage device through the charging and discharging circuit <b>172</b><i>c</i>. The electric motor may include any one or both of the moving electric motor and the drive electric motor. When the rotational speed of the electric motor decreases, the outdoor moving device <b>100</b> may brake, turn, climb a slope, or perform other actions.</p>
<p id="p-0318" num="0317">In an example, an end of the charging and discharging circuit <b>172</b><i>c </i>is connected to the first energy storage device <b>150</b> and the second energy storage device <b>160</b>. When detecting that the rotational speed of the electric motor decreases, the controller <b>175</b> may detect current power or a current voltage of each of the two energy storage devices and the charge current generated by the electric motor may charge one of the energy storage devices which has lower power or a lower voltage. For example, if the power or voltage of the first energy storage device <b>150</b> is lower than the power or voltage of the second energy storage device <b>160</b>, the reverse charge current generated when the rotational speed of the electric motor decreases can be transmitted to the first energy storage device <b>150</b>; on the contrary, the reverse charge current can be transmitted to the second energy storage device <b>160</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0319" num="0318">In an example, an end of the charging and discharging circuit <b>172</b><i>c </i>is connected to the first energy storage device <b>150</b> and the second energy storage device <b>160</b>. When detecting that the rotational speed of the electric motor decreases, the controller <b>175</b> may detect the power of the second energy storage device <b>160</b>. When the power of the second energy storage device <b>160</b> is less than or equal to a power threshold, the reverse charge current generated by the deceleration of the electric motor is transmitted to the second energy storage device <b>160</b>. When the power of the second energy storage device <b>160</b> is greater than the power threshold, the reverse charge current generated by the deceleration of the electric motor is transmitted to one energy storage device with a lower voltage. That is to say, when the charging and discharging circuit <b>172</b><i>c </i>is connected to both the first energy storage device <b>150</b> and the second energy storage device <b>160</b>, when detecting that the rotational speed of the electric motor decreases, the controller <b>175</b> firstly determines, according to the power of the second energy storage device <b>160</b>, whether the charge current generated by the electric motor is used for charging the second energy storage device <b>160</b>. When the charge current generated by the electric motor is not necessarily used for charging the second energy storage device <b>160</b>, a flow direction of the charge current is determined according to voltages of the energy storage devices. In this example, the power threshold may be 50% to 60% of full power of the second energy storage device <b>160</b>. Alternatively, the power threshold may be 60% to 70% of the full power of the second energy storage device <b>160</b>. Alternatively, the power threshold may be 70% to 80% of the full power of the second energy storage device <b>160</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0320" num="0319">The outdoor moving device <b>100</b> further includes two power supply conversion units for converting the electrical energy inputted by the first energy storage device <b>150</b> or the second energy storage device <b>160</b> to supply power to the power supply management module <b>170</b>. In an optional example, part or all of circuits of a first power supply conversion unit and a second power supply conversion unit are disposed on a circuit board where the power supply management module <b>170</b> is located and the first power supply conversion unit and the second power supply conversion unit are electrically connected to the power supply management module <b>170</b> separately. In an optional example, the first power supply conversion unit and the second power supply conversion unit are independently disposed outside the circuit board where the power supply management module <b>170</b> is located and are electrically connected to the power supply management module <b>170</b> through connection lines. In an example, the power supply conversion unit may be a direct current-direct current (DC-DC) conversion unit. The two power supply conversion modules are provided so that when any power supply conversion path fails, the normal power supply from the energy storage device will not be affected.</p>
<p id="p-0321" num="0320">The preceding examples of the outdoor moving device <b>100</b> may be applied to the outdoor tool devices shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>14</b> to <b>21</b></figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0322" num="0321">The electric riding machine shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>27</b></figref> can be an electric machine for working indoors or outdoors. In the present example, the electric riding machine is specifically exemplified by the electric riding lawn mower <b>600</b>. The electric riding lawn mower <b>600</b> can be used for the user to ride. When sitting on the electric riding lawn mower, the user can effectively and quickly trim lawn, vegetation, etc. by operating the electric riding lawn mower. Comparing with walk behind lawn mowers, the electric riding lawn mower <b>600</b> of the present disclosure does not require the user to push the machine, nor does it require the user to walk on the ground, and because its large size brings longer endurance, the user is able to trim larger lawns, and trim for a long time with less tiredness. Furthermore, when it comes to power source, the electric riding lawn mower <b>600</b> uses electrical energy rather than gasoline or diesel used by existing riding lawn mowers; this not only costs less and is more environmentally friendly, but also requires part replacement less often, reducing maintenance costs.</p>
<p id="p-0323" num="0322">It can be understood that the electric riding machine may be other types of electric machines, as long as the electric machines can output power in other forms in addition to walking power to fulfil other functions besides walking, the electric machines can be considered as riding electric machines, such as riding snow throwers, riding agricultural machines, riding mops, riding sweepers and the like. In fact, as long as these tools include the substance described below in this disclosure, they all fall within the scope of this disclosure.</p>
<p id="p-0324" num="0323">In order to facilitate the description of the technical solution of the present disclosure, the front side, the rear side, the upper side, the lower side, the left side, and the right side are defined as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>27</b></figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0325" num="0324">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>27</b>-<b>38</b></figref>, the electric riding lawn mower <b>600</b> includes a main frame <b>61</b>, a seat <b>62</b>, a power output assembly <b>63</b>, a walking assembly <b>64</b>, an operating assembly <b>65</b>, and a power supply device <b>66</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0326" num="0325">The main frame <b>61</b> is used to carry various modules of the electric riding lawn mower <b>600</b>. Specifically, the main frame is used to support the seat <b>62</b>, the power output assembly <b>63</b>, the walking assembly <b>64</b>, the operating assembly <b>65</b>, and the power supply device <b>66</b>, and the like. The main frame <b>61</b> extends generally in the front-rear direction. Specifically, the main frame <b>61</b> extends at least partially in a direction parallel to a first straight line <b>601</b> in the front-rear direction. The main frame <b>61</b> includes a frame <b>61</b><i>a </i>and a base <b>61</b><i>b</i>. The frame <b>61</b><i>a </i>includes a first arm <b>611</b>, a second arm <b>612</b>, and a connecting arm <b>613</b> that connects the first arm <b>611</b> and the second arm <b>612</b>. The connecting arm <b>613</b> connects the first arm <b>611</b> and the second arm <b>612</b> such that the first arm <b>611</b>, the second arm <b>612</b>, and the connecting arm <b>613</b> constitute a frame <b>61</b><i>a </i>that supports the base <b>61</b><i>b</i>. The first arm <b>611</b> and the second arm <b>612</b> may be in the front-rear direction. In the present example, the connecting arm <b>613</b> extends in the left-right direction; the number of the connecting arms <b>613</b> is two. One of the connecting arms <b>613</b> connects the first arm <b>611</b> and the second arm <b>612</b> at the front ends thereof, and the other connecting arm <b>613</b> connects the first arm <b>611</b> and the second arm <b>612</b> at the rear ends thereof, such that the first arm <b>611</b>, the second arm <b>612</b> and the two connecting arms <b>613</b> form a substantially rectangular frame <b>61</b><i>a</i>. It is to be understood that the structure of the first arm <b>611</b>, the second arm <b>612</b> and the two connecting arms <b>613</b> is not limited thereto, and the structure of the frame <b>61</b><i>a </i>is not limited thereto. The frame <b>61</b><i>a </i>surrounds the base <b>61</b><i>b</i>, and the shape of the base <b>61</b><i>b </i>is adapted to the shape of the frame <b>61</b><i>a</i>. In the front-rear direction, the base <b>61</b><i>b </i>is provided at the front of the frame <b>61</b><i>a</i>, the base <b>61</b><i>b </i>fills the front portion of the rectangular formed by the surrounding frame <b>61</b><i>a</i>, and the base <b>61</b><i>b </i>is at least partially extended in a plane extending in the front-rear direction, and the base <b>61</b><i>b </i>serves as a work platform to support the user's feet and some mechanisms that can be operated with the user's feet. The seat <b>62</b> is for a user to ride, and the seat <b>62</b> is mounted to the main frame <b>61</b>. The seat <b>62</b> is slidable with respect to the main frame <b>61</b> in the direction of the first straight line <b>601</b>, so that the seat <b>62</b> can be moved forward or backward, so that the user can adjust the position of the seat <b>62</b> in the front-rear direction according to the user's height and usage habits, aiding comfort of the electric riding lawn mower <b>600</b>. The seat <b>62</b> specifically includes a bottom portion <b>621</b> and a backrest. The bottom portion <b>621</b> extends substantially in the front-rear direction, and the backrest portion extends upward from the bottom portion <b>621</b>. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>27</b> and <b>29</b></figref>, when the user sits on the seat <b>62</b>, the user faces the forward direction of the electric riding lawn mower <b>600</b>, i.e., the user faces the front side. The frame <b>61</b><i>a </i>can support the seat <b>62</b>, it should be understood that the frame <b>61</b><i>a </i>may directly support the seat <b>62</b>, and the frame <b>61</b><i>a </i>may also indirectly support the seat <b>62</b> by connecting to other structures. The seat <b>62</b> is provided on the upper side of the frame <b>61</b><i>a</i>. In the front-rear direction, at least half of the seat <b>62</b> is disposed on the rear side of the base <b>61</b><i>b</i>, so that when the user sits on the seat <b>62</b>, the user's feet can be placed on the base <b>61</b><i>b </i>on the front side of the seat <b>62</b>. In this way, on the one hand, the weight of the whole machine can be reduced, and the cost can be saved; on the other hand, the lower side of the seat <b>62</b> can free more space to set the other two parts, thereby saving space.</p>
<p id="p-0327" num="0326">The power output assembly <b>63</b> includes an output member for outputting power to achieve a mechanical function. For example, in the present example, the output member may specifically be a mowing member <b>631</b>. The power outputted by the power output assembly <b>63</b> is the power other than enabling the electric riding lawn mower <b>600</b> to walk on the ground, and different output members enable the power output assembly <b>63</b> to perform different functions, for example, the output member may blow the snow, the output member may sweep the ground, the output member may also plow the field, etc.</p>
<p id="p-0328" num="0327">In the present example, the output member is the mowing element <b>631</b>, which can realize the function of trimming the lawn, cutting the weeds, and the like. Specifically, the power output assembly <b>63</b> is also connected to the main frame <b>61</b>, and in the present example, the power output assembly <b>63</b> can be specifically mounted to the lower side of the main frame <b>61</b>. It should be understood that the main frame <b>61</b> may be directly connected to the power output assembly <b>63</b>, and may also be indirectly connected through other connection structures to the power output assembly.</p>
<p id="p-0329" num="0328">The power output assembly <b>63</b> is disposed substantially on the lower side of the main frame <b>61</b>, which effectively utilizes the space on the lower side of the main frame <b>61</b>, and reduces the size of the entire electric riding lawn mower <b>600</b> in the front-rear direction such that the whole structure is more compact. Furthermore, it also reduces the center of gravity G<b>1</b> of the electric riding lawn mower <b>600</b>, improves the stability of the electric riding lawn mower <b>600</b>, and avoids the problem of machine rollover and backward turning during climbing.</p>
<p id="p-0330" num="0329">The power output assembly <b>63</b> further includes: a first motor <b>632</b> and a chassis <b>633</b>. The mowing element <b>631</b> is used to implement the mowing function; the first motor <b>632</b> is used to drive the mowing element <b>631</b> to rotate at a high speed; the chassis <b>633</b> is formed with an accommodation space to accommodate at least a portion of the first motor <b>632</b> and at least a portion of the mowing element <b>631</b>. The power output assembly <b>63</b> may include one or more mowing element <b>631</b>, and respectively, the number of the first motors <b>632</b> can correspond to the mowing element <b>631</b>. For example, in the present example, the number of mowing elements <b>631</b> is two, which increases the cutting range of the electric riding lawn mower <b>600</b>, thereby improving the cutting efficiency.</p>
<p id="p-0331" num="0330">The walking assembly <b>64</b> is used to enable the electric riding lawn mower <b>600</b> to walk on the lawn and on the ground. In the up-down direction, the walking assembly <b>64</b> is also capable of supporting the main frame <b>61</b> and the various components on the main frame <b>61</b>. The walking assembly <b>64</b> may specifically include a first travelling wheel <b>641</b> and a second travelling wheel <b>642</b>. The first travelling wheel <b>641</b> is disposed on the front side of the second travelling wheel <b>642</b> in the front-rear direction. Therefore, the first travelling wheel <b>641</b> may also be defined as the front travelling wheel, and the second travelling wheel <b>642</b> may also be defined as the rear travelling wheel. In the present example, the number of the first travelling wheels <b>641</b> is 2, and the number of the second travelling wheels <b>642</b> is also <b>2</b>, which can improve the stability of the electric riding lawn mower <b>600</b> in the left-right direction and avoid rollovers on the ground or up the hill. In fact, the walking assembly <b>64</b> may also include only one first travelling wheel <b>641</b> and two second travelling wheels <b>642</b>; alternatively, the walking assembly <b>64</b> may include two first travelling wheels <b>641</b> and one second travelling wheel <b>642</b>; wherein in the direction along the first straight line <b>601</b>, the power output assembly <b>63</b> is at least partially disposed between the first travelling wheel <b>641</b> and the second travelling wheel <b>642</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0332" num="0331">Further, the power output assembly <b>63</b> is disposed substantially between the first travelling wheel <b>641</b> and the second travelling wheel <b>642</b>; in the direction along the first straight line <b>601</b>, the seat <b>62</b> is also at least partially disposed between the first travelling wheel <b>641</b> and the second travelling wheel <b>642</b>, so that the center of gravity G<b>1</b> of the electric riding lawn mower <b>600</b> is located between the first travelling wheel <b>641</b> and the second travelling wheel <b>642</b> in the direction of the first straight line <b>601</b>, thereby improving the balance performance of the whole machine. Further, in the direction along the first straight line <b>601</b>, the seat <b>62</b> is closer to the second travelling wheel <b>642</b> and further from the first travelling wheel <b>641</b>, so that the electric riding lawn mower <b>600</b> can be effectively prevented from rollover during climbing. In the left-right direction, the two first travelling wheels <b>641</b> are respectively located at two sides of the main frame <b>61</b>, and the two second travelling wheels <b>642</b> are also respectively located at two sides of the main frame <b>61</b>; that is, the projections of the two first walking wheels <b>641</b> in a plane perpendicular to the up-down direction are outside the projection of the main frame <b>61</b> in the plane, and the projections of the two second walking wheels <b>642</b> in the plane are also located outside the projection of the main frame <b>61</b> in the plane. In this way, the main load-bearing portion of the electric riding lawn mower <b>600</b> can be placed between the two first travelling wheels <b>641</b> and also between the two second travelling wheels <b>642</b>, so that the electric riding lawn mower <b>600</b> can be further effectively prevented from rolling over.</p>
<p id="p-0333" num="0332">The first travelling wheel <b>641</b> may specifically be a universal wheel that can rotate about the first axis <b>602</b>. The first travelling wheel <b>641</b> has a first diameter. It can be understood that since the first travelling wheel <b>641</b> is a universal wheel, the electric riding lawn mower <b>600</b> can turn, and when the electric riding lawn mower <b>600</b> turns, the first axis <b>602</b> of first travelling wheel <b>641</b> also rotates, and the orientation of the first travelling wheel <b>641</b> rotates. The walking assembly <b>64</b> also includes a second motor <b>643</b> for driving the second travelling wheel <b>642</b> to rotate about the second axis <b>603</b>. The drive from the second motor <b>643</b> allows the walking assembly to drive the entire electric riding lawn mower <b>600</b> to walk on the ground. In this example, the second motor <b>643</b> is independent of the first motor <b>632</b> that drives the mowing element <b>631</b>, so that the structure of the whole machine is simpler and the driving is more convenient. The number of the second motors <b>643</b> is also two, and the two second motors <b>643</b> are capable of driving the two second travelling wheels <b>642</b> respectively. Thus, when the two second motors <b>643</b> drive the respective second travelling wheels <b>642</b> at different rotational speeds, a speed difference is generated between the two second travelling wheels <b>642</b>, thereby causing the electric riding lawn mower <b>600</b> to turn. The second travelling wheel <b>642</b> has a second diameter, and the second diameter of the second travelling wheel <b>642</b> is greater than the first diameter of the first travelling wheel <b>641</b>. Wherein, the second diameter of the second travelling wheel <b>642</b>, the ratio of the second diameter of the second travelling wheel <b>642</b> to the first diameter of the first travelling wheel <b>641</b> is greater than or equal to 1.4 and less than or equal to 2, such that the second diameter of the second travelling wheel <b>642</b> is larger than the first diameter of the first travelling wheel <b>641</b>, so that the electric riding lawn mower <b>600</b> is less likely to roll backward when climbing uphill. The second diameter of the second travelling wheel <b>642</b> cannot be excessively larger than the first diameter of the first travelling wheel <b>641</b> to avoid the risk of the electric riding lawn mower <b>600</b> rolling forward on the downhill slope.</p>
<p id="p-0334" num="0333">In the present example, the distance between the second travelling wheel <b>642</b> and the center of the two second travelling wheels <b>642</b> is defined as c<b>1</b>, i.e., half of the distance between the two second travelling wheels <b>642</b> is considered to be c<b>1</b>. In the present example, with a large number of modelling, test analyses, theoretical analysis, and creative work on the electric riding lawn mower <b>600</b>, it is concluded that in order to avoid rollover when the electric riding lawn mower <b>600</b> climbs the uphill, the ratio of the distance c<b>1</b> between the second travelling wheel <b>642</b> and the center of the two second travelling wheels <b>642</b> to the second diameter of the second travelling wheel <b>642</b> is greater than or equal to 0.5 and less than or equal to 1, such that the distance c<b>1</b> between the second travelling wheel <b>642</b> and the center of the two second travelling wheels <b>642</b> is not excessively large, and the turning radius of the entire electric riding lawn mower <b>600</b> can be reduced, thereby making the electric riding lawn mower <b>600</b> turns faster.</p>
<p id="p-0335" num="0334">Further, the distance between the center of gravity G<b>1</b> of the electric riding lawn mower <b>600</b> and the two second travelling wheels <b>642</b> in the up-down direction is defined as h<b>1</b>. The ratio of the distance h<b>1</b> to the second diameter of the second travelling wheel <b>642</b> is greater than or equal to 0.5 and less than or equal to 0.5 and less than or equal to 1, such that when the second diameter of the second travelling wheel <b>642</b> is fixed, the center of gravity G<b>1</b> of the electric riding lawn mower <b>600</b> can be placed in a reasonable position in the up-down direction. Therefore, the risk of rollover of the electric riding lawn mower <b>600</b> during climbing is reduced. The position of the center of gravity G<b>1</b> of the electric riding lawn mower <b>600</b> can be reasonably improved as the second diameter of the second travelling wheel <b>642</b> is increased. In the present example, the ratio of the distance h<b>1</b> between the center of gravity G<b>1</b> of the electric riding lawn mower <b>600</b> and the center of the two second travelling wheels <b>642</b> in the up-down direction to the distance c<b>1</b> between the second travelling wheel <b>642</b> and the center of the two second travelling wheels <b>642</b> is greater than or equal to k<b>1</b> and less than or equal to k<b>2</b>, that is, k<b>1</b>&#x3c;h<b>1</b>/c<b>1</b>&#x3e;k<b>2</b>, and the setting of k<b>1</b> and k<b>2</b> is related to the dimension of the second diameter of the second travelling wheel <b>642</b>. Thus, when the second diameter of the second travelling wheel <b>642</b> is set, k<b>1</b> and k<b>2</b> can also be set to a reasonable value. Thus, when the distance c<b>1</b> between the second travelling wheel <b>642</b> and the center of the two second travelling wheels <b>642</b> is set small, the rollover issue during climbing can be alleviated by lowering the center of gravity G<b>1</b> of the electric riding lawn mower <b>600</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0336" num="0335">When the center of gravity G<b>1</b> of the electric riding lawn mower <b>600</b> is set high, the distance c<b>1</b> between the second travelling wheel <b>642</b> and the center of the two second travelling wheels <b>642</b> can be increased to prevent the electric riding lawn mower <b>600</b> from rollover during climbing. For example, in the present example, k<b>1</b> has a value of 0.6 and k<b>2</b> has a value of 1.1, such that 0.6&#x3c;h<b>1</b>/c<b>1</b>&#x3e;1.1. More specifically, in a direction perpendicular to the first straight line <b>601</b> and perpendicular to the second axis <b>603</b>, the distance L<b>1</b> between the center of gravity G<b>1</b> of the electric riding lawn mower <b>600</b> and the second axis <b>603</b> is greater than or equal to 0 and less than or equal to 150 mm, that is, the distance L<b>1</b> is greater than or equal to 0 and less than or equal to 150 mm in the up-down direction, so that the center of gravity G<b>1</b> of the electric riding lawn mower <b>600</b> is not too high in the up-down direction. When the user sits on the seat <b>62</b>, the center of gravity will rise to some extent, but since the center of gravity G<b>1</b> of the electric riding lawn mower <b>600</b> is set low, the center of gravity G<b>2</b> of the entirety formed by the user and the electric riding lawn mower <b>600</b> is not too high in the up-down direction, which improves stability. It should be noted that, in the present disclosure, the distance between two points, lines and planes in a certain direction refers to the projection distance of the spatial distance between them in the specified direction.</p>
<p id="p-0337" num="0336">The operating assembly <b>65</b> is for user operation to control the electric riding lawn mower <b>600</b> to walk and output power. The operating assembly <b>65</b> can include a first operating element and a second operating element <b>652</b>. The first operating element is for user to operate to activate the first motor <b>632</b> in the power output assembly <b>63</b> to control the mowing element <b>631</b> to mow. The second operating element <b>652</b> is for user to operate to activate the second motor <b>643</b> in the walking assembly <b>64</b> to control the electric riding lawn mower <b>600</b> to walk on the lawn or on the ground. The number of second operating elements <b>652</b> is two. In the present example, two of the second operating elements <b>652</b> are used to respectively control two of the second motors <b>643</b>. The two second operating members <b>652</b> are respectively disposed on both sides of the seat <b>62</b> such that the two second operating members <b>652</b> on both sides can be more conveniently operated when the user sits on the seat <b>62</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0338" num="0337">The power supply device <b>66</b> is for supplying power to the first motor <b>632</b> and the second motor <b>643</b>. The power supply device <b>66</b> includes a plurality of first battery packs <b>661</b>. Compared with the conventional riding lawn mowers powered by gasoline, the electric riding lawn mower <b>600</b> powered by the first battery pack <b>661</b> is more environmentally friendly and the later usage cost is also lower. In the long run, the cost of the electric riding lawn mower using the first battery pack <b>661</b> will be lower. Compared with riding lawn mowers powered by alternating current, the first battery pack <b>661</b> supplies power without using a long power cord, which is safer and more convenient for mowing. In the present disclosure, the first battery pack <b>661</b> is a lithium battery pack, and the first battery pack <b>661</b> is lighter in weight, higher in charge and discharge efficiency, and longer in service life than other types of battery packs (for example, lead-acid batteries). Further, in the present example, the voltage of the first battery pack <b>661</b> is 56V. It can be understood that the voltage value of the first battery pack <b>661</b> is not limited thereto.</p>
<p id="p-0339" num="0338">The power supply device <b>66</b> is disposed on the rear side of the seat <b>62</b>, and in the height direction, the upper end of the power supply device <b>66</b> is shorter than the seat <b>62</b>, or the upper end of the power supply device <b>66</b> is substantially of the same height to the seat <b>62</b>; further, in the height direction, the upper end of the first battery pack <b>661</b> is shorter than the seat <b>62</b>, or the first battery pack <b>661</b> is substantially of the same height to the seat <b>62</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0340" num="0339">In the present example, the first battery pack <b>661</b> can be detached from the main frame <b>61</b> by the user, that is, the first battery pack <b>661</b> for powering the electric riding lawn mower <b>600</b> is detachably mounted to the main frame <b>61</b>, so that when the power of the first battery pack <b>661</b> is insufficient, the user can detach the first battery pack <b>661</b> for charging, instead of directly charging the electric riding lawn mower <b>600</b>, thereby improving operational convenience; in addition, when the first battery pack <b>661</b> is damaged, the user can conveniently disassemble the first battery pack <b>661</b> for maintenance or directly replace the first battery pack <b>661</b>, which avoids fixing or replacing the riding lawn mower whose battery pack cannot be disassembled, and thus reduces the cost of maintenance at a later stage. Moreover, the ability to disassemble the first battery pack <b>661</b> also allows for differentiated design of products for different platforms or regions, making quality control and manufacture of the entire electric riding lawn mower <b>600</b> easier. Still alternatively, the power tool system <b>6</b> shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>34</b></figref> includes the electric riding lawn mower <b>600</b> and a power tool <b>600</b><i>a </i>in the present disclosure. Wherein, the first battery pack <b>661</b> in the power supply device <b>66</b> for supplying power to the electric riding lawn mower <b>600</b> can be detached and mounted into the electric power tool <b>600</b><i>a</i>, so that the first battery pack <b>661</b> can also power the electric power tool <b>600</b><i>a</i>, that is, the first battery pack <b>661</b> in the power supply device <b>66</b> in the present disclosure can be applied not only to the electric riding lawn mower <b>600</b> but also to other electric power tools <b>600</b><i>a</i>, thereby improving the adaptability of the first battery pack <b>661</b> and the ability of the electric riding lawn mower <b>600</b> to adapt to the first battery pack <b>661</b>. Thus, when the electric riding lawn mower <b>600</b> is not in use, the user can disassemble the first battery pack <b>661</b> for use in other electric power tools <b>600</b><i>a</i>, thereby avoiding waste of resources and reducing usage cost. In other words, when the user needs to use the electric riding lawn mower <b>600</b>, the user can borrow the battery pack in other power tool <b>600</b><i>a </i>as the first battery pack <b>661</b>. In the present example, the first battery pack <b>661</b> is configured to be pluggably mounted by the user to the electric riding lawn mower <b>600</b>, and the first battery pack <b>661</b> is attached and detached by plugging and unplugging, making the operation more convenient, and the positioning of the first battery pack <b>661</b> more accurate.</p>
<p id="p-0341" num="0340">Further, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>35</b></figref>, the first battery pack <b>661</b> includes a plurality of battery cells <b>661</b><i>a </i>connected in series, in parallel, or in a combination of series and parallel. The plurality of battery cells <b>661</b><i>a </i>are combined in one battery case to constitute a whole, and the battery cells <b>661</b><i>a </i>may specifically be lithium-based. Specifically, the power tool <b>600</b><i>a </i>may be a garden tool such as a string trimmer, a hedge trimmer, a blower or a chain saw, a torque output tool such as an electric drill or an electric hammer, a sawing tool such as an electric circular saw, a curve saw or a reciprocating saw, or a grinding tool such as an angle grinder or a sander. In other examples, the first battery pack <b>661</b> can also be configured to power a hand-push power tool, such as a hand-push lawn mower, a hand-push snow blower, and the like. Thus, the first battery pack <b>661</b> of the present disclosure adapted to the electric riding lawn mower <b>600</b> can be pulled out by the user to be applied to the above power tool <b>600</b><i>a</i>, in other words, the user can borrow the battery packs in the power tool <b>600</b><i>a </i>as the first battery pack <b>661</b> to power the electric riding lawn mower <b>600</b>, thereby improving the versatility of the electric riding lawn mower <b>600</b> and reducing the usage cost.</p>
<p id="p-0342" num="0341">In the present example, the area surrounded by the frame <b>61</b><i>a </i>may be divided into a front portion, a middle portion, and a rear portion in the front-rear direction. The base <b>61</b><i>b </i>only fills the front portion of the frame <b>61</b><i>a</i>, and the middle portion and the rear portion of the frame <b>61</b><i>a </i>are not provided with the base <b>61</b><i>b</i>, and the seat <b>62</b> is provided on the upper side of the middle portion of the frame <b>61</b><i>a</i>, so that the lower side of the seat <b>62</b> and the middle portion of the frame <b>61</b><i>a </i>have more space to for other components, so that the structure of the whole machine is more compact. The rear portion of the frame <b>61</b><i>a </i>and the rear side of the seat have a sufficiently large accommodation space which can be used to house the power supply device <b>66</b>. In the present example, the number of the first battery packs <b>661</b> included in the power supply device <b>66</b> is plural; the number of the first battery packs <b>661</b> is at least 4; the number of the first battery packs <b>661</b> is greater than or equal to 4 and less than or equal to 10. Further, in the present example, the number of the first battery packs <b>661</b> is exemplified by six, so that the electric riding lawn mower <b>600</b> is powered by the plurality of first battery packs <b>661</b>, and on the other hand, the endurance capability of the entire electric riding lawn mower <b>600</b> is improved, thereby avoiding the trouble of repeated charging, and improving the efficiency of work; on the other hand, the power supply device <b>66</b> includes a plurality of first battery packs <b>661</b>, and thus the weight of the power supply device <b>66</b> is heavier. For the entire electric riding lawn mower <b>600</b>, the weight of the power supply device <b>66</b> makes up a large proportion of the weight of the entire electric riding lawn mower <b>600</b>. Therefore, disposing the power supply device <b>66</b> in the rear end of the frame <b>61</b><i>a </i>and on the rear side of the seat <b>62</b> locates the power supply device <b>66</b> at the rear end of the electric riding lawn mower <b>600</b>, thereby enabling the center of gravity G<b>1</b> of the electric riding lawn mower <b>600</b> to move backward, further reducing the possibility of rolling over backwards when the electric riding lawn mower <b>600</b> climbs the slope, and improving the safety performance.</p>
<p id="p-0343" num="0342">Further, the center of gravity G<b>1</b> of the electric riding lawn mower <b>600</b> is disposed on the lower side of the seat <b>62</b>. For the entire electric riding lawn mower <b>600</b>, the seat <b>62</b> is substantially in the middle position in the front-rear direction, and the center of gravity G<b>1</b> of the electric riding lawn mower <b>600</b> is disposed on the lower side of the seat <b>62</b>; thus, the user sitting on the seat <b>62</b> only causes the center of gravity G<b>2</b> of both the user and the electric riding lawn mower <b>600</b> to change only in the up-down direction with respect to the center of gravity G<b>1</b> of the electric riding lawn mower <b>600</b> when the user is not sitting on the seat <b>62</b>. The position of the center of gravity G<b>2</b> does not change in the front-rear direction and the left-right direction, so that the risk of rollover caused by the user sitting on the seat <b>62</b> can be further reduced. The center of gravity G<b>1</b> of the electric riding lawn mower <b>600</b> is disposed on the lower side of the seat <b>62</b>. Therefore, regardless of whether a user with a relatively heavy weight or a user with a relatively light weight operates the electric riding lawn mower <b>600</b>, the center of gravity G<b>2</b> of the entirety constructed by the user and the electric riding lawn mower <b>600</b> will not change in the left-right direction and the front-rear direction, thereby improving the stability of the electric riding lawn mower <b>600</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0344" num="0343">As described above, when the center of gravity G<b>1</b> of the electric riding lawn mower <b>600</b> is lowered in the up-down direction, and if the user sits on the seat <b>62</b>, the center of gravity G<b>2</b> of the entirety constructed by the user and the electric riding lawn mower <b>600</b> will also decline relatively. Thus, when the user rides the electric riding lawn mower <b>600</b> of the present disclosure to climb a slope, the second travelling wheel <b>642</b> has a contact point P with the slope surface, and the projection distance between the center of gravity G<b>2</b> of the entirety constructed by the user and the electric riding lawn mower <b>600</b> and the contact point P in the horizontal direction is B. In the direction perpendicular to the first line <b>601</b> and perpendicular to the second axis <b>603</b>, the distance between the center of gravity G<b>2</b> of the entirety constructed by the user and the electric riding lawn mower <b>600</b> and the slope surface is h, that is, in the direction perpendicular to the slope surface, the distance between the center of gravity G<b>2</b> of the entirety constructed by the user and the electric riding lawn mower <b>600</b> and the slope surface is h. Wherein, the following relationship is satisfied between the projection distance B and the distance h:</p>

</p>
<p id="p-0346" num="0344">Wherein, A is the distance between center of gravity G<b>2</b> of the entirety constructed by the user and the electric riding lawn mower <b>600</b> and the second axis <b>603</b> of the second travelling wheel <b>642</b>; the angle a is the angle between the slope surface and the horizontal plane.</p>
<p id="p-0347" num="0345">From the above relationship between the projection distance B and the distance h, the distance A between center of gravity G<b>2</b> of the entirety constructed by the user and the electric riding lawn mower <b>600</b> and the second axis <b>603</b> of the second travelling wheel <b>642</b> is fixed; and when the angle a formed between the slope surface and the horizontal plane is also fixed, the smaller the distance h between the center of gravity G<b>2</b> of the entirety constructed by the user and the electric riding lawn mower <b>600</b> and the slope surface in a direction perpendicular to the first straight line <b>601</b> and perpendicular to the second axis <b>603</b>, the larger the projection distance B between the center of gravity G<b>2</b> of the entirety constructed by the user and the electric riding lawn mower <b>600</b> and the contact point P in the horizontal direction, which makes the electric riding lawn mower <b>600</b> easier to climb and less likely to roll over.</p>
<p id="p-0348" num="0346">The chassis <b>633</b> and the main frame <b>61</b> also need to be separated by a certain distance to allow the chassis <b>633</b> to waggle up and down. Specifically, the distance between the chassis <b>633</b> and the main frame <b>61</b> should be greater than or equal to 20 mm and less than or equal to 60 mm. In another example, it is also necessary to make the distance between the mowing element <b>631</b> and the ground satisfy the requirement of mowing. Specifically, the distance between the mowing element <b>631</b> and the ground should be greater than or equal to 20 mm and less than or equal to 120 mm. In another example, in the present example, the power of the first motor <b>632</b> is greater than or equal to 500 W and less than or equal to 1500 W, and therefore, the size of the space inside the chassis <b>633</b> also needs to meet the size of the first motor <b>633</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0349" num="0347">In the direction along the first straight line <b>601</b>, the distance L<b>2</b> between the center of gravity G<b>1</b> of the electric riding lawn mower <b>600</b> and the second axis <b>603</b> is greater than or equal to 0 and less than or equal to 400 mm, such that the electric riding lawn mower <b>600</b> is not likely to roll over during climbing. In the direction along the first straight line <b>601</b>, The ratio of the distance L<b>3</b> between the center of gravity G<b>1</b> of the electric riding lawn mower <b>600</b> and the first axis <b>602</b> to the distance L<b>2</b> between the center of gravity G<b>1</b> of the electric riding lawn mower <b>600</b> and the second axis <b>603</b> is greater than or equal to 2 and less than or equal to 4, so that the center of gravity G of the electric riding lawn mower <b>600</b> is set at a proper position in a direction along the first straight line <b>601</b>. Therefore, not only can the climbing ability be taken into account, but also the problem of rollover when climbing uphill can be taken into account, and the problem of the overturning when going downhill with the electric riding lawn mower <b>600</b> can also be avoided.</p>
<p id="p-0350" num="0348">The power supply device <b>66</b> includes a battery compartment housing <b>66</b><i>a </i>that includes a main body portion <b>66</b><i>b </i>and a cover <b>66</b><i>c </i>that is pivotally coupled to the main body portion <b>66</b><i>b</i>. The main body portion <b>66</b><i>b </i>may include a first battery compartment <b>662</b> for mounting the first battery pack <b>661</b>, and the power supply device <b>66</b> may include two or more first battery compartments <b>662</b>, and the number of the first battery compartments <b>662</b> may also be a specific plural.</p>
<p id="p-0351" num="0349">Specifically, in this example, the power supply device <b>66</b> includes six first battery compartments <b>662</b>, and the six first battery compartments <b>662</b> are disposed on the rear side of the seat <b>62</b> away from the first travelling wheel <b>641</b>, that is, in the direction of the first straight line <b>601</b>, the first battery compartment <b>662</b> and the first travelling wheel <b>641</b> are respectively disposed on both sides of the seat <b>62</b>. In this way, the weight of the electric riding lawn mower <b>600</b> can be shifted back, thereby increasing the positive pressure of the second travelling wheel <b>642</b> at the rear end to the ground, thereby increasing grip of the second travelling wheel <b>642</b> of the electric riding lawn mower <b>600</b>, and making climbing uphill easier.</p>
<p id="p-0352" num="0350">Correspondingly, the power supply device <b>66</b> includes six first battery packs <b>661</b>, and each of the first battery packs <b>661</b> can be respectively mounted to each of the first battery compartments <b>662</b>. The first battery compartment <b>662</b> may be formed with a first groove <b>662</b><i>a</i>. The first battery pack <b>661</b> can be detachably inserted into the first groove <b>662</b><i>a </i>along the direction of the second straight line <b>604</b>. The first battery pack <b>661</b> can also be pulled out of the first groove <b>662</b><i>a </i>along the direction of the second straight line <b>604</b>. The cover <b>66</b><i>c </i>has an open state and a closed state, and when the cover <b>66</b><i>c </i>is in the open state, the first groove <b>662</b><i>a </i>is opened and the user can insert the first battery pack <b>661</b> into the first groove <b>662</b><i>a</i>; when the cover <b>66</b><i>c </i>is in the closed state, the first groove <b>662</b><i>a </i>is closed to provide a certain protection to the first battery pack <b>661</b> located in the battery compartment housing <b>66</b><i>a</i>. It can be understood that the first battery compartment <b>662</b> can also be provided with a guiding structure <b>662</b><i>b </i>for guiding the first battery pack <b>661</b> to be inserted into the first groove <b>662</b><i>a </i>in the direction of the second straight line <b>604</b>, such that the first battery pack <b>661</b> can be positioned more accurately in the first groove <b>662</b><i>a</i>. The first battery compartment <b>662</b> may also be provided with a latch <b>662</b><i>c </i>for locking the first battery pack <b>661</b> in the first groove <b>662</b><i>a</i>. The latch <b>662</b><i>c </i>can lock the first battery pack <b>661</b>, and allow the first battery pack <b>661</b> to be pulled out. In this way, the waggle of the first battery pack <b>661</b> can be avoided. The first battery compartment <b>662</b> may also be provided with a pop-up structure <b>662</b><i>d </i>for ejecting the first battery pack <b>661</b>, thereby enabling the user to pull out the first battery pack effortlessly. The first battery compartment <b>662</b> is further provided with an input terminal <b>662</b><i>e </i>to electrically connect to the first battery pack <b>661</b>, and the input terminal <b>662</b><i>e </i>is for introducing the electric energy output by the first battery pack <b>661</b> to the electric riding lawn mower <b>600</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0353" num="0351">The direction of the second straight line <b>604</b> in which the first battery pack <b>661</b> is inserted into the first groove <b>662</b><i>a </i>obliquely intersects with the direction of the first straight line <b>601</b>. Further, between the direction of the second straight line <b>604</b> and the direction of the first straight line <b>601</b>, an angle greater than 60 degrees and less than 90 degrees may be formed, enabling the user to easily insert and remove the first battery pack <b>661</b> without squatting. That is, the angle formed between the direction of the second straight line <b>604</b> in which the first battery pack <b>661</b> is inserted into the first groove <b>662</b><i>a </i>and the straight line extending in the up-down direction is greater than 0 degrees and less than or equal to 30 degrees, so that the user can easily insert and remove the first battery pack <b>661</b> without bending largely, thereby making the operation more effortless, and avoiding the user twisting or bending the arm when pulling out the first battery pack <b>661</b>, thereby facilitating the human-machine experience. It can be understood that the six first battery compartments <b>662</b> can also be formed by a single larger battery compartment, that is, the power supply device <b>66</b> may include only one battery compartment, and the plurality of first battery packs <b>661</b> are all installed in this battery compartment.</p>
<p id="p-0354" num="0352">Alternatively, the power supply device <b>66</b> may include only one first battery compartment <b>662</b>; correspondingly, the power supply device <b>66</b> may include only one first battery pack <b>661</b>. That is to say, the number of the first battery compartments <b>662</b> and the number of the first battery packs <b>661</b> are not specifically limited, and the correspondence relationship between the first battery compartment <b>662</b> and the first battery pack <b>661</b> is not limited to the one-to-one correspondence relationship. It can be understood that, in other examples, the direction of the second straight line <b>604</b> in which the first battery pack <b>661</b> is inserted into the first groove <b>662</b><i>a </i>may also be perpendicular to the direction of the first straight line <b>601</b>, and the direction of the second straight line <b>604</b> in which the first battery pack <b>661</b> is inserted into the first groove <b>662</b><i>a </i>may also be parallel to the direction of the first straight line <b>601</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0355" num="0353">In the example, the power supply device <b>66</b> includes six first battery packs <b>661</b>, and the six first battery packs <b>661</b> are disposed on the rear side of the seat <b>62</b>. The six first battery packs <b>661</b> are arranged in a regular shape on the rear side of the seat <b>62</b>. The first battery compartment <b>662</b> disposed on the rear side of the seat <b>62</b> is further disposed on the rear side of the second travelling wheel <b>642</b>. The first battery pack <b>661</b> has a height direction extending in the direction in which it is inserted into the first groove <b>662</b><i>a</i>, and has a longitudinal direction and a width direction perpendicular to the height direction; the dimension of the first battery pack <b>661</b> in the longitudinal direction is greater than the dimension thereof in the width direction. In this example, when the first battery pack <b>661</b> is inserted into the first groove <b>662</b><i>a</i>, the longitudinal direction of the first battery pack <b>661</b> and the second axis <b>603</b> of the second travelling wheel <b>642</b> are parallel to each other, that is, the longitudinal direction of the first battery pack <b>661</b> extends in the left-right direction. Thus, when the user needs to install or remove the first battery pack <b>661</b>, the user does not need to twist the wrist, which improves the comfort of operation.</p>
<p id="p-0356" num="0354">More specifically, the six first battery packs <b>661</b> are arranged in three rows in the front-rear direction, and each row has two first battery packs <b>661</b> arranged in the left-right direction. The two first battery packs <b>661</b> disposed in the left-right direction are defined as one battery unit group, or form a modular power supply device, and the length of the first battery pack <b>661</b> in the left-right direction is greater than the width thereof in the front-rear direction. Thus, two first battery packs <b>661</b> are arranged on a straight line parallel to the left-right direction, and three first battery packs <b>661</b> are arranged on a straight line parallel to the front-rear direction, and the orientation of each first battery pack <b>661</b> is arranged such that its length in the left-right direction is also greater than its length in the front-rear direction. Thus, the dimension of the six first battery packs <b>661</b> is not excessively long in the front-rear direction so as not to increase the size of the entire electric riding lawn mower <b>600</b> in the front-rear direction; and also the dimension of the six first battery packs <b>661</b> is not too small in the left-right direction to effectively utilize the space occupied by the electric riding lawn mower <b>600</b> in the left-right direction. Thereby, the arrangement of the power supply device <b>66</b> is more reasonable, the space is saved, and the modularization is facilitated. It can be understood that when two first battery packs <b>661</b> in the power supply device <b>66</b> are used as one battery unit group, the power supply device <b>66</b> may also include two battery unit groups, and may further include three or more battery unit groups, thereby facilitating modularization of the power supply device <b>66</b> and implementation of a variety of configurations.</p>
<p id="p-0357" num="0355">In the present example, the capacity of a first battery pack <b>661</b> is greater than or equal to 130 Wh and less than or equal to 1000 Wh. Further, the capacity of a first battery pack <b>661</b> is greater than or equal to 130 Wh and less than or equal to 500 Wh, so that the discharge time of the first battery pack <b>661</b> can also meet the most basic requirements even when only one first battery pack <b>661</b> is included in the power supply device <b>66</b>; or, when the plurality of first battery packs <b>661</b> included in the power supply device <b>66</b> are out of power and the electric riding lawn mower <b>600</b> needs to perform mowing, one first battery pack <b>661</b> or two first battery packs <b>661</b> may be charged first, and after the charging is completed, the one first battery pack or the two first battery packs <b>661</b> are inserted to the first battery compartment <b>662</b> to supply power. Therefore, because the capacity of the first battery pack <b>661</b> is greater than or equal to 130 Wh, the discharge time of the first battery pack <b>661</b> can meet the urgent needs of the user to cut a part of the grass, in other words, does not delay the use. It can be understood that, in the present disclosure, when any of the first battery packs <b>661</b> is installed in the battery compartment housing <b>66</b><i>a</i>, the electric riding lawn mower <b>600</b> can be operated, that is, in the present disclosure, the electric riding lawn mower <b>600</b> is not limited to operate only if all of the first battery compartments <b>662</b> are installed with the first battery packs <b>661</b> capable of supplying power. Alternatively, when the plurality of first battery packs <b>661</b> are mounted to the battery compartment housing <b>66</b><i>a</i>, and some of the first battery packs <b>661</b> are depleted, the electric riding lawn mower <b>600</b> can still operate, thereby improving work efficiency. Further, in the present example, the weight of one first battery pack <b>661</b> is greater than or equal to 0.1 kg and less than or equal to 4 kg, which eases carrying difficulties due to the excessive weight of the first battery pack <b>661</b>. Further, for considerations to allow the electric riding lawn mower <b>600</b> of the present disclosure to borrow battery packs in other electric power tools, it is also necessary to make the weight of the first battery pack <b>661</b> equal to or greater than 0.1 kg and equal to or less than 4 kg. More preferably, the weight of the first battery pack <b>661</b> is greater than or equal to 1 kg and less than or equal to 4 kg, so that the first battery pack <b>661</b> can satisfy the capacity and discharge time demands when the weight of the first battery pack <b>661</b> is not excessively heavy.</p>
<p id="p-0358" num="0356">On the other hand, the ratio of the discharge power of a single first battery pack <b>661</b> to the nominal voltage of the first battery pack <b>661</b> is greater than or equal to 10 WN and less than or equal to 25 W/V, and further, the ratio of the discharge power of a single first battery pack <b>661</b> to the nominal voltage of the first battery pack <b>661</b> is greater than or equal to 12 W/V and less than or equal to 20 W/V. Specifically, the discharge power of the first battery pack <b>661</b> is greater than or equal to 500 W and less than or equal to 6500 W. Further, the discharge power of the first battery pack <b>661</b> is greater than or equal to 500 W and less than or equal to 3000 W, which enables the first battery pack <b>661</b> to adapt to the high power needs of the electric riding lawn mower <b>600</b> of the present disclosure. In this example, the power supply device <b>66</b> includes a plurality of first battery packs <b>661</b>, and the plurality of first battery packs <b>661</b> provide an overall discharge power of greater than or equal to 2000 W and less than or equal to 4000 W, which enables the electric riding lawn mower <b>600</b> to output high power, and last a long time, saving the trouble of repeated charging.</p>

Therefore, it can be understood that the center of gravity of the electric riding lawn mower <b>600</b> or the center of gravity of the entirety of the electric riding lawn mower <b>600</b> and the user can be understood as either including the grass collecting device <b>67</b> or not including the grass collecting device <b>67</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0371" num="0369">The electric riding lawn mower <b>700</b> of the second example shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>39</b></figref> may have the same main frame <b>71</b>, seat <b>72</b>, power output assembly <b>73</b>, walking assembly <b>74</b> and operating assembly <b>75</b> as the electric riding lawn mower in the first example. This example only differs from the first example in that the power supply device <b>76</b> includes a second battery pack <b>763</b> besides the first battery compartment <b>762</b> and the first battery pack <b>761</b> as in the first example. The parts of the first example that are compatible with this example can be applied to this example, and details are not described herein.</p>
<p id="p-0372" num="0370">In the present example, the second battery pack <b>763</b> can be disposed on the lower side of the seat <b>72</b>, so that the center of gravity G of the whole machine in the direction along the first straight line <b>701</b> can be as close as possible to the seat <b>72</b> and the first travelling wheel <b>741</b> in order to effectively avoid the problem of tilting up when the electric riding lawn mower <b>700</b> climbs uphill; and this also increases the positive pressure of the first travelling wheel <b>741</b> against the ground and the grip of the first travelling wheel <b>741</b> to prevent the electric riding lawn mower <b>700</b> from slippage when walking on the ground; further, especially when the rear end of the electric riding lawn mower <b>700</b> is provided with the grass collecting device, the structure of the second battery pack <b>763</b> being disposed on the lower side of the seat <b>72</b> can effectively reduce the center of gravity G of the electric riding lawn mower <b>700</b>, thereby improving the stability of the whole machine. Further, the second battery pack <b>763</b> is also disposed on the front side of the second travelling wheel <b>742</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0373" num="0371">In addition, in the example, the second battery pack <b>763</b> may be fixedly mounted to the main frame <b>71</b>, that is, the second battery pack <b>763</b> is not quickly removable by the user without using auxiliary tools, so that the second battery pack <b>763</b> can be fixed on the main frame <b>71</b> to continuously supply power to the electric riding lawn mower <b>700</b>, thereby avoiding the situation when both the first battery pack <b>761</b> and the second battery pack <b>763</b> in the power supply device <b>76</b> are removed by the user such that the walking assembly <b>64</b> does not have power supply and that the electric riding lawn mower <b>700</b> cannot walk. It can be understood that the second battery pack <b>763</b> can also be configured to be detachable or pluggable by the user.</p>
<p id="p-0374" num="0372">The position of the second battery pack <b>763</b> is not limited to being disposed on the lower side of the seat <b>72</b>, in fact, as long as it is distinguished from the position of the first battery pack <b>761</b> because of considerations in balance performance or structural adaptation of the whole machine, it is within the scope of this disclosure.</p>
<p id="p-0375" num="0373">In the present example, only one second battery pack <b>763</b> is provided on the lower side of the seat <b>72</b>. It can be understood that the second battery pack <b>763</b> on the lower side of the seat <b>72</b> may also be two or more. In the direction perpendicular to the first line <b>701</b> and the first axis <b>702</b>, the distance between the center of gravity of the entirety formed by all the battery packs in the power supply device <b>66</b> and the second axis is less than 300 mm, that is, the distance between the center of gravity of the entirety formed by all the first battery packs <b>761</b> plus all the second battery packs <b>763</b> and the second axis is less than 300 mm, such that the center of gravity of the entire electric riding lawn mower <b>700</b> can be lowered, thereby avoiding the problem of rollover on the slope.</p>
<p id="p-0376" num="0374">In addition, in other examples, it is also possible to configure one or more of the first battery packs <b>761</b> disposed on the rear side of the seat <b>72</b> to be fixedly mounted to the main frame <b>71</b>, which also prevents the electric riding lawn mower <b>700</b> from the problem of being unable to walk due to the lack of power source.</p>
<p id="p-0377" num="0375">In the third example shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>40</b></figref>, the electric riding lawn mower <b>800</b> may have the same main frame <b>81</b>, seat <b>82</b>, power output assembly <b>83</b>, walking assembly <b>84</b> and operating assembly <b>85</b> as the electric riding lawn mower <b>600</b> of the first example. This example only differs from the first example in that the power supply device <b>86</b> includes only a first battery pack <b>861</b> having a larger capacity, and the first battery pack <b>861</b> can be detachably coupled to electric riding lawn mower <b>800</b> with a pluggable approach performed by the user. In the fourth example shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>41</b></figref>, the electric riding lawn mower <b>900</b> may have the same main frame <b>91</b>, seat <b>92</b>, power output assembly <b>93</b>, walking assembly <b>94</b> and operating assembly <b>95</b> as the electric riding lawn mower <b>600</b> of the first example. This example only differs from the first example in that the power supply device includes a power supply interface <b>96</b><i>a </i>for connecting a backpack power supply device <b>910</b> such that when the user sits in the seat <b>92</b>, the user can carry the backpack power supply device <b>910</b> on the back to facilitate the operation of the electric riding lawn mower <b>900</b>.</p>
