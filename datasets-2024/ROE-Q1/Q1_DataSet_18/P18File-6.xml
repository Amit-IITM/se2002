<heading id="h-0001" level="1">TECHNICAL FIELD OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0006" num="0001">The present invention relates to methods for isolating (a) potato proteins, particularly mixtures of functional potato proteins such as patatin and protease inhibitors, and (b) phenolic and/or glycoalkaloid compounds, from potato fruit juice or derivatives thereof.</p>
<heading id="h-0002" level="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0007" num="0002">Many biological fluids and extracts contain soluble proteins and soluble phenolic compounds such as phenolic acids, flavonoids and tannins. This is particularly the case for liquid plant extracts and extracts of e.g. yeast and algae. Many of the phenolic compounds are highly reactive and may e.g. be oxidized to create oligomers and polymers. Such phenolic compounds may adsorb to, and even react covalently with, proteins. The susceptibility of phenolic compounds towards adsorption and/or their covalent reaction with proteins is influenced by many physico-chemical parameters, such as the degree of oxidation, pH, temperature and time of contact.</p>
<p id="p-0008" num="0003">The potato (<i>Solanum tuberosum </i>L.) is a tuber that is largely used as food or in food applications and is a source of different bioactive compounds, such as starch, dietary fibers, amino acids, minerals, vitamins, glycoalkaloid compounds and phenolic compounds.</p>
<p id="p-0009" num="0004">Potato fruit juice is a complex mixture of soluble and insoluble material comprising proteins, starch, minerals, (toxic) glycoalkaloids, (insoluble) fibers and monomeric and polymeric reactive phenols.</p>
<p id="p-0010" num="0005">Phenolic compounds present in potatoes are phenolic acids and flavonoids including flavonols, flavanols, and anthocyanins. Phenolic acids are the most abundant phenolic compounds in potatoes. Chlorogenic acid, which is the ester of caffeic acid and quinic acid, constitutes 90% of the phenolic compounds in potato peels and exists in the form of three main isomers, chlorogenic acid (5-O-caffeoylquinicacid), neochlorogenic acid (3-O-caffeoylquinic acid), and cryptochlorogenic acid (4-O-caffeoylquinic acid). Also, caffeic acid is quantified at 25-72 mg/100 g in potatoes by many researchers. Other phenolic acids such as ferulic acid, gallic acid, and p-coumaric acid have also been quantified in potatoes, ranging from 0-5 mg/100 g dry weight. Furthermore, syringic acid, vanillic acid, sinapic acid, and salicylic acid are present in small quantities (see H. Akyol et al., <i>Int. J. Mol. Sci., </i>2016, 17, pp 835-854).</p>
<p id="p-0011" num="0006">Due to oxidation of natural phenolic compounds, potato fruit juice may turn brown or black. Chemically, the phenolic compounds are oxidized into quinones, which combine into a dark polymer residue. During the oxidation process, the potato proteins may undergo reaction and partial crosslinking. This crosslinking may dramatically reduce the solubility of the potato proteins. Thus, from a technological point of view, the complexity and instability of the potato fruit juice makes the separation and isolation of native potato proteins much more complicated and economically demanding than the isolation of proteins from other types of protein solutions.</p>
<p id="p-0012" num="0007">Purification of potato proteins from potato fruit juice is further complicated by the presence of glycoalkaloids, which must be removed before the potato proteins may be used in human nutrition. Glycoalkaloids are well known anti-nutritional factors. The glycosylated forms of glycoalkaloids, such as &#x3b1;-solanine and &#x3b1;-chaconine, show the highest toxicity. The aglycons, such as solanidine, have a more than 100-fold lower liver toxicity. &#x3b1;-Solanine and &#x3b1;-chaconine make up more than 95% of the total glycoalkaloid content in potatoes. Other glycoalkaloids are for example tomatine, tomatidenol and demissidine. Glycoalkaloids have a bitter taste and negatively affect many of the physical and/or biological properties of potato proteins. For food applications, the taste threshold of glycoalkaloids is about 140-170 mg of glycoalkaloids per kg of product. This threshold strongly limits the applications of known native potato protein isolates in foods.</p>
<p id="p-0013" num="0008">Several compounds, such as proteins and metabolites, comprised in potatoes are valuable and useful in many different applications, such as in nutrition, medical treatments, cosmetics and as acceptable process aids for industrial manufacture of the same. Particularly, patatin and protease inhibitor proteins and phenolic compounds in potato fruit juice or derivatives thereof (waste products of the potato starch manufacturing industry) are interesting and become even more valuable and useful in isolated or more pure form. Patatin and protease inhibitor proteins and phenolic compounds are highly nutritious and have many desirable functional characteristics which could make them useful in both food and industrial products.</p>
<p id="p-0014" num="0009">The potato fruit juice or the derivatives thereof typically also contain insoluble fibers, also known as dietary fibers. Such dietary fibers may have health promoting effects and add functionality when applied as a food ingredient.</p>
<p id="p-0015" num="0010">Native/soluble or at least partially native/soluble patatin and/or protease inhibitor proteins, i.e. not fully denatured or coagulated potato proteins, may be used as techno-functional ingredients in the preparation of foodstuffs, for example to provide (thermo)gelling, foaming, water-binding or emulsification properties. For these purposes, the proteins preferably are devoid of compounds that may give rise to unwanted color and taste formation and/or influence the quality and stability of the prepared food.</p>
<p id="p-0016" num="0011">Patatin is known to have enzymatic activity. It, for example, has phospolipase activity capable of cleaving fatty acids from membrane lipids. Such fatty acid production may negatively affect the flavor of potato proteins isolated from potato fruit juice. Accordingly, such enzymatic activity is unwanted when the potato proteins are to be used as food ingredients in certain applications. In particular, inactivation of the esterase and lipolytic activity of patatins and the inactivation of polyphenol oxidase activity is preferred. It is well known that such inactivation may be performed by extensive heating of the potato proteins. However, such treatment may also lead to uncontrolled polymerization and gelling/denaturation of the proteins, such that the valuable functionality for use in foods is lost or at least significantly decreased.</p>
<p id="p-0017" num="0000">Thus, separation or isolation of (a) native/soluble potato proteins and (b) phenolic and/or glycoalkaloid compounds from potato fruit juice or a derivative thereof, and inactivation of certain enzyme activity is important for obtaining the necessary purity and quality of the native/soluble potato proteins.</p>
<p id="p-0018" num="0012">Membrane filtration, in particular cross-flow ultrafiltration and diafiltration, is a well-known method for separation of high molecular weight compounds, like proteins, from low molecular weight compounds, like small carbohydrates, organic acids and minerals (salts). A widespread example of this technique is the manufacture of whey protein concentrates and whey protein isolates from cheese whey by combined ultrafiltration and diafiltration.</p>
<p id="p-0019" num="0013">Diafiltration, in the context of the present invention, is a technique that uses membranes to completely remove, replace, or lower the concentration of salts and/or other low molecular weight substances from solutions containing proteins, peptides, nucleic acids, and other high molecular weight biomolecules. The process selectively utilizes permeable (porous) membrane filters to separate the components of solutions and suspensions based on their molecular size. An ultrafiltration membrane retains molecules that are larger than the pores of the membrane while smaller molecules such as salts, phenolic and/or glycoalkaloid compounds, solvents and water, may pass through the membrane. In a diafiltration process, water is added to the retentate, while the membrane filtration process continuously removes water, salts and low molecular weight compounds to the permeate side of the membrane.</p>
<p id="p-0020" num="0014">B. Dutr&#xe9; and G. Tragardh, Macrosolute-microsolute separation by ultrafiltration: A review of diafiltration processes and applications, <i>Desalination, </i>1994, 95, pp 227-267, disclose a review of the theory and applications of diafiltration in several commercial scale examples.</p>
<p id="p-0021" num="0015">The prior art discloses membrane processes for the removal of phenolic and/or glycoalkaloid compounds from potato fruit juice.</p>
<p id="p-0022" num="0016">WO97/42834A1, for example, describes in Example 1 a process for the production of undenatured potato protein from potato fruit juice. The potato fruit juice was pretreated causing flocculation of contaminations and subjected to disc stack centrifuging to remove flocculates, other solids and microorganisms. The supernatant obtained after centrifugation was concentrated about 12 times by ultrafiltration using a continuous ultrafiltration unit equipped with polyethersulfone membranes, cut-off value 5 kDa. The retentate was washed by means of diafiltration in the presence of bisulphite to minimise polyphenol oxidation. Diafiltration was continued until salts and metal concentrations had reached acceptable levels. The concentrate was freeze-dried until a dry solid content of 92% was reached. The freeze-dried powder contained 70% protein and no detectable levels of glycoalkaloids. WO97/42834A1 does not comment on the removal of polyphenols from the product.</p>
<p id="p-0023" num="0017">H. J. Zwijnenberg et al., <i>Desalination, </i>144, 2002, pp 331-334, also disclose examples wherein native protein is recovered from potato fruit juice by ultrafiltration and subsequent ultrafiltration. It is described in Zwijnenberg that the potato fruit juice applied contains everything except the starch and fiber. A pretreatment was performed prior to ultrafiltration to reduce the amount of fibers. Diafiltration with tap water was carried out in order to wash out low molecular substances like amino-acids, phenolic components, glycoalkaloids and potassium. The resulting protein was spray-dried in order to get a stable and dry product that could be transported and stored during longer periods.</p>
<p id="p-0024" num="0018">WO2019/215153A1 discloses a process for separation of one or more potato proteins from a group of impurities, amongst which is phenols, in an aqueous solution, said process comprising the steps of:

</p>
<p id="p-0025" num="0026">US2003/077265A1 concerns an ultrafiltration method for the isolation and purification of a proteinase inhibitor extract from potato tubers. The extraction and isolation of the proteinase inhibitor from potatoes begins with the addition of an organic acid, such as formic acid, and a salt to raw potatoes. Undesired proteins are denatured using heat treatment and removed, resulting in an extract solution suitable for ultrafiltration. The ultrafiltration process comprises concentration and diafiltration.</p>
<p id="p-0026" num="0027">For certain separation tasks, such as the separation of proteins from phenolic and/or glycoalkaloid compounds, and in particular the separation of soluble proteins from phenolic and/or glycoalkaloid compounds in plant extracts, the membrane filtration technology is not a complete and cost-efficient process, which may be due to the tendency of phenolic and/or glycoalkaloid compounds to adhere to other compounds such as proteins, polysaccharides as well as the membrane surface.</p>
<p id="p-0027" num="0028">For example, according to several scientific reports (see e.g. K. O Straetkvern and J. G. Schwarz, Recovery of Native Potato Protein Comparing Expanded Bed Adsorption and Ultrafiltration, <i>Food and Bioprocess. Technol., </i>5(5), 2012, pp 1939-1949 and H. J. Zwijnenberg et al., <i>Desalination, </i>144, 2002, pp 331-334), ultrafiltration has low selectivity and only poorly separates polyphenols and brown polyphenol complexes from proteins, thus giving a powder with a final brown hue and higher content of chlorogenic acids. Moreover, membrane concentration of potato fruit juice often leads to fouling of the membranes with corresponding low flux rates, low system productivity and a short membrane lifetime. Both disclosures describe the use of water for the applied diafiltration step. In Zwijnenberg et al. it is illustrated how the permeate flux decreases from the onset of diafiltration using water as the diafiltration solvent.</p>

<heading id="h-0003" level="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0032" num="0037">The present inventors have unexpectedly found that one or more of the objectives can be met by subjecting potato fruit juice or derivatives thereof to a membrane filtration process at industrial scale using diafiltration solvents with an increased ionic strength, which leads to a higher permeability of the membrane for the phenolic and/or glycoalkaloid compounds and a higher average permeate flux during the diafiltration step. Moreover, the present inventors have unexpectedly found that if the membrane filtration process is performed at a pH in the range of 4.5 to 8.5, the enzymatic activity of certain isolated aqueous potato product streams obtained via membrane filtration can be considerably reduced by exposing said isolated aqueous potato product streams to pH values between 2.0 and 4.5 for a specific limited time at a specific temperature. In doing so and after raising the pH again, the unwanted enzymatic activity, such as for example the lipolytic activity of patatins, can be considerably reduced without substantially compromising functionality of the potato proteins in the isolated aqueous potato product streams.</p>
<p id="p-0033" num="0038">Accordingly, in a first aspect, the present invention provides a method for separation of (a) potato proteins and optionally insoluble fibers from (b) first salts and phenolic and/or glycoalkaloid compounds in potato fruit juice or a derivative thereof, said method comprising the steps of:

        <li id="ul0008-0003" num="0045">(iii) adding aqueous diafiltration liquid containing one or more salts to the first retentate obtained in step (ii) to form a diluted first retentate having a conductivity of between 1 mS/cm and 50 mS/cm and subjecting said diluted first retentate to a second cross-flow membrane filtration as diafiltration, to create a second permeate being a diafiltrate containing at least a portion of said phenolic and/or glycoalkaloid compounds and salts and a second retentate comprising potato proteins, salts and optionally insoluble fibers; wherein the pH of the first retentate and the second retentate remains within the range of 4.5 to 8.5, such as in the range of 5.2 to 7.5, preferably in the range of 4.5 to 6.5, such as in the range of 4.8 to 6.5, or 5.0 to 6.5 during step (ii) and step (iii), said method further comprising a step of eliminating or reducing enzymatic activity by exposing:

<heading id="h-0004" level="1">Definitions</heading>
<p id="p-0034" num="0049">The term &#x2018;potato fruit juice or derivatives thereof&#x2019; means the liquid stream after the (industrial scale) separation of potato starch from potatoes (<i>Solanum tuberosum </i>L.) and any aqueous streams derived from processing of such liquid stream by for example flocculation of contaminants and centrifugation, provided that the &#x2018;derivatives thereof&#x2019; still comprise:
<ul id="ul0011" list-style="none">
    <li id="ul0011-0001" num="0000">
    <ul id="ul0012" list-style="none">
        <li id="ul0012-0001" num="0050">protein; and</li>
        <li id="ul0012-0002" num="0051">salts; and</li>
        <li id="ul0012-0003" num="0052">phenolic and/or glycoalkaloid compounds; and</li>
        <li id="ul0012-0004" num="0053">optionally insoluble fibers.</li>
    </ul>
    </li>
</ul>
</p>
<p id="p-0035" num="0054">The term further includes any aqueous stream that may be obtained by disintegration, e.g. by grinding, shredding and/or pressing, of the raw potatoes, peels and cuts from raw potatoes with or without extraction by addition of water or an aqueous extraction solution in combination with physical disruption of the plant tissue and/or cells. The potato fruit juice may also be obtained from potatoes, peels and cuts that have been subjected to a heating process and/or have been subjected to freezing.</p>
<p id="p-0036" num="0055">The term &#x2018;potato protein(s)&#x2019; means protein or proteins present in the tubers of the potato plant <i>Solanum tuberosum </i>L., particularly patatin and/or protease inhibitor.</p>
<p id="p-0037" num="0056">The term &#x2018;functional proteins&#x2019; means proteins that (still) have a high level of their intrinsic techno-functional properties, such as aqueous solubility, the ability to form gels when heated in solution (thermo-gelling), the ability to create foams when aqueous solutions of the protein are whipped with air, or the ability to create emulsions when mixed with lipids in aqueous solutions of the protein. The term &#x2018;functional proteins&#x2019; as used herein is therefore considered similar to the terms &#x2018;soluble proteins&#x2019;, &#x2018;(substantially) native proteins&#x2019; and &#x2018;(substantially) undenatured proteins&#x2019; as used in the art.</p>
<p id="p-0038" num="0057">The term &#x2018;insoluble fibers&#x2019;, also denoted herein as &#x2018;FI&#x2019;, means substances present in the potato fruit juice or in the derivatives thereof that can be separated from the liquid phase by centrifugation in a laboratory centrifuge at 4000 rpm for 30 minutes at room temperature. The precise chemical composition of the insoluble fibers may vary broadly, but may typically comprise insoluble polysaccharides, pectinates, starches and proteins and insoluble complexes of one or more of these substances.</p>
<p id="p-0039" num="0058">The term &#x2018;absorbance at 600 nm&#x2019; as used herein relates to the amount of light of wavelength 600 nm passing through a liquid sample when measured in a spectrophotometer using 10 mm light path cuvettes. The absorbance of a liquid sample is often expressed as O.D. 600 nm. For the purpose of this disclosure, the absorbance is determined by spectrophotometry on samples diluted in 0.05 M potassium phosphate at pH 7.0, wherein, if need be, the pH is adjusted to 7.0 with sodium hydroxide or hydrochloric acid, to a read out in the range of 0.5 to 1.0, and this read out is multiplied with the dilution factor to determine the absorbance of the undiluted sample. If a sample has an absorbance of less than 1.0, no (substantial) dilution is performed, but the pH is nevertheless adjusted to 7.0 with sodium hydroxide or hydrochloric acid. In other words, the &#x2018;absorbance at 600 nm&#x2019; as used herein corresponds to the O.D.600 value of a sample as measured by spectrophotometry using 10 mm light path cuvettes on samples diluted in 0.05 M potassium phosphate at pH 7.0 to a read out in the range of 0.5 to 1.0 and the read out is multiplied with the dilution factor to determine the absorbance of the undiluted sample.</p>
<p id="p-0040" num="0059">The term &#x2018;patatin&#x2019;, also denoted herein as &#x2018;PA&#x2019;, means storage glycoproteins found in potatoes (<i>Solanum tuberosum </i>L.). Patatin represents a group of immunologically identical glycoprotein isoforms with molecular masses in the range of 40-43 kDa. Patatin also has phospolipase activity capable of cleaving fatty acids from membrane lipids. For purposes of the invention, PA may be determined by different known assays, including SDS-PAGE combined with scanning densitometry (e.g. using a GS-900&#x2122; Calibrated Densitometer from BIO-RAD Laboratories, USA) including all protein bands in the molecular weight region between 35 kDa and 60 kDa in the PA category, ELISA testing using patatin specific antibodies, as well as enzymatic assays specific for the phospholipase activity (see e.g. M. Jim&#xe9;nez-Ati&#xe9;nzar et al., Determination of the phospholipase activity of patatin by a continuous spectrophotometric assay, <i>Lipids, </i>2003, 38(6), pp 677-682).</p>
<p id="p-0041" num="0060">The term &#x2018;protease inhibitor&#x2019;, also denoted herein as &#x2018;PI&#x2019;, means potato proteins, which possess molecular weights ranging from about 3 kDa to about 35 kDa, and which are capable of inhibiting the activity of e.g. serine proteases, cysteine proteases, aspartate proteases, and metalloproteases. For purposes of the invention PI may be determined by different known assays, including SDS-PAGE combined with scanning densitometry (e.g. using a GS-900&#x2122;</p>
<p id="p-0042" num="0061">Calibrated Densitometer from BIO-RAD Laboratories, USA) including all protein bands in the molecular weight region between 3 kDa and 35 kDa in the PI category, and more broadly by enzyme inhibition assays as generally described in the art (see e.g. R. E. J. Spelbrink et al., Quantitative Determination of Trypsin Inhibitory Activity in Complex Matrices, <i>The Open Food Science Journal, </i>2011, 5, pp 42-46).</p>
<p id="p-0043" num="0062">The term &#x2018;polyphenol oxidase&#x2019;, also denoted herein as &#x2018;PPO&#x2019;, means in the context of the present invention potato protein. Polyphenol oxidase (tyrosinase) (TY) is a bifunctional, copper-containing oxidase having both catecholase and cresolase activity. PPO causes the rapid polymerization of o-quinones to produce black, brown or red pigments (polyphenols) which cause fruit browning. The amino acid tyrosine contains a single phenolic ring that may be oxidised by the action of PPOs to form o-quinone. Hence, PPOs may also be referred to as tyrosinases. The catalytic action of PPO has a negative impact on the quality of several fruit and vegetable crops and results in alteration of color, flavor, texture, and nutritional value. It is a limiting factor in the handling and technological processing of crops as peeled, sliced, bruised or diseased tissues rapidly undergo browning. For purposes of the invention, PPO may be determined by different known assays as reviewed in: R. Yoruk et al., Physicochemical properties and function of plant polyphenol oxidase: A review, <i>Journal of Food Biochemistry, </i>27(5), 2003, pp 361-422.</p>
<p id="p-0044" num="0063">The term &#x2018;lipoxygenase&#x2019;, also denoted herein as &#x2018;LipO&#x2019;, means in the context of the present invention potato proteins capable of catalyzing the dioxygenation of polyunsaturated fatty acids. Lipoxygenases have food-related applications in bread making and aroma production but they also have negative implications for the color, off-flavour and antioxidant status of plant-based foods. In potatoes (<i>Solanum tuberosum </i>L.), lipoxygenase has a molecular weight of approximately 97 kD and can be detected by SDS-PAGE (see e.g. G. Bauw et al., Patatins, Kunitz protease inhibitors and other major proteins in tuber of potato cv. Kuras, FEBS Journal, 2006, 273, pp 3569-3584). For purposes of the invention LipO may be determined by different known assays, including SDS-PAGE combined with scanning densitometry (e.g. using a GS-900&#x2122; Calibrated Densitometer from BIO-RAD Laboratories, USA) as well as enzyme activity assays as described in e.g. G. E. Anthon et al., Colorimetric method for the determination of lipoxygenase activity, J. Agric. Food Chem., 2001, 49, pp 32-37.</p>
<p id="p-0045" num="0064">The term glycoalkaloids' or &#x2018;alkaloid glucosides&#x2019; means a family of potentially toxic chemical compounds derived from alkaloids to which sugar groups are attached. Prototypical glycoalkaloids present in potatoes (<i>Solanum tuberosum </i>L.) are &#x3b1;-solanine and &#x3b1;-chaconine. In the context of the present disclosure, the level of &#x2018;total glycoalkaloids&#x2019; is expressed as the sum of &#x3b1;-solanine and &#x3b1;-chaconine. For purposes of the invention, glycoalkaloids may be determined by different known assays, including a standard HPLC assay as described in V. Alt et al., Optimization of glycoalkaloid analysis for use in industrial potato fruit juice downstreaming, <i>Eng. Life Sci., </i>2005, 5, pp 562-567.</p>
<p id="p-0046" num="0065">The term &#x2018;first salts&#x2019; means salts that are present in the liquid of the potato fruit juice of the derivative thereof at the outset of the separation process. Accordingly, the first salts include &#x2018;natural salts&#x2019; which are naturally present in potato fruit juice.</p>
<p id="p-0047" num="0066">The term &#x2018;second salts&#x2019; concerns one or more salts added with water during the diafiltration step to increase the conductivity of the diafiltration liquid.</p>
<p id="p-0048" num="0067">The term &#x2018;phenolic compounds&#x2019; means aromatic or heteroaromatic compounds comprising one or more ring systems and one or more phenolic hydroxyl groups. Phenolic compounds from potatoes include phenolics acids, flavonoids, tannins, stilbenes and lignans.</p>
<p id="p-0049" num="0068">The term &#x2018;true protein concentration&#x2019; means the amount of protein per liter of a sample, calculated as the total weight or mass of amino acids per liter as determined by measuring the total nitrogen in a sample by the method of Kjeldahl and using the conversion factor N&#xd7;6.25. All samples are dialyzed against demineralized water in dialysis tubing cellulose membrane (Sigma-Aldrich, USA, cat. No.: D9652) to remove any free amino acids and low molecular weight peptides prior to nitrogen determination.</p>
<p id="p-0050" num="0069">The term &#x2018;thy weight&#x2019; as used in the context of the present invention means the weight or mass of a substance remaining after removal of water by heating at 110&#xb0; C. until the weight does not change anymore. The dry weight per ml sample is thus the remaining weight or mass of a sample of a substance having a volume of 1 ml before drying after removal of water by heating at 110&#xb0; C. until the weight does not change anymore.</p>
<p id="p-0051" num="0070">The term &#x2018;soluble&#x2019; as used in the context of the present invention refers to solubility of compounds in water at a concentration of at least 1 g/L at 25&#xb0; C.</p>
<p id="p-0052" num="0071">The term &#x2018;diafiltration&#x2019; in the context of the present invention means a technique that uses membranes, typically ultrafiltration membranes, to completely remove, replace, or lower the concentration of salts or other low molecular weight substances from solutions containing proteins, peptides, nucleic acids, and other high molecular weight molecules. The process selectively utilizes permeable (porous) membrane filters to separate the components of solutions and suspensions based on their molecular size. An ultrafiltration membrane retains molecules that are larger than the pores of the membrane while smaller molecules such as salts, polyphenols, solvents and water, may pass through the membrane. In a diafiltration process, water or a buffer composition (i.e. the diafiltration liquid) is continuously added to the retentate while the membrane filtration process continuously removes water, salts and low molecular weight compounds to the permeate side of the membrane.</p>
<p id="p-0053" num="0072">The term &#x2018;nanofiltration&#x2019; means a membrane filtration-based method that uses nanometer sized through-pores across the membrane. Nanofiltration membranes typically have pore sizes from 1-10 nanometers, smaller than that used in microfiltration and ultrafiltration, but just larger than that used in reverse osmosis. Nanofiltration membranes are typically defined by the molecular weight cut-off (MWCO) of the membrane used. The nanofiltration membranes typically have a molecular weight cut-off of between 100 and 1000 Da. Nanofiltration is applied in cross-flow mode under increased pressure.</p>
<p id="p-0054" num="0073">The term &#x2018;ultrafiltration&#x2019; means a variety of membrane filtration processes in which forces like pressure or concentration gradients lead to a separation through a semipermeable membrane. Suspended solids and solutes of high molecular weight are retained in the so-called retentate, while water and low molecular weight solutes pass through the membrane in the permeate (filtrate). This separation process is typically used in industry and research for purifying and concentrating macromolecular solutions, especially protein solutions. Ultrafiltration membranes are defined by the pore size or by the molecular weight cut-off (MWCO) of the membrane used. Ultrafiltration membranes typically have a pore size of 0.01-0.1 &#x3bc;m or a molecular weight cut-off of between 1 and 500 kDa, such as between 5 and 50 kDa. Ultrafiltration is applied in cross-flow or dead-end mode. In a continuous process, ultrafiltration is applied in cross-flow mode.</p>
<p id="p-0055" num="0074">The term &#x2018;microfiltration&#x2019; means a separation technique for removing micron-sized particles, like bacteria, suspended solids and colloid particles from liquid solutions. The process uses membrane filters with pores in the approximate size range of 0.1 to 10 &#x3bc;m, which are permeable to the fluid and dissolved substances, but retain certain particles, thus causing separation. Microfiltration membranes are defined by the nominal pore size of the membrane. Microfiltration is applied in cross-flow or dead-end mode. In a continuous process, microfiltration is applied in cross-flow mode.</p>
<p id="p-0056" num="0075">The term &#x2018;turbidity&#x2019; means the measure of relative clarity of a liquid. It is an optical characteristic of water and is a measurement of the amount of light that is scattered by material in the water when light is shined through the water sample. The higher the intensity of scattered light, the higher the turbidity. Material that causes water to be turbid include clay, silt, very tiny particles of inorganic and organic matter and colloid fibers. Turbidity may be measured with a nephelometer. The units of turbidity from a calibrated nephelometer are called Nephelometric Turbidity Units (NTU).</p>
<p id="p-0057" num="0076">The term &#x2018;mineral acids&#x2019; means inorganic acids, preferably the acids hydrochloric acid, nitric acid, phosphoric acid and sulfuric acid.</p>

        <li id="ul0014-0003" num="0095">(iii) adding aqueous diafiltration liquid containing one or more salts to the first retentate obtained in step (ii) to form a diluted first retentate having a conductivity of between 1 mS/cm and 50 mS/cm and subjecting said diluted first retentate to a second cross-flow membrane filtration as diafiltration, to create a second permeate being a diafiltrate containing at least a portion of said phenolic and/or glycoalkaloid compounds and salts and a second retentate comprising potato proteins, salts and optionally insoluble fibers;
<br/>
wherein the pH of the first retentate and the second retentate remains within the range of 4.5 to 8.5, such as in the range of 5.2 to 7.5, preferably in the range of 4.5 to 6.5, such as in the range of 4.8 to 6.5, or 5.0 to 6.5 during step (ii) and step (iii), said method further comprising a step of eliminating or reducing enzymatic activity by exposing:

</li>
    </ul>
    </li>
</ul>
</p>
<p id="p-0070" num="0099">In a preferred embodiment, the process as defined herein is performed at a temperature in the range of 1 to 60&#xb0; C., such as 5 to 55&#xb0; C., 10 to 50&#xb0; C., 15 to 48&#xb0; C., 12 to 45&#xb0; C., 18 to 30&#xb0; C., or 22 to 28&#xb0; C.</p>
<p id="p-0071" num="0100">In another preferred embodiment, the temperature of the first retentate and the second retentate is in the range of 1 to 60&#xb0; C., such as 5 to 55&#xb0; C., 10 to 50&#xb0; C., 15 to 48&#xb0; C., 12 to 45&#xb0; C., 18 to 30&#xb0; C., or 22 to 28&#xb0; C. during step (ii) and step (iii).</p>
<p id="p-0072" num="0101">In a very preferred embodiment, at least part of, more preferably all of the potato proteins remain in solution during the process steps as defined herein.</p>
<p id="p-0073" num="0102">In a preferred embodiment, the first permeate from said first cross-flow membrane filtration process is subjected to a third cross-flow membrane filtration process, whereby at least a portion of the salts present in the first permeate migrate across the membrane into a third permeate and wherein the phenolic and/or glycoalkaloid compounds are retained in a third retentate</p>
<p id="p-0074" num="0103">In this preferred embodiment, the phenolic and/or glycoalkaloid compounds are separated from the one or more first salts present in the first permeate such that the phenolic and/or glycoalkaloid compounds may be isolated in a purified state or a product enriched in the phenolic and glycoalkaloid compounds is obtained as a product of higher value.</p>
<p id="p-0075" num="0104">In another preferred embodiment, the second permeate being a diafiltrate from said second cross-flow membrane filtration process is subjected to a fourth cross-flow membrane filtration process, whereby at least a portion of the salts present in said second permeate being a diafiltrate migrate across the membrane into a fourth permeate and wherein the phenolic and/or glycoalkaloid compounds are retained in a fourth retentate.</p>
<p id="p-0076" num="0105">As a further highly important cost-saving step, the salts thus separated from the phenolic and/or glycoalkaloid compounds may then be recycled for use in the diafiltration step (iii). By doing so, there is not only saved a significant amount of water and salts for the process, but there will also be cost savings related to disposure of waste.</p>
<p id="p-0077" num="0106">Accordingly, in a very preferred embodiment, the fourth permeate is used, at least in part, as the source of said aqueous diafiltration liquid containing one or more salts in claim <b>1</b>, step (iii). In another preferred embodiment, the fourth permeate and the third permeate are used, at least in part, as the source of said aqueous diafiltration liquid containing one or more salts in step (iii).</p>
<p id="p-0078" num="0107">In another embodiment, the fourth permeate is subjected to a reverse osmosis membrane filtration step or evaporation step and the resulting water is used, at least in part, as the source of the water in the aqueous diafiltration liquid in step (iii).</p>
<p id="p-0079" num="0108">As will be appreciated by those skilled in the art, the second cross-flow membrane diafiltration process with this recycle stream can be performed in many ways. When starting the second cross-flow membrane diafiltration process, no fourth permeate is available yet. In a first embodiment, the diafiltration step (iii) starts with aqueous diafiltration liquid without added one or more salts and as soon as the fourth permeate is available from the fourth cross-flow membrane process step, this fourth permeate is recycled and used as aqueous diafiltration liquid in step (iii). In this first embodiment, the one or more salts in the aqueous diafiltration liquid thus solely originate from the one or more first salts. Alternatively, diafiltration step (iii) can be started by using the third permeate as aqueous diafiltration liquid and as soon as the fourth permeate is available from the fourth cross-flow membrane process step, this fourth permeate is recycled and used as aqueous diafiltration liquid. In a second embodiment, the diafiltration step (iii) starts with an aqueous diafiltration liquid containing one or more salts that are one or more second salts that are added to the aqueous diafiltration liquid and that are different from the one or more first salts.</p>
<p id="p-0080" num="0109">Continuously adding fresh aqueous diafiltration liquid in step (iii) and recycling fourth and/or third permeate to the aqueous diafiltration liquid may require purging part of the fourth and/or third permeate to avoid buildup of the diafiltration flow. Continuously adding fresh aqueous diafiltration liquid in step (iii) and recycling fourth and/or third permeate to the diafiltration liquid combined with purging part of the fourth and/or third permeate may be advantageous to avoid buildup of too high concentrations of salts in the aqueous diafiltration liquid.</p>
<p id="p-0081" num="0110">In a preferred embodiment, the method as defined herein is performed as a continuous process. As will be appreciated by the skilled person, if the method as defined herein is performed as a continuous process, the second cross-flow membrane device is positioned downstream of the first cross-flow membrane device, meaning that steps (ii) and (iii) are necessarily performed in different devices. Accordingly, in this embodiment, the first cross-flow membrane and the second cross-flow membrane can be different. In a preferred embodiment, the first and the second cross-flow membrane filtration processes are ultrafiltration processes, wherein the second cross-flow membrane filtration process is performed as diafiltration.</p>
<p id="p-0082" num="0111">In another embodiment, the method as defined herein is performed as a (semi-)batch process wherein steps (ii) and (iii) are subsequently performed using the same cross-flow membrane. In this embodiment, the first and the second cross-flow membrane filtration processes are preferably ultrafiltration processes, wherein the second cross-flow membrane filtration process is performed as diafiltration.</p>
<p id="p-0083" num="0112">In yet another embodiment, the method as defined herein is performed as a (semi-)batch process wherein steps (ii) and (iii) are subsequently performed using different cross-flow membranes, meaning that steps (ii) and (iii) are necessarily performed in different devices.</p>
<p id="p-0084" num="0113">Accordingly, in this embodiment, the first cross-flow membrane and the second cross-flow membrane can be different. In this embodiment, the first and the second cross-flow membrane filtration processes are preferably ultrafiltration processes, wherein the second cross-flow membrane filtration process is performed as diafiltration.</p>
<p id="p-0085" num="0114">In an embodiment, the method as defined herein further comprises the step of subjecting the second retentate to a fifth membrane filtration process resulting in a fifth retentate, wherein at least a portion of the salts migrate across the membrane into a fifth permeate. This embodiment can also be performed as a diafiltration step. Accordingly, in an embodiment, aqueous diafiltration liquid is added to the second retentate to form a diluted second retentate before the fifth membrane filtration process, and the fifth membrane filtration process is performed on the diluted second retentate as a fifth cross-flow membrane filtration as diafiltration, resulting in a fifth permeate being a diafiltrate and the fifth retentate.</p>
<p id="p-0086" num="0115">In an embodiment, the membrane in the fifth membrane filtration process is an ultrafiltration membrane. In another embodiment, the membrane in the fifth membrane filtration process is a microfiltration membrane and at least a portion of the salts and the proteins soluble in the second retentate migrate across the microfiltration membrane.</p>
<p id="p-0087" num="0116">In an embodiment, the fifth retentate is further treated with a sixth cross-flow membrane filtration process whereby the protein is concentrated in a sixth retentate and the salts migrate through the membrane to create a sixth permeate. The resulting sixth permeate comprising salts can be advantageously used as the aqueous diafiltration liquid in the fifth membrane filtration process, if performed as cross-flow diafiltration process. By doing so, there is not only saved a significant amount of water (and salts) for the process, but there will also be cost savings related to disposure of waste.</p>

<p id="p-0209" num="0255">The procedure was as follows. For both tests a 3 inch ROMICON PM30, 1.1 mm i.d. (Koch Membrane Systems, USA) hollow fiber membrane unit with a cut off of 30 kDa was employed. This unit has a membrane area of 2.3 m<sup>2</sup>. The cross flow was set at 34 L/min and the TMP (transmembrane pressure) was regulated to be approximately 1.2 bar. The two 30 L potato fruit juice preparations were each concentrated using ultrafiltration to a retentate volume of 6 L (i.e. the concentration factor was 5&#xd7;) and the clear yellow/brown permeates were collected. Using the built-in heat exchanger of the equipment the temperature of the retentate was kept in the range of 17-20&#xb0; C. during the entire ultrafiltration procedure.</p>
<p id="p-0210" num="0256">Following the 5&#xd7;concentration, the two preparations were diafiltered as follows.

    <li id="ul0026-0001" num="0000">
    <ul id="ul0027" list-style="none">
        <li id="ul0027-0001" num="0257">1A) To the retentate was added 6 L water followed by further ultrafiltration to again reduce the retentate volume to 6 L while the corresponding permeate was collected in a separate vessel labelled &#x2018;dia-permeate 1A&#x2019;. This procedure was repeated to create in total 10 water dia-permeates each of 6 L volume. Following the 10<sup>th </sup>collection of permeate with water one portion of 6 L 0.2 M sodium sulfate was added to the retentate and the ultrafiltration was continued to create the 11<sup>th </sup>permeate. The permeate flux was measured during each of the 11 diafiltration steps and dia-permeate samples were subjected to a semi-quantitative test for the presence of alkaline colored phenolic compounds as described above;</li>
        <li id="ul0027-0002" num="0258">1B) To the retentate was added 6 L 0.1 M sodium sulfate followed by further ultrafiltration to again reduce the retentate volume to 6 L while the corresponding permeate was collected in a separate vessel labelled &#x2018;dia-permeate 1B&#x2019;. This procedure was repeated to create in total 10 sodium sulfate dia-permeates each of 6 L volume. Following the 10<sup>th </sup>collection of sodium sulfate permeate, three portions of 6 L water was added to the retentate and the ultrafiltration was continued to create the 11<sup>th</sup>-13<sup>th </sup>permeate. The permeate flux was measured during each of the 13 diafiltration steps and dia-permeate samples were subjected to a semi-quantitative test for the presence of alkaline colored phenolic compounds as described above.</li>
    </ul>
    </li>
</ul>
</p>
<p id="p-0211" num="0259">The measured average flux values obtained from each dia-permeate is listed in Table 1. As can be seen in Table 1, the flux rates in Example 1A (using water for diafiltration) quickly declines from an initial level at 16 LMH (liter/m<sup>2</sup>/h) to 3 LMH with an average for the first 10 dia-permeates of 6.6 LMH. In contrast, the flux rates in example 1B (using 0.1 M sodium sulfate for diafiltration) show an increase from an initial level of 17 LMH to 20 LMH with an average for the first 10 dia-permeates of 18.5 LMH. The productivity of the membrane system employed was thus approximately 2.8 times higher when applying 0.1 M sodium sulfate for diafiltration relative to the use of water.</p>
<p id="p-0212" num="0260">The semi-quantitative tests for alkaline colored phenols in the dia-permeates further shows that for both Examples 1A and 1B there is a strongly positive score in the first permeates while the scores for Example 1A dia-permeates gradually become lower than for the Example 1B dia-permeates indicating a gradually declining relative permeability of the phenolic substances when using water for diafiltration relative to 0.1 M sodium sulfate.</p>
<p id="p-0213" num="0261">Moreover when changing from water to 0.2 M sodium sulfate for creation of dia-permeate 11A a significant increase in the score is observed, which further indicates that the addition of salts promotes the permeability of the phenolic compounds.</p>
<p id="p-0214" num="0262">The flux decline from 20 LMH to 8 LMH in dia-permeates 11B to 13B illustrates that even when shifting to water for diafiltration after thorough diafiltration with sodium sulfate the flux is still dependent on added salts being present in the retentate.</p>

<p id="p-0216" num="0263">30 L potato fruit juice, produced as described in sections &#x2018;Materials&#x2019; and &#x2018;Assays&#x2019; without any pretreatment to clarify the potato fruit juice, was subjected to ultrafiltration followed by diafiltration. The potato fruit juice, having a true protein concentration of 11.2 g/l, had a pH of 6.0 and a conductivity of 13.3 mS/cm. When the potato fruit juice was diluted with water to a 5 mg/ml true protein concentration and centrifuged in a tabletop centrifuge at 4000 G for 30 minutes, there remained a pellet constituting approximately 1 vol/vol % of the potato fruit juice volume. Accordingly, the potato fruit juice comprised a considerable amount of insoluble fibers. O.D. 600 nm of the potato fruit juice was 1.95 (measured as diluted 3&#xd7; in 50 mM potassium phosphate, at pH 7.0. The resulting absorbance reading was multiplied by 3).</p>
<p id="p-0217" num="0264">The ultrafiltration and diafiltration permeates obtained were mixed and thereafter subjected to nanofiltration for separation of the polyphenols and glycoalkaloids from salts.

<p id="p-0220" num="0267">The flux observed in the beginning of the ultrafiltration process was approximately 35 LMH and thereafter gradually decreased to 15 LMH when the retentate was 5&#xd7; concentrated.

<heading id="h-0031" level="2">Diafiltration</heading>
<p id="p-0221" num="0268">Following the 5&#xd7;concentration using ultrafiltration, 6 L, of 3 g/L sodium sulfite was added to the first retentate (Sigma Aldrich USA, cat. No.: 13471), conductivity=4.1 mS/cm at 18&#xb0; C., followed by further ultrafiltration to again reduce the retentate volume to 6 L while the corresponding permeate was collected in a separate vessel labelled &#x2018;diafiltrate&#x2019;. This procedure was repeated in total 12 times such that in total 72 L diafiltrate was obtained. However, only the first 36 L permeate were collected and stored for the subsequent nanofiltration step. Following the diafiltration with sodium sulfite solution, an additional 3&#xd7;6 L water was added to remove the sodium sulfite from the retentate. The retentate (5.8 L) after diafiltration was labelled &#x2018;retentate&#x2019;.</p>
<p id="p-0222" num="0269">During diafiltration, a gradual increase of flux was observed and at the final stages the flux was in the range of 25 LMH when a 6 L diafiltration portion was added. This correlated well with a gradual increase of pH in the retentate for each diafiltration step added which initially had a pH of 5.9 and at the end of diafiltration with sodium sulfite had a pH of 8.3.</p>
<p id="p-0223" num="0270">Analysis of the first 6&#xd7;6 L &#x2018;diafiltrate&#x2019; for alkaline colored phenolic compounds showed that the concentration of phenolic compounds was very high in the first permeate fractions and then gradually decreased for each 6 L permeate fraction. The sixth permeate fraction was estimated to contain less than 10% phenolic compounds than the first permeate. Also, the majority of the total glycoalkaloids were analyzed to be in the first six permeate fractions, although still a significant concentration was also found in the subsequent fractions.</p>
<p id="p-0224" num="0271">A sample of the &#x2018;retentate&#x2019; obtained after diafiltration was diluted 20 times in 50 mM potassium phosphate at pH 7.0 and the O.D. 600 of the diluted sample was measured to be 0.47. Thus, the undiluted retentate had an O.D. 600 nm of 20&#xd7;0.47=9.4. The undiluted retentate had a pH value of 7.8 and a conductivity of 0.8 mS/cm.</p>
<p id="p-0225" num="0272">The dry matter concentration of the retentate was measured to be 6.7%, corresponding to a total protein/insoluble fiber product yield of 5.8&#xd7;67=388.6 g. The true protein content was determined by the Kjeldahl method to be 87% and the total glycoalkaloid content was determined to be 75 mg/kg protein (on a dry matter basis).</p>
<p id="p-0226" num="0273">SDS-PAGE analysis of potato fruit juice, diafiltration permeates and the retentate after diafiltration was carried out as described in the &#x2018;Assays&#x2019; section. Results are depicted in FIG. 6 (lane 1: potato fruit juice; lanes 2-8: diafiltrates step 1-7; lane 9: retentate after diafiltration). The analysis illustrates that the final protein product in the retentate after diafiltration (lane 9) has substantially the same protein composition as the starting material, i.e. potato fruit juice (lane 1). The analysis further illustrates that only very small amounts of potato protein migrates into the diafiltration permeates.</p>

Samples of the permeate and the corresponding retentate were collected when 2 L permeate had been produced, were analyzed for conductivity and were tested for alkaline colored phenolic compounds as described in the &#x2018;Assays&#x2019; section. The nanofiltration process was conducted until the 10 L mixed solution was concentrated to about 3 L and then stopped.</li>
        <li id="ul0029-0002" num="0275">The conductivity of the collected nanofiltration permeate and retentate samples were found to be approximately 6.6 mS/cm and 10.9 mS/cm, respectively. This indicates that most of the salts present in the mixture passed the nanofiltration membrane into the permeate. The semi-quantitative test for alkaline colored phenolic compounds indicated that approximately 65% of the alkaline colored phenolic compounds were retained in the retentate.</li>

        <li id="ul0029-0004" num="0277">The conductivity of the collected nanofiltration permeate and retentate samples were found to be approximately 4 mS/cm and 11.2 mS/cm, respectively. This indicates that approximately one third of the salts present in the mixture passed the membrane into the permeate. A significant additional part of the remaining salts were found to pass the membrane during the 2 diafiltration steps with water, which indicates that the polyphenols and total glycoalkaloids can be efficiently separated from the salts in the mixed solution. The semi-quantitative test for alkaline colored phenolic compounds as well as the test for total glycoalkaloids indicated that no detectable amounts of the alkaline colored phenolic compounds nor total glycoalkaloids were passing the membrane which indicated that this nanofiltration membrane retains approximately 100% of the alkaline colored phenolic compounds and the total glycoalkaloids in the retentate.</li>
        <li id="ul0029-0005" num="0278">The quality of the obtained permeate enables recycling of the permeate and thereby re-use of the water and salts as diafiltration liquid in the diafiltration step to create the &#x2018;diafiltrate&#x2019; after 5&#xd7;concentration of the potato fruit juice as described above. In this way the total water and salt usage of the process according to the invention will be highly reduced.</li>

<p id="p-0228" num="0279">The partly desalted nanofiltration retentate from experiment (B) as described above was applied to a chromatographic column packed with Q Sepharose Fast Flow (Cat no. Q1126, Sigma Aldrich, USA) which was pre-washed and equilibrated with water. The pH of the nanofiltration retentate sample was 6.8. The sample was loaded until the column was nearly completely saturated with the bound phenolic compounds. The run-through (non-bound fraction) from the column was collected and analyzed for the content of alkaline colored phenolic compounds.</p>
<p id="p-0229" num="0280">The phenolic compounds were found to bind strongly to the Q Sepharose Fast Flow adsorbent, which could be observed by visual inspection of the column in the form of a dark-brown band of bound phenols that appeared at the top and gradually filled the column as more sample was applied. The collected run-through was negative in the test for alkaline colored phenolic compounds, which indicates that substantially all phenolic compounds were bound the adsorbent. While the phenolic compounds can be negatively charged at near-neutral to alkaline pH values, the glycoalkaloids will be neutral or slightly positively charged and do therefore not bind to the adsorbent. Accordingly, they will migrate in the run-through fraction, and are thus separated from the phenolic compounds. The bound phenolic compounds could be efficiently released from the adsorbent with 0.1 M sodium hydroxide.</p>

The potato fruit juice, having a true protein concentration of 11.5 g/l, had a pH of 6.0 and a conductivity of 13.1 mS/cm. When the potato fruit juice was diluted with water to a 5 mg/ml true protein concentration and centrifuged in a tabletop centrifuge at 4000 G for 30 min there remained a pellet constituting approximately 1 vol/vol % of the potato fruit juice volume. Accordingly, the potato fruit juice comprised a considerable amount of insoluble fibers.

<p id="p-0240" num="0291">A 20 ml sample of the retentate obtained after the first diafiltration step was divided into two aliquots which were adjusted with sulfuric acid to a pH of 4.0 and 3.0, respectively. The two solutions were then again divided into two aliquots which were incubated at room temperature (RT, 20-23&#xb0; C.) and 40&#xb0; C., respectively, for 3 hrs.

When the temperature is increased to 40&#xb0; C., the inactivation is very effective even after 15 minutes, after which the esterase activity is reduced with a factor of 98. At room temperature and pH 3.0, it is observed that an activity drop of about 85% is reached after about 1 hour and that this level is rather constant until up to about 2 hours after incubation. From a process robustness perspective, it may be preferable to have ample time to perform the operations without changes of the process outcome and it was therefore chosen to perform the next preparative steps at pH 3.0 and room temperature.</p>

<p id="p-0243" num="0294">The retentate after diafiltration was kept in the membrane filtration unit and 6 L, 20 mM sodium sulfate was added (SL 99.8% from Lenzing, Austria adjusted to pH 3.3 with sulfuric acid, conductivity=3.8 mS/cm at 20&#xb0; C.). Thereafter, the pH was adjusted to 3.0 with sulfuric acid while recirculating in the membrane filtration unit using the built-in heat exchanger to keep the temperature in the range of 20-25&#xb0; C.
