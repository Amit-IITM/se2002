A sensor <b>34</b> can monitor how much fresh oil enters the first tank <b>14</b> through inflowing pipe <b>20</b> and how much fresh oil exits the first tank <b>14</b> through outflowing pipe <b>30</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0035" num="0034">With reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b></figref>, the second tank <b>16</b> is illustrated. In this view of the second tank, many of the features correspond to those of the first tank <b>14</b>. For example, there is an inflowing pipe <b>30</b>A of the second tank <b>16</b> which can receive incoming used oil and an outflowing pipe <b>20</b>A of the second tank <b>16</b> which can transfer used oil out of the second tank <b>16</b>. Similarly, a pumping mechanism <b>22</b>, <b>22</b>A driven by electric motor <b>26</b>A facilitates the transport of the used oil in the inflowing pipe <b>30</b>A and the outflowing pipe <b>20</b>A.

<p id="p-0048" num="0047">With reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>5</b> and <b>15</b>, and <b>16</b></figref>, another aspect of the invention will be described. With reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>15</b></figref>, a prior art method of supplying an associated restaurant or other user of cooking oil is illustrated. A first source of supply, such as a delivery vehicle <b>60</b>A is shown in a schematic cutaway view, with containers <b>66</b>A-<b>66</b>E of supplies within the delivery vehicle <b>60</b>A. Containers <b>66</b>A-<b>66</b>E might contain a variety of restaurant supplies, such as napkins, hamburger patties, hamburger buns, frozen French fries, and the like.</p>
<p id="p-0049" num="0048">With continuing reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>15</b></figref>, second and third delivery vehicles <b>60</b>B and <b>60</b>C are also illustrated. Second delivery vehicle <b>60</b>B is configured to have a single container <b>66</b>F to contain fresh oil. The fresh oil can be delivered to the appropriate container or fryer (not shown) in the restaurant by conduit <b>70</b>. Similarly, third delivery vehicle <b>60</b>C is configured to have a single container <b>66</b>G to receive and take away used oil. The used oil can be removed from the appropriate container or fryer (not shown) in the restaurant by conduit <b>72</b> and then stored in the container <b>66</b>G within the third delivery vehicle <b>60</b>C. Note that typical, prior art oil delivery system requires one delivery vehicle <b>60</b>B to bring fresh oil to the restaurant, and then a second delivery vehicle <b>60</b>C, to remove the used oil and take it away from the restaurant. These two delivery vehicles are in addition to the other delivery vehicle <b>60</b>A or vehicles that bring other supplies.</p>
<p id="p-0050" num="0049">With reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>16</b></figref>, the inventive article and method will be described. A first source of supply, such as a delivery vehicle <b>60</b>A is shown in a schematic cutaway view, with containers <b>66</b>A-<b>66</b>E of supplies within the delivery vehicle <b>60</b>A. Containers <b>66</b>A-<b>66</b>E might contain a variety of restaurant supplies, such as napkins, hamburger patties, hamburger buns, frozen french fries, and the like. However, in the inventive method, container <b>66</b>A contains fresh oil and container <b>66</b>B can receive used oil. The fresh oil can be delivered from container <b>66</b>A to the appropriate container or fryer (not shown) in the restaurant by conduit <b>70</b>. The used oil can be removed from the appropriate container or fryer (not shown) in the restaurant by conduit <b>72</b> and then stored in the container <b>66</b>B within the first delivery vehicle <b>60</b>A. In one embodiment of the invention, container <b>66</b>A and container <b>66</b>B located on the delivery vehicle <b>60</b>A can be replaced by placing an article <b>10</b> on the delivery vehicle <b>60</b>A. In this embodiment, a first article <b>10</b> on the delivery vehicle <b>60</b>A will send cooking oil to a second article <b>10</b> located within the restaurant, via the conduits <b>70</b>, <b>72</b> as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>10</b> and <b>15</b></figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0051" num="0050">Note that the inventive oil delivery system requires only one delivery vehicle <b>60</b>A to bring fresh oil to the restaurant, to remove the used oil and take it away from the restaurant, and deliver other, non-oil related supplies to the restaurant.</p>
<p id="p-0052" num="0051">The benefits of this innovative system are many. Timely deliveries are likely more possible because smaller deliveries of supplies occur nearly every day. Smaller trucks can likely be used for deliveries. Fewer accidents in the restaurant's parking lot are likely to occur. A single truck and driver are more likely able to service the restaurant, rather than two or three trucks and drivers. An oil supplier or restaurant do not need to own their own oil tankers or large trucks configured for oil transport. Rather, regular commercial delivery trucks and vehicles can carry the containers necessary to bring fresh oil or receive used oil.</p>
