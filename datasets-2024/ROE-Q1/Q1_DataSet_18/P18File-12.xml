<p id="p-0035" num="0034">Generally, with reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>1</b> through <b>31</b></figref>, which illustrate particular embodiments of an adjustable blade gap clipper (<b>1</b>) and methods of making and using embodiments of an adjustable blade gap clipper (<b>1</b>) to clip a nail(s) (<b>2</b>) extending from the digit(s)(<b>3</b>) of an animal (<b>4</b>), all of which are generically encompassed by the breadth of the inventive adjustable blade gap clipper. For the purposes of this invention the term &#x201c;nail&#x201d; broadly encompasses nails, claws or talons. The term &#x201c;animal&#x201d; broadly encompasses any animal having a nail, and without sacrificing the breadth of the foregoing, includes as illustrative examples, humans, Carnivora (such as, dogs, cats, racoons, hyenas, bears), kangaroos, aye-ayes, lizards, and birds. The term &#x201c;digit&#x201d; encompasses an anatomical member from which a nail extends and without sacrificing the breadth of the foregoing, includes the fingers or toes of land vertebrates.</p>
<p id="p-0036" num="0035">Now, with general reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>1</b> through <b>13</b></figref>, particular embodiments of the adjustable blade gap clipper (<b>1</b>) can include a first leaf member (<b>5</b>) and a second leaf member (<b>6</b>) each including a leaf first end (<b>7</b>A)(<b>7</b>B) opposite a leaf second end (<b>8</b>A)(<b>8</b>B). The first and second leaf members (<b>5</b>)(<b>6</b>) coupled at the first leaf ends (<b>7</b>A)(<b>7</b>B) diverge outwardly approaching the leaf second ends (<b>8</b>A)(<b>8</b>B). The term &#x201c;coupled&#x201d; for the purposes of this invention means in the alternative, interacts directly, directly in contact (whether by mechanical fastener, adhesives, weld, or as a one-piece structure), or indirectly connected as separate structures joined, united or linked together. In particular embodiments, either the first or the second leaf member (<b>5</b>)(<b>6</b>), or both, can be resilient to allow the first or second blade (<b>9</b>)(<b>10</b>), or the first and second blades (<b>9</b>)(<b>10</b>), to move by depressing the first or second leaf member (<b>5</b>)(<b>6</b>), or by concurrently depressing both of the first and the second leaf members (<b>5</b>)(<b>6</b>). The term &#x201c;resilient&#x201d; for the purposes of this invention means able to recoil or spring back into shape after bending, stretching, or being compressed. The first and second leaf members (<b>5</b>)(<b>6</b>) correspondingly include a first blade (<b>9</b>) or a second blade (<b>10</b>) at the leaf second end(s) (<b>8</b>A)(<b>8</b>B). In particular embodiments, the blade first end (<b>10</b>A) or the blade second end (<b>10</b>B) (or both first and second blade ends (<b>10</b>A)(<b>10</b>B) can be hebetated to allow the first or second blade (<b>9</b>)(<b>10</b>) to be laterally slidingly engaged with a nail (<b>2</b>) with greater ease than conventional clippers and to avoid cutting the digit (<b>3</b>).</p>
<p id="p-0037" num="0036">Again, with primary reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>1</b> through <b>13</b></figref>, particular embodiments can further include a post (<b>11</b>) having a post length (<b>12</b>) disposed between a post first end (<b>13</b>) and a post second end (<b>14</b>). The post (<b>11</b>) can pass through first and second leaf member apertures (<b>15</b>)(<b>16</b>) correspondingly disposed in the first and second leaf members (<b>5</b>)(<b>6</b>) proximate said first or second blades (<b>9</b>)(<b>10</b>). As shown in the illustrative example of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>9</b></figref>, the post (<b>11</b>) can, but need not necessarily, be configured as a cylindrical member (<b>11</b>A) having a flat side (<b>11</b>B). The first or second leaf member apertures (<b>15</b>)(<b>16</b>) can correspondingly define a truncated circle (<b>16</b>A) allowing slidable spatial relation of the first or second leaf members (<b>5</b>)(<b>6</b>) along the post (<b>11</b>) between corresponding post first and second ends (<b>13</b>)(<b>14</b>) while substantially barring rotation of the first and second leaf members (<b>15</b>) about the post longitudinal axis (<b>11</b>C). In the illustrative example of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>8</b></figref>, the first leaf member aperture (<b>15</b>) defines an oval aperture (<b>15</b>A) while the second leaf member aperture (<b>16</b>) defines a truncated circle (<b>16</b>A); however, these illustrative examples of the post (<b>11</b>) and leaf member aperture (<b>15</b>)(<b>16</b>) configurations are not intended to preclude other configurations of the post (<b>11</b>) and leaf member apertures (<b>15</b>)(<b>16</b>) in alternatives having similar function. The first and second leaf member aperture (<b>15</b>)(<b>16</b>) have sufficient dimension to accommodate the arc through which the first or second leaf member (<b>5</b>)(<b>6</b>) travels when depressed.</p>
<p id="p-0038" num="0037">Again, with primary reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>1</b> through <b>13</b></figref>, particular embodiments can, but need not necessarily, include a blade gap adjustment assembly (<b>19</b>). The blade gap adjustment assembly (<b>19</b>) can move (M1) along a post first end portion (<b>17</b>) or a post second end portion (<b>18</b>) to correspondingly directly or indirectly engage the first or second leaf member (<b>5</b>)(<b>6</b>). Movement (M1) of the blade gap adjustment assembly (<b>19</b>) along the post first or second end portion (<b>17</b>)(<b>18</b>) correspondingly adjusts the distance between the first and second blades (<b>9</b>)(<b>10</b>) to establish a blade gap (<b>20</b>).</p>
<p id="p-0039" num="0038">Now, with primary reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>8</b> and <b>9</b></figref>, in particular embodiments the blade gap adjustment assembly (<b>19</b>) can comprise a first annular member (<b>21</b>) and a second annular member (<b>22</b>). The first annular member (<b>21</b>) can be connected in fixed spatial relation to a spacer element (<b>23</b>) disposed between the first annular member (<b>21</b>) and the second leaf member (<b>6</b>). The first annular member (<b>21</b>) and the spacer element (<b>23</b>) include a radially inner annular wall (<b>24</b>) configured to slidably engage the post second end portion (<b>18</b>) while substantially barring rotation of the first annular member (<b>21</b>) and the spacer element (<b>23</b>) about the longitudinal axis (<b>11</b>C) of the post second end portion (<b>18</b>). In the illustrative example of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>8</b> and <b>9</b></figref>, the radially inner annular wall (<b>24</b>) defines a truncated circle (<b>24</b>A) which slidably engages the post (<b>11</b>) configured as a cylindrical member (<b>11</b>A) having a flat side (<b>11</b>B) and substantially bars rotation of the first annular member (<b>21</b>) and the spacer element (<b>23</b>) about the post longitudinal axis (<b>11</b>A). The spacer element (<b>23</b>) can have a spacer length (<b>23</b>A) disposed between a spacer first end (<b>23</b>B) engaged to the second leaf member (<b>6</b>) and a spacer second end (<b>23</b>C) connected to the first annular member (<b>21</b>). The spacer element (<b>23</b>) can be configured to dispose the blade gap adjustment assembly (<b>19</b>) in spaced apart relation to the first and second blades (<b>9</b>)(<b>10</b>) to allow insertion of a nail (<b>2</b>) in the blade gap (<b>20</b>) and can further be configured to contact the digit (<b>3</b>) to limit insertion of the digit (<b>3</b>) between the first and second blades (<b>9</b>)(<b>10</b>). The first annular member (<b>21</b>) can extend radially outward of the spacer element (<b>23</b>) to a radially outer circular annular wall (<b>25</b>). The second annular member (<b>22</b>) extends between a radially inner circular annular wall (<b>26</b>) bounding a closed bottom circular recess (<b>27</b>) and a radially outer annular wall (<b>28</b>). The first annular member (<b>21</b>) can be disposed in the closed bottom circular recess (<b>27</b>) having the radially outer circular wall (<b>25</b>) of the first annular member (<b>21</b>) disposed adjacent the radially inner circular wall (<b>26</b>) of the second annular member (<b>22</b>), whereby the second annular member (<b>22</b>) rotates (R<b>1</b>) about the first annular member (<b>21</b>). In particular embodiments as illustrated in the example of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>8</b></figref>, a centrally located threaded aperture (<b>29</b>) in the closed bottom circular recess (<b>27</b>) of the second annular member (<b>22</b>) can be threadingly engaged to the post second end portion (<b>18</b>), whereby rotation (R<b>1</b>) of the second annular member (<b>22</b>) about the first annular member (<b>21</b>) moves (M1) the spacer element (<b>23</b>) in relation to the second leaf member (<b>6</b>) to increase or decrease the blade gap (<b>20</b>) between the first and second blades (<b>9</b>)(<b>10</b>).</p>
<p id="p-0040" num="0039">Again, with primary reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>8</b> and <b>9</b></figref>, a closed end circular channel (<b>30</b>) can, but need not necessarily, be disposed in the closed bottom circular recess (<b>27</b>) of the second annular member (<b>22</b>). A pin (<b>31</b>) outwardly extending from the first annular member (<b>21</b>) slides within the closed end circular channel (<b>30</b>) upon rotation (R<b>1</b>) of the second annular member (<b>22</b>) about the first annular member (<b>21</b>). The pin (<b>31</b>) can engage a channel first closed end (<b>33</b>) or a channel second closed end (<b>34</b>) of the closed end circular channel (<b>30</b>) to delimit rotation (R<b>1</b>) of the second annular member (<b>22</b>) in the clockwise and counter-clockwise rotation about the first annular member (<b>21</b>) to an arc of less than 360 degrees. In particular embodiments, the second annular member (<b>22</b>) can be threadingly engaged to the post second end portion (<b>18</b>) whereby rotation of the second annular member (<b>22</b>) delimited by engagement of the pin (<b>31</b>) with the first and second closed ends (<b>33</b>)(<b>34</b>) of the closed end channel (<b>30</b>) can corresponding define a blade gap range (<b>53</b>) or useful operable variation in the blade gap (<b>20</b>) for an intended application of the adjustable blade clipper (<b>1</b>). Variation in the blade gap range (<b>53</b>) between applications of the adjustable blade clipper (<b>1</b>) can be accomplished by corresponding variation in the thread pitch of the threadingly engaged portions of the second annular member (<b>22</b>) and the post second end portion (<b>18</b>).</p>
<p id="p-0041" num="0040">Now, with primary reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>10</b> through <b>13</b></figref>, embodiments can, but need not necessarily, include a blade gap calibration assembly (<b>35</b>). In the illustrative examples of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>10</b> through <b>13</b></figref>, the second annular member (<b>22</b>) can include a centrally located bore (<b>29</b>&#x2032;) in the closed bottom circular recess (<b>27</b>) through which the post second end portion (<b>18</b>) passes to threadingly engage a blade gap calibration member (<b>36</b>). The blade gap calibration member (<b>36</b>) threadingly engaged to the post second end portion (<b>18</b>) can be rotated (R<b>2</b>) discrete from rotation (R<b>1</b>) of the second annular member (<b>22</b>) about the first annular member (<b>21</b>). Rotation (R<b>2</b>) of the blade gap calibration member (<b>36</b>) moves (M2) the blade gap calibration member (<b>36</b>) along the post second end portion (<b>18</b>) to correspondingly move (M2) the first and second annular members (<b>21</b>)(<b>22</b>) to move the spacer element (<b>23</b>) in relation to the second leaf member (<b>6</b>) to thereby increase or decrease the blade gap (<b>20</b>) between the first and second blades (<b>9</b>)(<b>10</b>). The blade gap (<b>20</b>) can be adjusted by operation of the blade gap calibration member (<b>36</b>) to establish a calibrated distance (<b>37</b>) between the first and second blades (<b>9</b>)(<b>10</b>) useful with respect to subsequent adjustment of the blade gap (<b>20</b>) by rotation (R<b>1</b>) of the second annular member (<b>22</b>) delimited by engagement of the pin (<b>31</b>) with the channel first and second closed ends (<b>33</b>)(<b>34</b>) of the closed end circular channel (<b>30</b>). In particular embodiments, as shown in the illustrative example of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>10</b></figref>, the blade gap calibration member (<b>36</b>) can be rotatably disposed in a second annular member base recess (<b>38</b>) of a second annular member base (<b>39</b>). The second annular member base recess (<b>38</b>) can be configured to receive the entirety of the blade gap calibration member (<b>36</b>) recessed or flush in relation to a second annular member base external surface (<b>40</b>).</p>
<p id="p-0042" num="0041">Again, with primary reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>10</b> through <b>13</b></figref>, particular embodiments, of the blade gap calibration assembly (<b>35</b>) can, but need not necessarily, include blade gap calibration member rotation tool (<b>41</b>) (also referred to as the &#x201c;tool&#x201d;). The tool (<b>41</b>) and the blade gap calibration member (<b>36</b>) can include releasably mateable engaging portions (<b>42</b>)(<b>43</b>) (also referred to as the &#x201c;tool engaging portion&#x201d; and &#x201c;calibration member engaging portion&#x201d;). The tool engaging portion (<b>42</b>) can engage the calibration engaging portion (<b>43</b>) and the tool (<b>41</b>) can be turned to corresponding rotate (R<b>2</b>) the blade gap calibration member (<b>36</b>). In the illustrative example of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>10</b> through <b>13</b></figref>, the tool (<b>41</b>) includes a tool handle (<b>44</b>) terminating in a bifurcated engaging portion (<b>45</b>) have first and second prongs (<b>46</b>)(<b>47</b>). The first and second prongs (<b>46</b>)(<b>47</b>) can be structured to correspondingly insert into a pair of orifices (<b>48</b>)(<b>49</b>) disposed in the blade calibration member (<b>36</b>). The tool handle (<b>44</b>) with the first and second prongs (<b>46</b>)(<b>47</b>) engaged to the pair of orifices (<b>48</b>)(<b>49</b>) can be turned to correspondingly rotate (R<b>2</b>) the blade gap calibration member (<b>36</b>) to establish a calibrated distance (<b>37</b>) between the first and second blades (<b>9</b>)(<b>10</b>).</p>
<p id="p-0043" num="0042">Again, with primary reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>10</b> through <b>13</b></figref>, particular embodiments can, but need not necessarily, include a calibration blade (<b>50</b>). The calibration blade (<b>50</b>) (as shown in the example of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>13</b></figref>) can be inserted between the first and second blades (<b>9</b>)(<b>10</b>) and the blade gap calibration member (<b>36</b>) rotated (R<b>2</b>) to engage the first and second blades (<b>9</b>)(<b>10</b>) with the calibration blade (<b>50</b>). The calibration blade (<b>50</b>) can be withdrawn to establish a calibrated distance (<b>37</b>) between the first and second blades (<b>9</b>)(<b>10</b>) substantially equal to the thickness of the calibration blade (<b>50</b>). The blade gap calibration member (<b>36</b>) can be subsequently fastened in fixed spatial relation to the second annular member (<b>22</b>). As shown in the illustrative example of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>11</b></figref>, a pair of fasteners (<b>51</b>)(<b>52</b>) threadably mated with the second annular member (<b>22</b>) can rotationally engage the blade gap calibration member (<b>35</b>) to fasten the blade gap calibration member (<b>35</b>) in fixed spatial relation to the second annular member (<b>22</b>) of the blade gap adjustment assembly (<b>19</b>). The blade gap (<b>20</b>) having a calibrated distance (<b>37</b>) between the first and second blades (<b>9</b>)(<b>10</b>) allows the blade gap (<b>20</b>) to be subsequently adjusted through a preselected blade gap range (<b>53</b>) calibrated to incremental rotation (R<b>1</b>) of the second annular member (<b>22</b>) of the blade gap adjustment assembly (<b>19</b>) delimited by engagement of the pin (<b>31</b>) with the first and second closed ends (<b>33</b>)(<b>34</b>) of the closed end channel (<b>30</b>). In particular embodiments, a plurality of calibration blades (<b>50</b>) of differing thicknesses can be included allowing different calibrated distances (<b>37</b>) between the first and second blades (<b>9</b>)(<b>10</b>) to afford blade gaps (<b>20</b>) having correspondingly different blade gap ranges (<b>53</b>).</p>
<p id="p-0044" num="0043">Now, with primary reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>1</b> through <b>6</b>, <b>9</b> and <b>13</b></figref>, in particular embodiments, one or more blade gap indexes (<b>54</b>), can but need not necessarily, be circumferentially disposed on the second annular member (<b>22</b>) of blade gap adjustment assembly (<b>19</b>). A blade gap range (<b>53</b>) disposed between a first blade gap (<b>55</b>) and second blade gap (<b>56</b>) can be calibrated to blade gap index first and second end points (<b>57</b>)(<b>58</b>) of the blade gap index (<b>54</b>). Subsequent establishing the calibrated distance (<b>37</b>) between first and second blades (<b>9</b>)(<b>10</b>) of the blade gap (<b>20</b>) (as above described) the blade gap index first end point (<b>57</b>) can be aligned with blade gap index indicator (<b>59</b>) disposed on the first annular member (<b>21</b>) of the blade gap adjustment assembly (<b>19</b>). The blade gap calibration member (<b>36</b>) can subsequently fastened in fixed spatial relation to the second annular member (<b>22</b>) of the blade gap adjustment assembly (<b>19</b>), as above described. Subsequently, the second annular member (<b>22</b>) can then be rotated (R<b>2</b>) to align one of a plurality of indices (<b>60</b>) of a blade gap index (<b>54</b>) with the blade gap index indicator (<b>59</b>) to correspondingly increase or decrease the blade gap (<b>20</b>) in calibrated increments throughout the blade gap range (<b>53</b>) calibrated to the blade gap index (<b>54</b>). As shown in the illustrative example of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>, one or a plurality of blade gap indexes (<b>54</b>) (as shown in the example &#x201c;infant&#x201d;, &#x201c;toddler&#x201d;, &#x201c;adolescent&#x201d;) can be disposed on the second annular member (<b>22</b>). Each blade gap index (<b>54</b>) can, but need not necessarily, include a plurality of indices (<b>60</b>) which can be incrementally spaced apart between blade gap index first and second end points (<b>57</b>)(<b>58</b>), wherein rotation (R<b>1</b>) of the second annular member (<b>22</b>) clockwise or counter clockwise through the arc of one of the plurality of indices (<b>60</b>) opens or closes the blade gap (<b>20</b>) one pre-established unit of distance having constant magnitude between each adjacent pair of the plurality of indices (<b>60</b>). As one illustrative example, if the first and second end points (<b>57</b>)(<b>58</b>) of an blade gap index (<b>54</b>) define one full rotation of the second annular member (<b>22</b>) and the plurality of indices (<b>60</b>) comprise numerical indices (<b>60</b>A) zero (&#x201c;0&#x201d;) through nine (&#x201c;9&#x201d;), and where one full rotation of the second annual member (<b>22</b>) increases or decreases the blade gap (<b>20</b>) about 1.0 millimeter (&#x201c;mm&#x201d;), then clockwise or counter clockwise rotation of the annular grip member one numerical indices (<b>60</b>A) would increase or decrease the blade gap (<b>20</b>) about 0.1 millimeter. As an illustrative example, if the blade gap (<b>20</b>) associated with the numerical indices (<b>60</b>A) 0 disposes the first blade (<b>9</b>) in contact with second blade (<b>10</b>) (0.0 mm), then rotation of the second annular member (<b>22</b>) from a numerical index 0 to numerical index 4 affords a blade gap (<b>20</b>) of about 0.4 mm.</p>
<p id="p-0045" num="0044">As illustrated in the example of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>1</b> through <b>6</b></figref>, in particular embodiments, the blade gap index (<b>54</b>) descriptive indices (<b>60</b>B) including a characteristic or a feature of an animal (<b>4</b>), such as: species, breed, age, sex, height, weight. In the example of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>, a plurality of blade gap indexes (<b>54</b>) include the specific example of descriptive indices (<b>60</b>B) of &#x201c;infant&#x201d;, &#x201c;toddler&#x201d;, &#x201c;adolescent&#x201d;; however, human age ranges (for example 1 month to 5 months, 6 months to 12 months, 2 years to 3 years, 4 years to 5 years ...) might also be utilized. In the instance of infants of humans or other animals (<b>4</b>), the size of the digits (<b>3</b>) and nails (<b>2</b>) can be especially small, and viewable blade gap indexes (<b>54</b>) which can be selected to generate a pre-determined blade gap (<b>20</b>) can be essential or necessitated to clip a nail(s) (<b>2</b>) without inadvertent cutting of the digit(s)(<b>3</b>). In particular embodiments, the blade gap indexes (<b>54</b>) can be removably disposed on the blade gap adjustment assembly (<b>19</b>). A plurality of blade gap indexes (<b>54</b>) can be provided as interchangeable layers (<b>60</b>C) can allow for interchangeable numerical indices (<b>60</b>A) or descriptive indices (<b>60</b>B) correlated with a blade gap (<b>20</b>) useful with different applications of the adjustable blade gap clipper (<b>1</b>).</p>

<p id="p-0060" num="0059">As such, the particular embodiments or elements of the invention disclosed by the description or shown in the figures or tables accompanying this application are not intended to be limiting, but rather illustrative of the numerous and varied embodiments generically encompassed by the invention or equivalents encompassed with respect to any particular element thereof. In addition, the specific description of a single embodiment or element of the invention may not explicitly describe all embodiments or elements possible; many alternatives are implicitly disclosed by the description and figures.</p>
<p id="p-0061" num="0060">It should be understood that each element of an apparatus or each step of a method may be described by an apparatus term or method term. Such terms can be substituted where desired to make explicit the implicitly broad coverage to which this invention is entitled. As but one example, it should be understood that all steps of a method may be disclosed as an action, a means for taking that action, or as an element which causes that action. Similarly, each element of an apparatus may be disclosed as the physical element or the action which that physical element facilitates. As but one example, the disclosure of a &#x201c;clipper&#x201d; should be understood to encompass disclosure of the act of &#x201c;clipping&#x201d; &#x2014; whether explicitly discussed or not &#x2014; and, conversely, were there effectively disclosure of the act of &#x201c;clipping&#x201d;, such a disclosure should be understood to encompass disclosure of a &#x201c;clipper&#x201d; and even a &#x201c;means for clipping.&#x201d; Such alternative terms for each element or step are to be understood to be explicitly included in the description.</p>
<p id="p-0062" num="0061">In addition, as to each term used it should be understood that unless its utilization in this application is inconsistent with such interpretation, common dictionary definitions should be understood to be included in the description for each term as contained in Merriam-Webster&#x2019;s Collegiate Dictionary, each definition hereby incorporated by reference.</p>
<p id="p-0063" num="0062">All numeric values herein are assumed to be modified by the term &#x201c;about&#x201d;, whether or not explicitly indicated. For the purposes of the present invention, ranges may be expressed as from &#x201c;about&#x201d; one particular value to &#x201c;about&#x201d; another particular value. When such a range is expressed, another embodiment includes from the one particular value to the other particular value. The recitation of numerical ranges by endpoints includes all the numeric values subsumed within that range. A numerical range of one to five includes for example the numeric values 1, 1.5, 2, 2.75, 3, 3.80, 4, 5, and so forth. It will be further understood that the endpoints of each of the ranges are significant both in relation to the other endpoint, and independently of the other endpoint. When a value is expressed as an approximation by use of the antecedent &#x201c;about,&#x201d; it will be understood that the particular value forms another embodiment. The term &#x201c;about&#x201d; generally refers to a range of numeric values that one of skill in the art would consider equivalent to the recited numeric value or having the same function or result. Similarly, the antecedent &#x201c;substantially&#x201d; means largely, but not wholly, the same form, manner or degree and the particular element will have a range of configurations as a person of ordinary skill in the art would consider as having the same function or result. When a particular element is expressed as an approximation by use of the antecedent &#x201c;substantially,&#x201d; it will be understood that the particular element forms another embodiment.</p>
<p id="p-0064" num="0063">Moreover, for the purposes of the present invention, the term &#x201c;a&#x201d; or &#x201c;an&#x201d; entity refers to one or more of that entity unless otherwise limited. As such, the terms &#x201c;a&#x201d; or &#x201c;an&#x201d;, &#x201c;one or more&#x201d; and &#x201c;at least one&#x201d; can be used interchangeably herein.</p>
