<heading id="h-0003" level="1">BACKGROUND</heading>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">A table generally includes a tabletop and a supporting frame to support the tabletop. Objects, such as water bottles, bags or umbrellas, are often placed on the tabletop. However, in many cases, a tabletop is relatively small and cannot accommodate all the objects that need to be placed. As such, many objects have to be placed on the ground or stacked on the tabletop. This is neither sanitary nor safe.</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">Given the current state of the art, there remains a need for tables that address the abovementioned issues.</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">The information disclosed in this Background section is provided for an understanding of the general background of the invention and is not an acknowledgement or suggestion that this information forms part of the prior art already known to a person skilled in the art.</p>

The one or more elongated members are disposed adjacent to the outer periphery (a portion or the entire periphery) of the panel and spaced apart from the outer periphery of the panel. This creates one or more gaps between the one or more elongated members and the outer periphery of the panel. The presence of the one or more gaps allows users to hang objects directly or indirectly on any one of the one or more elongated members when desired or needed. For instance, when there are too many objects to put on a table, one can hang some objects (e.g., water bottles, bags, umbrellas, or the like) directly to an elongated member or indirectly (e.g., via a hook or the like) to an elongated member. In addition, with the one or more elongated members, the panel assembly is stronger and the table is more robust.</p>
<p id="p-0042" num="0041">The panel can have any suitable sizes and shapes (regular or irregular), including but not limited to rectangular shapes, square shapes, circular shapes, half circular shapes, oval shapes, oblong shapes or the like. The panel can also include one, two, three, four, or more than four panel units. For instance, in an exemplary embodiment, the panel includes a single panel unit. In another exemplary embodiment, the panel includes two panel units, which can be fixed or movable (e.g., foldable) with respect to each other.</p>
<p id="p-0043" num="0042">The panel can be made of any suitable materials, including but not limited to plastics, woods or metals. In an exemplary embodiment, the panel or each unit of the panel is a unitary piece formed by blow molding plastics such as high-density polyethylene (HDPE), low density polyethylene (LDPE), polypropylene (PP), polyvinyl chloride (PVC), polyethylene terephthalate (PET), thermoplastic elastomers (TPE), or the like. The blow-molded panel or panel unit generally includes a first panel wall, a second panel wall and a generally hollow interior formed between the first and second panel walls. In addition, the panel can have other features, such as depressions, ridges, or the like, monolithically formed with the first and/or second panel walls.</p>
<p id="p-0044" num="0043">The one or more elongated members can include one, two, three, four, five, six or more than six elongated members, and can be disposed along a portion or the entirety of the outer periphery of the panel. An elongated member can have any suitable shapes and lengths. For instance, an elongated member can have a regular or irregular cross section, including but not limited to square, rectangular, circular, oval, oblong, pentagonal or hexagonal shapes. Also, an elongated member can be straight, curved, or partially straight and partially curved. For instance, in an exemplary embodiment, a panel assembly includes a single substantially straight elongated member disposed along a portion of the outer periphery of the panel. In another exemplary embodiment, a panel assembly includes a single curved, bended, or U-shaped elongated member disposed along a majority or the entirety of the outer periphery of the panel. In a further exemplary embodiment, a panel assembly includes two or more elongated members, each of which is disposed at one side of the panel. As used herein, a majority of the outer periphery of the panel refers to more than about 50%, more than about 60%, more than about 70%, more than about 80%, more than about 90%, or greater of the outer periphery of the panel. Further, an elongated member can be made of any suitable materials, including but not limited to woods, plastics, metals or the like. For instance, in some exemplary embodiments, an elongated member is made of a hollow metal tube. In addition, two elongation members can have the same, similar or different configurations in terms of size, shape, length, material or the like.</p>
<p id="p-0045" num="0044">The plurality of connectors can have the same, similar or different configurations. For instance, in an exemplary embodiment, all of the connectors are substantially the same. In another exemplary embodiment, at least one connector is different than another connector.</p>
<p id="p-0046" num="0045">Referring now to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>1</b>A-<b>3</b></figref>, there is depicted exemplary table <b>100</b> in accordance with some exemplary embodiments of the present disclosure. Table <b>100</b> generally includes a panel assembly, such as panel assembly <b>110</b>, and a supporting frame, such as supporting frame <b>120</b>, to support the panel assembly. Panel assembly <b>110</b> includes a panel, such as panel <b>1</b>, and one or more elongated members, generally designated <b>4</b> and more specifically designated <b>4</b><i>a</i>, <b>4</b><i>b</i>, etc. The one or more elongated members are connected to panel <b>1</b> by a plurality of connectors, such as connector <b>31</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0047" num="0046">While panel <b>1</b> is shown to be a single panel unit of a rectangular shape, it should be noted that this is by way of example and is non-limiting. Panel <b>1</b> can include any suitable number of panel units and can have any suitable sizes and shapes. Similarly, while four substantially straight elongated members are shown with one on each side of panel <b>1</b>, it should be noted that this is by way of example and is non-limiting. Panel assembly <b>110</b> can have one, two, three, four, or more than four elongated members. While four substantially the same connectors are shown with one on each corner of panel <b>1</b>, it should be noted that this is by way of example and is non-limiting. Panel assembly <b>110</b> can have two, three, four, or more than four connectors, either the same or different from each other.</p>
<p id="p-0048" num="0047">An elongated member is generally disposed adjacent to but spaced apart from at least a portion of the outer periphery of the panel, thereby creating a gap in between. A gap is generally designated <b>41</b> and more specifically designated <b>41</b><i>a</i>, <b>41</b><i>b</i>, etc. For instance, referring in particular to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b>B</figref>, a first elongated member (e.g., elongated member <b>4</b><i>a</i>) is disposed adjacent to a first portion of the outer periphery of the panel (e.g., outer edge <b>14</b><i>a</i>) and connected to the panel by connectors <b>31</b>. The first elongated member is spaced apart from the first portion of the outer periphery of the panel, thereby creating a first gap (e.g., gap <b>41</b><i>a</i>) between the first elongated member and the first portion of the outer periphery of the panel. Similarly, a second elongated member (e.g., elongated member <b>4</b><i>b</i>) is disposed adjacent to a second portion of the outer periphery of the panel (e.g., outer edge <b>14</b><i>b</i>) and connected to the panel by connectors <b>31</b>. The second elongated member is spaced apart from the second portion of the outer periphery of the panel, thereby creating a second gap (e.g., gap <b>41</b><i>b</i>) between the second elongated member and the second portion of the outer periphery of the panel. The second elongated member can be the same as, similar to, or different than the first elongated member in terms of size, shape, length or material. The second gap (e.g., the spacing between the second elongated member and the second portion of the outer periphery of the panel) can be the same as, similar to, or different than different than the first gap.</p>
<p id="p-0049" num="0048">In some exemplary embodiments, the panel includes a corner between the first and second portions of the outer periphery, e.g., corner <b>18</b>a between outer edge <b>14</b><i>a </i>and outer edge <b>14</b><i>b</i>. In such embodiments, connector <b>31</b> preferably has a first connecting portion, such as connecting portion <b>31</b><i>a</i>, and a second connecting portion, such as connecting portion <b>31</b><i>b</i>. The first connecting portion is configured to connect an end of the first elongated member to the panel, e.g., outer edge <b>14</b><i>a </i>of the outer periphery. The second connecting portion is configured to connect an end of the second elongated member to the panel, e.g., outer edge <b>14</b><i>b </i>of the outer periphery of the panel.</p>
<p id="p-0050" num="0049">In some exemplary embodiments, connector <b>31</b> includes a third connecting portion, such as connecting portion <b>31</b>c, between the first and second connecting portions. Preferably an outer surface of the third connecting portion is rounded or arched to reduce the sharpness of corners and prevent collision incidents. In some exemplary embodiments, a slot, such as slot <b>311</b>, is formed at connector <b>31</b>. The slot can be a through-groove, a through-hole, or the like. In an exemplary embodiment, the slot is formed at the third connecting portion of connector <b>31</b>. Using a cord, lanyard, clasp or the like, small objects such as cups, bottles, smart phones or the like can be hooked or fastened to the slot. In some exemplary embodiments, an outer surface of the third connecting portion is formed with one or more enhancement members <b>312</b> to enhance the strength, flexibility, and/or aesthetic appearance of the connector. Non-limiting examples of enhancement members include creases, wrinkles, grooves, ribs, strips, rims or any combination thereof.</p>
<p id="p-0051" num="0050">In some exemplary embodiments, supporting frame <b>120</b> includes a first support, such as first support <b>21</b><i>a</i>, and a second support, such as second support <b>21</b><i>b</i>. The first support is movably coupled (directly or indirectly) with the panel assembly at a first panel portion of the panel assembly. The second support is movably coupled (directly or indirectly) with the panel assembly at a second panel portion of the panel assembly. In some exemplary embodiments, the first and second supports collectively form one or more pairs of scissor lifts to allow users to change a height of the supporting frame and thus to change a height of the table to meet different uses or preferences. As a non-limiting example, two pairs of scissor lifts are shown.</p>
<p id="p-0052" num="0051">In some exemplary embodiments, each of the first and second support includes two supporting assemblies and a base, such as base <b>23</b>. The two supporting assemblies are disposed substantially parallel to each other, with the base connected to the lower portions of the two supporting assemblies. In some exemplary embodiments, additionally or optionally, each of the first and second support includes one or more cross members, such as cross member <b>22</b>, connected to the middle portions of the two supporting assemblies. In some exemplary embodiments, supporting frame <b>120</b> is substantially the same as or similar to those disclosed in U.S. patent application Ser. No. 15/931,925 (now U.S. Pat. No. 10,939,751 B1), the disclosure of the application is incorporated herein for all purposes by reference in its entirety.</p>
<p id="p-0053" num="0052">Referring now to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>4</b>A-<b>7</b></figref>, there is depicted exemplary table <b>200</b> in accordance with some exemplary embodiments of the present disclosure. Table <b>200</b> generally includes a panel assembly, such as panel assembly <b>210</b>, and a supporting frame, such as supporting frame <b>220</b>, to support the panel assembly.
