<heading id="h-0005" level="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION</heading>
<p id="p-0091" num="0090">With reference now to the FIGS., an example of a cooking system <b>20</b> is illustrated at numeral <b>20</b>. As best shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>1</b> and <b>2</b></figref>, the cooking system <b>20</b> includes a housing <b>22</b> having an exterior heat resistant or non-conductive surface <b>24</b> and an interior surface <b>26</b> that defines an at least partially hollow compartment <b>28</b> arranged within an interior of the housing <b>22</b>. The housing <b>22</b> may be formed as a single unitary body, or alternatively, may be formed by connecting a plurality of pieces together. In addition, the housing <b>22</b> may be made of any suitable material, including but not limited to glass, aluminum, plastic, or stainless steel for example. A liner <b>30</b> may be disposed within at least a portion of the housing <b>22</b>. The liner <b>30</b> may be formed from any suitable conductive material, such as aluminum for example. In an embodiment, the liner <b>30</b> forms at least a portion of the interior surface <b>26</b> and thereby defines at least a portion of the internal compartment <b>28</b> of the housing <b>22</b>. However, it should be understood that other components of the cooking system <b>20</b>, or surfaces thereof, may also define the internal compartment <b>28</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0092" num="0091">A cooking container <b>32</b> is receivable within a portion of the internal compartment <b>28</b> of the housing <b>22</b>, such as a bottom portion of the internal compartment <b>28</b> for example. Although the cooking container <b>32</b> is described herein as being separable from the housing <b>22</b>, embodiments where the cooking container <b>32</b> is movably connected with or integrally formed with the housing <b>22</b> are also contemplated herein. The cooking container <b>32</b> may be a pot formed from a ceramic, metal, or die cast aluminum material. However, any suitable material capable of withstanding the high temperatures required for cooking food products are also within the scope of the disclosure. In an embodiment, the cooking container <b>32</b> is configured to translate along an axis relative to the housing <b>22</b> such that the cooking container <b>32</b> is slidably received within an opening <b>34</b> formed in a wall <b>36</b> of the housing <b>22</b>. Accordingly, in such embodiments, a size and shape of the cooking container <b>32</b> may be complementary to the size and shape of the opening <b>34</b>. In the illustrated, non-limiting embodiment, the cooking container <b>32</b> is generally square in shape. However, in other embodiments, the cooking container <b>32</b> may have another configuration.</p>
<p id="p-0093" num="0092">The cooking container <b>32</b> has a generally hollow interior <b>38</b> for supporting one or more consumable products, such as food products for example, therein. Examples of food products suitable for use with the cooking system <b>20</b>, include but are not limited to, meats, fish, poultry, bread, rice, grains, pasta, vegetables, fruits, and dairy products, among others.</p>
<p id="p-0094" num="0093">At least one handle <b>40</b> may be associated with the cooking container <b>32</b> to allow a user to easily grasp and manipulate the cooking container <b>32</b> relative to the housing <b>22</b>. In the illustrated, non-limiting embodiment, the cooking container <b>32</b> includes a single handle <b>40</b> extending from a first, front surface <b>42</b> of the cooking container <b>32</b>. Although the cooking container <b>32</b> illustrated and described herein has a single handle <b>40</b>, in other embodiments, the cooking container <b>32</b> may have two or more handles, or alternatively, a handle or groove formed into a surface of the cooking container <b>32</b>. Any suitable configuration of the cooking container <b>32</b> and/or handle(s) <b>40</b> is within the scope of the disclosure.</p>
<p id="p-0095" num="0094">One or more inserts or food support structures <b>50</b> may be positionable within the interior <b>38</b> of the cooking container <b>32</b>. In such embodiments, the insert <b>50</b> provides a surface on which food is supported. An example of an insert <b>50</b> suitable for use with the cooking container <b>32</b> is best shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>4</b> and <b>5</b></figref>. As shown, the insert <b>50</b> includes a solid blocking wall <b>52</b> and a food support surface <b>54</b> having a plurality of perforations or openings <b>56</b> formed therein. In the illustrated, non-limiting embodiment, the blocking wall <b>52</b> and the food support surface <b>54</b> are arranged generally perpendicular to one another. Although the insert <b>50</b> is shown as being an L-shaped plate, in other embodiments, the insert <b>50</b> may include additional side walls such that the insert <b>50</b> is a basket for example. When the insert <b>50</b> is installed within the interior <b>38</b> of the cooking container <b>32</b>, the blocking wall <b>52</b> and the food support surface <b>54</b> of the insert <b>50</b> cooperate with one or more walls of the cooking container <b>32</b> to define an area there between referred to herein as a &#x201c;cooking volume.&#x201d; Further, in embodiments where an insert is not disposed within the cooking container <b>32</b>, the interior <b>38</b> of the cooking container <b>32</b> may define the cooking volume.</p>
<p id="p-0096" num="0095">In the illustrated, non-limiting embodiment, the bottom surface <b>58</b> of the cooking container <b>32</b> is sloped relative to a bottom surface of the housing <b>22</b> or to a surface on which the cooking system <b>20</b> may be positioned and supported. As shown, the slope extends generally upwardly towards a front wall <b>60</b> of the cooking container <b>32</b>. As a result, a height of the interior <b>38</b> of the cooking container <b>32</b> adjacent a back wall <b>62</b> is greater than a height of the interior <b>38</b> of the cooking container <b>32</b> adjacent the front wall <b>60</b> thereof. When the insert <b>50</b> is installed within the interior <b>38</b> of the cooking container <b>32</b>, the food support surface <b>54</b> has a generally horizontal orientation. As shown, the insert <b>50</b> may include one or more protrusions <b>64</b>, such as tabs for example, configured to contact the bottom surface <b>58</b> of the cooking container <b>32</b> to achieve this desired orientation. The food support surface <b>54</b> is therefore at least partially offset from the bottom surface <b>58</b> of the cooking container <b>32</b>. Because of the angled configuration of the bottom surface <b>58</b> of the cooking container <b>32</b>, the clearance <b>66</b> between the bottom surface <b>58</b> and the food support surface <b>54</b>, varies, and more specifically, gradually decreases from a back to a front of the cooking container <b>32</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0097" num="0096">The insert <b>50</b> and the bottom surface <b>58</b> of the cooking container <b>32</b> may cooperate to properly position the insert within the interior <b>38</b> such that the blocking wall <b>52</b> of the insert <b>50</b> is offset from the back wall <b>62</b> of the cooking container <b>32</b>. This clearance between the blocking wall <b>52</b> and the back wall <b>62</b> defines an air duct <b>74</b> within the cooking container <b>32</b>, separate from the cooking volume, and through which air is circulated during operation of the cooking system <b>20</b>. In an embodiment, a contour of the cooking container <b>32</b> facilitates positioning of the insert <b>50</b> relative to the cooking container <b>32</b>. As previously described, one or more protrusions <b>64</b> extend from a bottom surface of the insert <b>50</b>, and as best shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>4</b> and <b>5</b></figref>, the bottom surface <b>58</b> of the cooking container <b>32</b> may be contoured to define one or more channels <b>68</b> therein. When the insert <b>50</b> is positioned within the cooking container <b>32</b>, the one or more protrusions <b>64</b> are received within the one or more channels <b>68</b>. The engagement between the at least one protrusion <b>64</b> and the sidewalls of the channel(s) <b>68</b> properly positions the insert <b>50</b> within the cooking container <b>32</b> to create a suitably sized air duct <b>74</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0098" num="0097">The cooking system <b>20</b> additionally includes at least one heating element <b>70</b> operable to impart heat to the cooking volume during one or more modes of operation of the cooking system <b>20</b>. In the illustrated, non-limiting embodiment best shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>1</b>, <b>2</b> and <b>4</b>-<b>5</b></figref>, the at least one heating element <b>70</b> is positioned within the internal compartment <b>28</b>, generally at or above an upper extent or surface <b>72</b> of the cooking container <b>32</b>, such as proximate a center of the cooking container <b>32</b> for example. In an embodiment, the heating element <b>70</b> is disposed adjacent a center of the cooking volume and/or the cooking container <b>32</b>. In such embodiments, the at least one heating element <b>70</b> is mounted completely outside of the cooking container <b>32</b>, and vertically offset from the upper extent or surface <b>72</b> thereof. In another embodiment, best shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref>, the at least one heating element <b>70</b> may be located adjacent the rear of the internal compartment <b>28</b>, such as in vertical alignment with the air duct <b>74</b> formed between the blocking wall <b>52</b> of the insert <b>50</b> and the back wall <b>62</b> of the cooking container <b>32</b>. However, it should be understood that a heating element <b>70</b> located at any suitable location is within the scope of the disclosure.</p>
<p id="p-0099" num="0098">The at least one heating element <b>70</b> may be capable of performing any suitable type of heat generation. For example, a heating element <b>70</b> configured to heat one or more food items located within the cooking volume of the cooking container <b>32</b> via conduction, convection, radiation, and induction are all within the scope of the disclosure. In the illustrated, non-limiting embodiment, the heating element <b>70</b> is a convective heating element, and the cooking system <b>20</b> additionally includes an air movement mechanism <b>76</b>, such as a fan for example, operable to circulate air through the cooking volume. The air is heated as it flows along a path of circulation, such as by flowing over a portion of the at least one heating element <b>70</b>. As shown, the air movement mechanism <b>76</b> is located within the internal compartment <b>28</b> at a position entirely above the upper extent <b>72</b> of the cooking container <b>32</b>. In addition, at least a portion of the air movement mechanism <b>76</b>, and in some embodiment, the entirety of the air movement mechanism <b>76</b>, is disposed vertically above the cooking volume, and therefore the insert <b>50</b>. As shown, the air movement mechanism <b>76</b> is horizontally offset from the at least one heating element <b>70</b>. However, embodiments where the air movement mechanism <b>76</b> vertically or horizontally overlaps or is aligned with the at least one heating element <b>70</b> are also contemplated herein.</p>
<p id="p-0100" num="0099">The air movement mechanism <b>76</b>, or at least a portion thereof may be removable from the internal compartment. In the illustrated, non-limiting embodiment, the air movement mechanism <b>76</b> is driven by a motor <b>78</b> located at least partially externally to the internal compartment <b>28</b>. Further, the cooking system <b>20</b> may include a vent <b>80</b> for exhausting hot air generated by operation of at least one of the air movement mechanism <b>76</b> or the motor <b>78</b> to the exterior of the cooking system <b>20</b>. Although the vent <b>80</b> is illustrated as being formed at the rear of the internal compartment <b>28</b>, embodiments where the vent <b>80</b> is formed at another location are also contemplated herein.</p>
<p id="p-0101" num="0100">An example of the air movement mechanism <b>76</b> is illustrated in more detail in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>5</b> and <b>6</b></figref>. In the illustrated, non-limiting embodiment, the air movement mechanism <b>76</b> includes a fan wheel <b>82</b> positioned within a fan housing <b>84</b>. As shown, the fan wheel <b>82</b> is configured to rotate about an axis X oriented generally horizontally, and in some embodiments, the axis of the fan wheel is oriented perpendicular to the translational axis along which the cooking container <b>32</b> is configured to move relative to the housing <b>22</b>. The fan housing <b>84</b> has an outer wall <b>86</b> having a scroll-shaped length, a first sidewall <b>88</b> including a first inlet aperture <b>90</b> and a second sidewall (not shown) including a second inlet aperture. Although the outlet opening <b>92</b> of the fan housing <b>84</b> is illustrated as being generally rectangular in shape, embodiments where the outlet opening <b>92</b> is another shape are also contemplated herein.</p>
<p id="p-0102" num="0101">With specific reference now to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>6</b></figref>, the fan wheel <b>82</b> is typically formed with first wheel portion <b>94</b> and a second wheel portion <b>96</b>. Both the first wheel portion <b>94</b> and the second wheel portion <b>96</b> function as an air inlet and are configured to provide air to a single plenum. The air inlet defined by the first wheel portion <b>94</b> is arranged in a first plane at a first side of the air movement mechanism <b>76</b> and the air inlet defined by the second wheel portion <b>96</b> is arranged in a second plane at a second side of the air movement mechanism <b>76</b>, the first and second planes being generally parallel. Accordingly, the air inlets defined by the first and second wheel portions <b>94</b>, <b>96</b> remain generally fixed relative to both the fan housing <b>84</b> and an axis of rotation of the fan wheel <b>82</b>. The first wheel portion <b>94</b> includes a first plurality of impeller blades <b>98</b> and the second wheel portion <b>96</b> similarly includes a second plurality of impeller blades <b>100</b>. One or both of the first plurality and the second plurality of impeller blades <b>98</b>, <b>100</b> may have a backward curved configuration, a forward curved configuration, or another configuration.</p>
<p id="p-0103" num="0102">With reference now to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>7</b></figref>, a control panel or user interface <b>102</b> may be positioned at an exterior surface of the housing <b>22</b>. The control panel <b>102</b> includes one or more inputs <b>104</b> associated with energizing the heating element <b>70</b> of the cooking system <b>20</b> and for selecting various modes of operation of the cooking system <b>20</b>. One or more of the inputs <b>104</b> may include a light or other indicator to show that the respective input has been selected. The control panel <b>102</b> may additionally include a display <b>106</b> separate from and associated with the at least one input <b>104</b>. However, embodiments where the display <b>106</b> is integrated into the at least one input <b>104</b> are also contemplated herein.</p>
<p id="p-0104" num="0103">Operation of the one or more inputs <b>104</b> will be described in more detail below. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>7</b></figref> illustrates an example of a control system <b>108</b> of the cooking system <b>20</b> including a controller or processor <b>110</b> for controlling operation of the heating element <b>70</b> and air movement device <b>76</b> (including the motor <b>78</b> associated therewith), and in some embodiments for executing stored sequences of heating operation. The processor <b>110</b> is operably coupled to the control panel <b>102</b> and to the heating element <b>70</b> and the air movement mechanism <b>76</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0105" num="0104">In addition, the cooking system <b>20</b> may include one or more sensors S for monitoring one or more parameters associated with the temperature of the heating element <b>70</b>, the cooking volume, the airflow being delivered to the cooking volume and/or and the insert <b>50</b> positioned within the cooking container <b>32</b> during a cooking operation. Accordingly, operation of the cooking system <b>20</b>, and in particular of the one or more heating elements <b>70</b>, may be regulated in response to the parameters sensed by the one or more sensors S. In an embodiment, the one or more sensors S includes a temperature sensor arranged in communication with the processor <b>110</b>. In an embodiment, the temperature sensor(s) S, such as a negative temperature coefficient (NTC) sensor for example, is positioned adjacent the rear of the internal compartment <b>28</b>, upstream from the air duct <b>74</b> defined between the back wall <b>62</b> of the cooking container <b>32</b> and the blocking wall <b>52</b> of the insert <b>50</b>. In embodiments of the cooking system <b>20</b> including one or more temperature sensors S, adjustment of an operating parameter, such as operation of the heating element <b>70</b> for example, may be performed using the control algorithm in response to the temperature of the heated airflow, measured by the temperature sensor S disposed in the heated airflow. For example, power provided to the heating element <b>70</b> may be increased if the sensed airflow temperature is below a set point, and the power provided to the heating element <b>70</b> may be reduced or ceased completely if the sensed airflow temperature is above a set point, thereby allowing the cooking volume to cool.</p>
<p id="p-0106" num="0105">In an embodiment, the air movement mechanism <b>76</b> of the cooking system <b>20</b> is a variable speed fan operable at a plurality of rotational speeds. In an embodiment, the operational speed of the air movement mechanism <b>76</b> may vary based on the cooking mode selected. For example, the speed of the air movement mechanism <b>76</b> during operation in a first cooking mode may be different than the speed of the air movement mechanism <b>76</b> during operation in a second cooking mode. The operational speed of the air movement mechanism <b>76</b> may be controlled by the processor <b>110</b> in response to one or more inputs <b>104</b>, including selection of a cooking mode. However, the processor <b>110</b> may also be configured to adjust the operational speed of the air movement mechanism <b>76</b>, or alternatively, the power supplied to the at least one heating elements <b>70</b> to control the temperature and/or pressure within the interior <b>38</b> of the cooking container <b>32</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0107" num="0106">In an embodiment, at least one input <b>104</b> on the control panel <b>102</b> is an on/off button which allows the user to activate or deactivate the control panel <b>102</b>. When the control panel <b>102</b> is deactivated, the one or more heating elements <b>70</b> are not energized. In an exemplary embodiment, the at least one input <b>104</b> is operable to select one or more manual modes of operation of the heating element <b>70</b>. Alternatively, or in addition, at least one input <b>104</b> is operable to select a stored sequence of operation of the heating element <b>70</b>. In some cases, the stored sequences may be particularly well suited for a given method of food preparation and/or for particular ingredients or types of ingredients. The plurality of stored sequences associated with the at least one input <b>104</b> may be stored within a memory accessible by the processor <b>110</b>. Alternatively, the plurality of stored sequences may be stored remotely from the cooking system <b>20</b>, and may be accessed by the processor <b>110</b>, such as via wireless communication for example.</p>
<p id="p-0108" num="0107">In addition, a user may be able to enter a time associated with operation of the cooking system <b>20</b> in a desired manual mode. The time may be entered via the same input <b>104</b> or a separate input <b>104</b> as used to select a mode of operation. Further in embodiments where the cooking system <b>20</b> is in a mode configured to perform a stored sequence in response to selection of one of the inputs <b>104</b>, the display <b>106</b> may indicate a time remaining. Temperature or other parameters may also be entered via inputs <b>104</b> and/or shown on the display <b>106</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0109" num="0108">The at least one input <b>104</b> may include a distinct start button intended to initiate operation in a desired mode, a distinct stop button to cease all operation, or a stop/start button intended to initiate and cease functions. Alternatively, the cooking system <b>20</b> may be operable to automatically start operation after a predetermined time has elapsed once an input <b>104</b> has been selected and any necessary information has been provided to the control panel <b>102</b>. Alternatively, one or more of the other inputs <b>104</b> may be operable to start and stop operation of the cooking system <b>20</b>, regardless of whether the cooking system <b>20</b> is following a stored sequence or is in a manual mode.</p>
<p id="p-0110" num="0109">As previously noted, the one or more inputs <b>104</b> may be operable to initiate operation of the cooking system <b>20</b> in a plurality of cooking modes. In an embodiment, the cooking system <b>20</b> is operable in a cooking mode where the heating element <b>70</b> is employed to perform a non-contact heating operation, such as a convective or radiative heating operation. Suitable cooking operations that may be performed in this first cooking mode include, but are not limited to air frying, broiling, baking/roasting, and dehydrating.</p>
<p id="p-0111" num="0110">During operation in the first cooking mode, the air movement mechanism <b>76</b> is operable to circulate a heated air flow through the cooking volume. As previously described, the air movement mechanism <b>76</b> is operable to draw air upwards, through the adjacent heating element <b>70</b> and into the two inlets arranged at opposing sides of the fan wheel <b>82</b>. The heated air is expelled outwardly from the outlet opening <b>92</b> of the fan housing <b>84</b> in a single direction. In the illustrated, non-limiting embodiment, the air output from the air movement mechanism <b>76</b> is provided within a plane directed downwardly into the cooking container <b>32</b>. In the illustrated, non-limiting embodiment, the outlet opening <b>92</b> arranged directly adjacent the upper extent <b>72</b> of the cooking container <b>32</b>, such that the air is expelled from the outlet opening <b>92</b> directly into the air duct <b>74</b> formed within the cooking container <b>32</b>. Once the heated air reaches the bottom surface <b>58</b> of the cooking container <b>32</b>, the hot air will be deflected off the bottom surface <b>58</b> towards the cooking volume. Because the bottom surface <b>58</b> of the cooking container <b>32</b> is sloped, the interaction between the heated air and the sloped bottom surface <b>58</b> directs the heated air both forwards and upwardly, causing the air to evenly distribute from the back to the front of the cooking container <b>32</b> before passing through the openings <b>56</b> formed in the food support surface <b>54</b> of the insert <b>50</b>. The hot air is drawn by the air movement mechanism <b>76</b> through the openings <b>56</b> and over the exterior of the food items positioned on the food support surface <b>54</b>. From within the cooking volume, the air is then drawn back into one of the inlets of the air movement mechanism <b>76</b> for further circulation within the interior <b>28</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0112" num="0111">With reference now to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>8</b>-<b>15</b></figref>, in an embodiment of the cooking system <b>20</b>, the housing <b>22</b> includes a plurality of internal compartments arranged within the interior of the housing <b>22</b>. For example, as best shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>8</b>, <b>14</b>, and <b>15</b></figref>, the housing <b>22</b> is illustrated as having a first internal compartment <b>28</b><i>a </i>and a second internal compartment <b>28</b><i>b, </i>separated from one another at least in part by a divider or wall <b>130</b>. The divider <b>130</b> extends vertically from a base of the housing or liner <b>30</b> and forms a sidewall of a bottom portion of two adjacent internal compartments <b>28</b><i>a, </i><b>28</b><i>b. </i>In an embodiment, the divider <b>130</b> extends to a lower edge of an upper portion of each internal compartment <b>28</b><i>a, </i><b>28</b><i>b, </i>the upper portion of each internal compartment containing the respective heating element <b>70</b><i>a, </i><b>70</b><i>b, </i>and air movement mechanism <b>76</b><i>a, </i><b>76</b><i>b </i>associated therewith. As shown, the plurality of internal compartments <b>28</b><i>a, </i><b>28</b><i>b </i>(both the upper and lower portions) are fluidly separate from one another. Although two internal compartments <b>28</b><i>a, </i><b>28</b><i>b </i>are illustrated and described herein, it should be understood that embodiments including any number of internal compartments, such as more than two compartments are also within the scope of the disclosure. The plurality of internal compartments <b>28</b><i>a, </i><b>28</b><i>b </i>may be substantially similar in size and shape, or alternatively, may be different.</p>
<p id="p-0113" num="0112">Each of the internal compartments <b>28</b><i>a, </i><b>28</b><i>b </i>formed in the housing <b>22</b> may be substantially identical to the internal compartment <b>28</b> previously described with respect to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>1</b>-<b>6</b></figref>. More specifically, a respective cooking container <b>32</b><i>a, </i><b>32</b><i>b </i>is insertable into each internal compartment <b>28</b><i>a, </i><b>28</b><i>b, </i>and an insert <b>50</b><i>a, </i><b>50</b><i>b </i>may be removably installed within the interior <b>38</b><i>a, </i><b>38</b><i>b </i>of each cooking container <b>32</b><i>a, </i><b>32</b><i>b. </i>In addition, each internal compartment <b>28</b><i>a, </i><b>28</b><i>b </i>includes at least one heating element <b>70</b><i>a, </i><b>70</b><i>b </i>and an air movement mechanism <b>76</b><i>a, </i><b>76</b><i>b </i>configured to circulate air through the internal compartment <b>28</b><i>a, </i><b>28</b><i>b, </i>respectively. The components associated with operation of each internal compartment, such as the heating element and air movement mechanism are also independently operable and fluidly separate from the components of the adjacent internal compartment.</p>
<p id="p-0114" num="0113">In the non-limiting embodiment of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>14</b> and <b>15</b></figref>, each air movement mechanism <b>76</b><i>a, </i><b>76</b><i>b </i>is illustrated as a fan wheel or impeller <b>82</b> that is configured to rotate about a generally vertically oriented axis. The air movement mechanisms <b>76</b><i>a, </i><b>76</b><i>b </i>need not include a separate housing as previously described with respect to the embodiment of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>1</b>-<b>6</b></figref>. As shown, the air movement mechanisms <b>76</b><i>a, </i><b>76</b><i>b </i>may be stacked vertically relative to the heating element <b>70</b><i>a, </i><b>70</b><i>b </i>such that a flow of air is configured to flow from the heating element <b>70</b><i>a, </i><b>70</b><i>b </i>directly to the air movement mechanism <b>76</b><i>a, </i><b>76</b><i>b </i>sequentially. The axial flow of air provided to the inlet of the air movement mechanism <b>76</b><i>a, </i><b>76</b><i>b </i>is expelled from the impeller <b>82</b><i>a, </i><b>82</b><i>b </i>radially, adjacent the sides of the internal compartment <b>28</b>. Although this configuration of the air movement mechanism <b>76</b><i>a, </i><b>76</b><i>b </i>is illustrated with respect to an embodiment of the cooking system <b>20</b> including a plurality of fluidly distinct internal compartments <b>28</b><i>a, </i><b>28</b><i>b, </i>it should be understood that such an air movement mechanism <b>76</b> may also be used in embodiments of the cooking system <b>20</b> including only a single internal compartment <b>28</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0115" num="0114">As noted above, the cooking system <b>20</b> includes a motor <b>78</b> located external to the internal compartment <b>28</b> and operable to rotate an air movement mechanism <b>76</b> about an axis of rotation X. In embodiments of the cooking system <b>20</b> including two distinct internal compartments, a single motor <b>78</b> may be used to drive both a first air movement mechanism <b>76</b><i>a </i>associated with the first internal compartment <b>28</b><i>a </i>and a second air movement mechanism <b>76</b><i>b </i>associated with the second internal compartment <b>28</b><i>b. </i>In such embodiments, the motor <b>78</b> may be disposed within the housing <b>22</b> between the first and second compartments <b>28</b><i>a, </i><b>28</b><i>b, </i>such that the first air movement mechanism <b>76</b><i>a </i>is mounted to a first output shaft <b>120</b> extending from a first side of the motor <b>78</b> and the second air movement mechanism <b>76</b><i>b </i>is mounted to a second output shaft <b>122</b> extending from a second side of the motor <b>78</b>. As a result, the first air movement mechanism <b>76</b><i>a </i>and the second air movement mechanism <b>76</b><i>b </i>may be positioned coaxially (see <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>10</b></figref>). However, embodiments, where the axis of rotation X<b>1</b> of the first air movement mechanism <b>76</b><i>a </i>is offset from the axis of rotation X<b>2</b> of the second air movement mechanism <b>76</b><i>b </i>are also contemplated herein.</p>
<p id="p-0116" num="0115">Because a single motor <b>78</b> is used to drive the both the first and second air movement mechanisms <b>76</b><i>a, </i><b>76</b><i>b, </i>in an embodiment, both the first and second air movement mechanisms <b>76</b><i>a, </i><b>76</b><i>b </i>are driven about their axes, even when only one of the first and second internal compartment <b>28</b><i>a, </i><b>28</b><i>b </i>is being used to perform a cooking operation. Accordingly, an air movement mechanism <b>76</b> may rotate about its axis even when the adjacent heating mechanism <b>70</b> associated therewith is non-operational. In other embodiments, the first and second air movement mechanisms <b>76</b><i>a, </i><b>76</b><i>b </i>may be independently operable via a shared motor <b>78</b>. Further, in an embodiment, the motor <b>78</b> is operable to rotate the first and second air movement mechanisms <b>76</b><i>a, </i><b>76</b><i>b, </i>at the same speed. However, embodiments where the first and second air movement mechanisms <b>76</b><i>a, </i><b>76</b><i>b, </i>are rotated at different speeds, such as via a coupling for example, are also within the scope of the disclosure.</p>
<p id="p-0117" num="0116">However, it should be understood that embodiments of the cooking system <b>20</b> that include a separate motor associated with each internal compartment are also within the scope of the disclosure. For example, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>15</b></figref>, the system <b>20</b> includes two separate motors <b>78</b><i>a, </i><b>78</b><i>b </i>configured to operate the air movement mechanisms <b>76</b><i>a, </i><b>76</b><i>b </i>associated with the first and second internal compartments <b>28</b><i>a, </i><b>28</b><i>b </i>independently. In such embodiments, each motor <b>78</b><i>a, </i><b>78</b><i>b </i>may be located external to the internal compartment <b>28</b>, for example in a vertically stacked configuration relative to the heating elements <b>70</b><i>a, </i><b>70</b><i>b, </i>and the air movement mechanisms <b>76</b><i>a, </i><b>76</b><i>b. </i>In such embodiments, the motors <b>78</b><i>a, </i><b>78</b><i>b </i>may be located near an upper end or top surface of the housing <b>22</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0118" num="0117">In embodiments of the cooking system <b>20</b> including a plurality of internal compartments, a single control system <b>108</b>, as previously described with respect to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>7</b></figref>, may be suitable to selectively perform one or more cooking operations associated with both the first internal compartment <b>28</b><i>a </i>and the second internal compartment <b>28</b><i>b. </i>Accordingly, the same inputs <b>104</b> may be used to provide control for the plurality of internal compartments <b>28</b><i>a, </i><b>28</b><i>b, </i>or alternatively, distinct inputs <b>104</b> may be associated with each of the plurality of internal compartments <b>28</b><i>a, </i><b>28</b><i>b, </i>respectively.</p>
