<p id="p-0002" num="0001">This application is continuation of U.S. application Ser. No. 16/493,952, filed on Sep. 13, 2019, which is a 371 National Stage entry based on International Application No. PCT/US2017/022651, filed Mar. 16, 2017, the disclosures of which are hereby incorporated by reference in their entirety.</p>

<?summary-of-invention description="Summary of Invention" end="lead"?>
<heading id="h-0002" level="1">FIELD</heading>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">The present disclosure relates to cushioning members incorporating particulate matter and more particularly to cushioning members incorporating particulate matter for use with articles of footwear</p>
<heading id="h-0003" level="1">BACKGROUND</heading>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">This section provides background information related to the present disclosure which is not necessarily prior art.</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">Articles of footwear conventionally include an upper and a sole structure. The upper may be formed from any suitable material(s) to receive, secure, and support a foot on the sole structure. The upper may cooperate with laces, straps, or other fasteners to adjust the fit of the upper around the foot. A bottom portion of the upper, proximate to a bottom surface of the foot, attaches to the sole structure.</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">Sole structures generally include a layered arrangement extending between a ground surface and the upper. One layer of the sole structure includes an outsole that provides abrasion-resistance and traction with the ground surface. The outsole may be formed from rubber or other materials that impart durability and wear-resistance, as well as enhance traction with the ground surface. Another layer of the sole structure includes a midsole disposed between the outsole and the upper. The midsole provides cushioning for the foot and is generally at least partially formed from a polymer foam material that compresses resiliently under an applied load to cushion the foot by attenuating ground-reaction forces. The midsole may define a bottom surface on one side that opposes the outsole and a footbed on the opposite side that may be contoured to conform to a profile of the bottom surface of the foot. Sole structures may also include a comfort-enhancing insole or a sockliner located within a void proximate to the bottom portion of the upper.</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">Midsoles using polymer foam materials are generally configured as a single slab that compresses resiliently under applied loads, such as during walking or running movements. Generally, single-slab polymer foams are designed with an emphasis on balancing cushioning characteristics that relate to softness and responsiveness as the slab compresses under gradient loads. Polymer foams providing cushioning that is too soft will decrease the compressibility and the ability of the midsole to attenuate ground-reaction forces after repeated compressions. Conversely, polymer foams that are too hard and, thus, very responsive, sacrifice softness, thereby resulting in a loss in comfort. While different regions of a slab of polymer foam may vary in density, hardness, energy return, and material selection to balance the softness and responsiveness of the slab as a whole, creating a single slab of polymer foam that loads in a gradient manner from soft to responsive is difficult to achieve.</p>

<p id="p-0045" num="0044">With reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>1</b> and <b>2</b></figref>, an article of footwear <b>10</b> is provided. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>, the article of footwear <b>10</b> includes an upper <b>12</b> and a sole structure <b>14</b> attached to the upper <b>12</b>. The article of footwear <b>10</b> may be divided into one or more portions. The portions may include a forefoot portion <b>16</b>, a midfoot portion <b>18</b>, and a heel portion <b>20</b>. The forefoot portion <b>16</b> may correspond with toes and joints connecting metatarsal bones with phalanx bones of a foot. The midfoot portion <b>18</b> may correspond with an arch area of the foot, and the heel portion <b>20</b> may correspond with rear portions of the foot, including a calcaneus bone.</p>
<p id="p-0046" num="0045">The upper <b>12</b> includes interior surfaces that define an interior void <b>22</b> that receives and secures a foot for support on the sole structure <b>14</b>. An ankle opening <b>24</b> located in the heel portion <b>20</b> may provide access to the interior void <b>22</b>. For example, the ankle opening <b>24</b> may receive a foot to secure the foot within the void <b>22</b> and facilitate entry and removal of the foot from and to the interior void <b>22</b>. In some examples, one or more fasteners <b>26</b> extend along the upper <b>12</b> to adjust a fit of the interior void <b>22</b> around the foot while concurrently accommodating entry and removal of the foot therefrom. The upper <b>12</b> may include apertures <b>28</b> such as eyelets and/or other engagement features such as fabric or mesh loops that receive the fasteners <b>26</b>. The fasteners <b>26</b> may include laces, straps, cords, hook-and-loop, or any other suitable type of fastener.</p>
<p id="p-0047" num="0046">The upper <b>12</b> may additionally include a tongue portion <b>30</b> that extends between the interior void <b>22</b> and the fasteners <b>26</b>. The upper <b>12</b> may be formed from one or more materials that are stitched or adhesively bonded together to form the interior void <b>22</b>. Suitable materials for the upper may include, but are not limited to, textiles, foam, leather, and synthetic leather. The materials may be selected and located to impart properties of durability, air-permeability, wear-resistance, flexibility, and comfort to the foot while disposed within the interior void <b>22</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0048" num="0047">With continued reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>1</b> and <b>2</b></figref>, the sole structure <b>14</b> is shown as including a midsole <b>32</b>, an outsole <b>34</b>, and a cushioning member <b>36</b>. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>2</b> and <b>8</b></figref>, the midsole <b>32</b> is generally disposed between the outsole <b>34</b> and the upper <b>12</b> and supports the cushioning member <b>36</b> relative to the upper <b>12</b>. Namely, the midsole <b>32</b> may support the cushioning member <b>36</b> between the outsole <b>34</b> and a lower substrate <b>38</b> of the upper <b>12</b>. The substrate <b>38</b> may be attached to the upper <b>12</b> via stitching <b>40</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref>) or, alternatively, may be integrally formed with a material of the upper <b>12</b>. For example, if the upper <b>12</b> or a portion of the upper <b>12</b> is formed from a knit material, the knit material may likewise form the substrate <b>38</b> and, as such, the substrate <b>38</b> that opposes the midsole <b>32</b> and the cushioning member <b>36</b> may be integrally formed with the upper <b>12</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0049" num="0048">If the substrate <b>38</b> is separately formed from the upper <b>12</b>, the substrate <b>38</b> may be attached to the upper <b>12</b> via stitching <b>40</b>. Regardless of whether the substrate <b>38</b> is integrally formed with the upper <b>12</b> or, alternatively, is a separate component that is attached to the upper <b>12</b>, the substrate <b>38</b> is disposed generally between the midsole <b>32</b> and the upper <b>12</b> and is formed from a flexible material. Forming the substrate <b>38</b> from a flexible material allows the substrate <b>38</b> to stretch and move when loaded by a user's foot during use. Allowing the substrate <b>38</b> to flex and move in response to a load received by a user's foot during use allows the user's foot to depress the midsole <b>32</b> and/or the cushioning member <b>36</b>, thereby providing the user with a degree of comfort and cushioning during use of the article of footwear <b>10</b>, as will be described in greater detail below.</p>
<p id="p-0050" num="0049">The midsole <b>32</b> may be formed from a polymer material such as, for example, a foamed polymer material. Namely, the foamed polymer material may be ethyl-vinyl-acetate or polyurethane. Regardless of the particular construction of the midsole <b>32</b>, the midsole <b>32</b> extends generally from an anterior end <b>42</b> of the upper <b>12</b> to a posterior end <b>44</b> of the upper <b>12</b>. Further, the midsole <b>32</b> may extend between a medial side <b>46</b> of the upper <b>12</b> and a lateral side <b>48</b> of the upper <b>12</b>. In so doing, a portion of the midsole <b>32</b> may extend onto an outer surface <b>50</b> of the upper <b>12</b> proximate to a junction of the upper <b>12</b> and the midsole <b>32</b>. For example, the midsole <b>32</b> may include a projection <b>52</b> that extends at least partially around a perimeter of the midsole <b>32</b> and extends from the midsole <b>32</b> to cover a portion of the outer surface <b>50</b> of the upper <b>12</b>.

The cavities <b>54</b>, <b>56</b>, <b>58</b> are formed in a first surface <b>60</b> of the midsole <b>32</b> that opposes the substrate <b>38</b> of the upper <b>12</b>. The first surface <b>60</b> is recessed from an upper surface <b>62</b> of the midsole <b>32</b> to provide clearance for a portion of the cushioning member <b>36</b> when the cushioning member <b>36</b> is disposed within the midsole <b>32</b>, as will be described in greater detail below.</p>
<p id="p-0052" num="0051">The midsole <b>32</b> additionally includes a second surface <b>64</b> located on an opposite side of the midsole <b>32</b> than the first surface <b>60</b>. The second surface <b>64</b> opposes the outsole <b>34</b> and provides a surface to which the outsole <b>34</b> may be attached.</p>
<p id="p-0053" num="0052">The cavities <b>54</b>, <b>56</b>, <b>58</b> are each associated with a first aperture and a second aperture of the midsole <b>32</b> that permit insertion of the cushioning member <b>36</b> into the midsole <b>32</b> and visibility of the cushioning member <b>36</b> at the outsole <b>34</b>, respectively, once the cushioning member <b>36</b> is inserted into the midsole <b>32</b>. Specifically, the first cavity <b>54</b> defines a first aperture <b>66</b> at a junction of the first cavity <b>54</b> and the first surface <b>60</b>. The first aperture <b>66</b> defines an opening to the first cavity <b>54</b> at the first surface <b>60</b> and generally defines a shape of the first cavity <b>54</b> at the first surface <b>60</b>. The first cavity <b>54</b> additionally includes a second aperture <b>68</b> disposed at an opposite end of the first cavity <b>54</b> than the first aperture <b>66</b> and formed through a bottom wall <b>70</b> of the midsole <b>32</b> within the first cavity <b>54</b>. In one configuration, the bottom wall <b>70</b> and, thus, the second aperture <b>68</b> may extend in a plane that is substantially parallel to a plane defined by the first surface <b>60</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0054" num="0053">As described, the opening to the first cavity <b>54</b> at the first surface <b>60</b> is generally defined by the shape and size of the first aperture <b>66</b> and, further, a bottom portion of the first cavity <b>54</b> disposed at an opposite end of the first cavity <b>54</b> than the first aperture <b>66</b> is generally defined by the bottom wall <b>70</b>. The first cavity <b>54</b> is further defined by a series of side surfaces <b>72</b> that extend from the bottom wall <b>70</b> to a junction of the first aperture <b>66</b> and the first surface <b>60</b> around a perimeter of the first cavity <b>54</b>. Accordingly, the side surfaces <b>72</b> cooperate with one another to encircle and define a shape of the first cavity <b>54</b> between the bottom wall <b>70</b> and the first aperture <b>66</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0055" num="0054">The second cavity <b>56</b> is disposed generally between the first cavity <b>54</b> and the third cavity <b>58</b> along a longitudinal access (L) of the sole structure <b>14</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>9</b></figref>). The second cavity <b>56</b> includes a first aperture <b>74</b> that defines an opening to the second cavity <b>56</b> at the first surface <b>60</b>. The second cavity <b>56</b> further includes a second aperture <b>76</b> disposed at an opposite end of the second cavity <b>56</b> than the first aperture <b>74</b> and formed through a bottom wall <b>78</b> of the midsole <b>32</b>. As with the bottom wall <b>70</b> associated with the first cavity <b>54</b>, the bottom wall <b>78</b> associated with the second cavity <b>56</b> defines a bottom of the second cavity <b>56</b> and, thus, defines a bottom surface of the second cavity <b>56</b>. Side surfaces <b>80</b> extend between the first aperture <b>74</b> and the bottom wall <b>78</b> to define the overall shape of the second cavity <b>56</b>. As such, the side surfaces <b>80</b> cooperate with the bottom wall <b>78</b> to define the overall shape of the second cavity <b>56</b> between the first aperture <b>74</b> and the bottom wall <b>78</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0056" num="0055">The third cavity <b>56</b> is disposed closer to the posterior end <b>44</b> than the first cavity <b>54</b> and the second cavity <b>56</b> and includes a first aperture <b>82</b> formed in the first surface <b>60</b> of the midsole <b>32</b>.

Accordingly, a first wall <b>90</b> of the midsole <b>32</b> may extend between the first cavity <b>54</b> and the second cavity <b>56</b> and a second wall <b>92</b> may extend between the second cavity <b>56</b> and the third cavity <b>58</b>. Accordingly, the first wall <b>90</b> may serve to separate the first cavity <b>54</b> from the second cavity <b>56</b> while the second wall <b>92</b> serves to separate the second cavity <b>56</b> from the third cavity <b>58</b> in a direction extending along the longitudinal access (L) of the sole structure <b>14</b>. As will be described in greater detail below, the walls <b>90</b>, <b>92</b> help to maintain a desired position of the cushioning member <b>36</b> relative to the midsole <b>32</b> and, thus, help to provide a desired cushioning effect to a foot of a user during use of the article of footwear <b>10</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0059" num="0058">With particular reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>2</b>-<b>8</b></figref>, the cushioning member <b>36</b> is shown as including a first barrier member <b>94</b>, a second barrier member <b>96</b>, and a quantity of particulate matter <b>98</b> contained within the cushioning member <b>36</b>. In one configuration, the second barrier member <b>96</b> is attached to the first barrier member <b>94</b> to contain the particulate matter <b>98</b> generally between the second barrier member <b>96</b> and the first barrier member <b>94</b>.

In one configuration, the first barrier member <b>94</b> and the second barrier member <b>96</b> are formed from different materials. For example, the first barrier member <b>94</b> may be formed from a polymer material such as thermoplastic polyurethane (TPU). Forming the first barrier member <b>94</b> from TPU allows the first barrier member <b>94</b> to be formed from an impermeable material and, in some configurations, allows the first barrier member <b>94</b> to be formed from an optically clear and/or translucent material.</p>
<p id="p-0061" num="0060">The second barrier member <b>96</b> may be formed from a flexible material such as, for example, spandex. Forming the second barrier member <b>96</b> from a flexible material such as spandex also allows the second barrier member <b>96</b> to be permeable.

<p id="p-0062" num="0061">The second barrier member <b>96</b> may be attached to the first barrier member <b>94</b> via an adhesive <b>106</b>. The adhesive <b>106</b> may be a hot melt adhesive and may surround a perimeter of each of the first compartment <b>100</b>, the second compartment <b>102</b>, and the third compartment <b>104</b>. As such, the adhesive <b>106</b> joins the material of the second barrier member <b>96</b> to the material of the first barrier member <b>94</b> between each of the compartments <b>100</b>, <b>102</b>, <b>104</b>, thereby defining an interior void within each compartment <b>100</b>, <b>102</b>, <b>104</b> between the second barrier member <b>96</b> and the first barrier member <b>94</b>.</p>

Accordingly, when the cushioning member <b>36</b> is inserted into the midsole, an outer surface <b>110</b> of the cushioning member <b>36</b> is substantially flush with the upper surface <b>62</b> of the midsole <b>32</b>, thereby providing a uniform surface that receives the substrate <b>38</b>. Providing a uniform surface that opposes the substrate <b>38</b> provides a degree of comfort to a foot of a user by preventing the user from feeling a transition or junction between the midsole <b>32</b> and the cushioning member <b>36</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0064" num="0063">With particular reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>3</b> and <b>4</b></figref>, the cushioning member <b>36</b> is shown as including varying amounts of particulate matter <b>98</b> disposed within the compartments <b>100</b>, <b>102</b>, <b>104</b>. For example, and with reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref>, the first compartment <b>100</b>, the second compartment <b>102</b>, and the third compartment <b>104</b> are each shown as including different amounts of the particulate matter <b>98</b>. Namely, the first compartment <b>100</b> disposed with the first cavity <b>54</b> and, thus, the forefoot portion <b>16</b> of the sole structure <b>14</b>, includes less particulate matter <b>98</b> than the second compartment <b>102</b> and the third compartment <b>104</b>. Conversely, the third compartment <b>104</b> received by the third cavity <b>58</b> of the midsole <b>32</b> and, thus, located in the heel portion <b>20</b> of the sole structure <b>14</b> receives a greater amount of particulate matter <b>98</b> than the second compartment <b>102</b> and the first compartment <b>100</b>. While the compartments <b>100</b>, <b>102</b>, <b>104</b> are described and shown as receiving different amounts of particulate matter <b>98</b>, each compartment <b>100</b>, <b>102</b>, <b>104</b> may receive approximately the same amount of particulate matter <b>98</b>. Further, and with particular reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b></figref>, one or more of the compartments <b>100</b>, <b>102</b>, <b>104</b> may receive a volume of particulate matter <b>98</b> that creates a bulge <b>112</b> in the outer surface <b>110</b> of the cushioning member <b>36</b>. For example, the second compartment <b>102</b> and the third compartment <b>104</b> of the cushioning member <b>36</b> shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b></figref> each include a bulge <b>112</b> that extends from a nominal plane defined by the second barrier member <b>96</b> at a location of the second compartment <b>102</b> and the third compartment <b>104</b>. Namely, the bulges <b>112</b> extend from a nominal plane defined by the web member <b>108</b> and may be formed by overfilling one or more of the compartments <b>100</b>, <b>102</b>, <b>104</b> with particulate matter <b>98</b>. In one configuration each of the compartments <b>100</b>, <b>102</b>, <b>104</b> is overfilled, thereby creating a bulge <b>112</b> in the outer surface <b>110</b> at each compartment <b>100</b>, <b>102</b>, <b>104</b>. For example, the forward most compartment <b>100</b> may be overfilled by approximately 5-10%, the middle compartment <b>102</b> may be overfilled by approximately 15-20%, and the rearward most compartment <b>104</b> may be overfilled by approximately 25-30%.</p>
<p id="p-0065" num="0064">Overfilling the compartments <b>100</b>, <b>102</b>, <b>104</b> may be accomplished by providing an amount of particulate matter <b>98</b> that would otherwise not fit within the compartments <b>100</b>, <b>102</b>, <b>104</b> which, in turn, creates the bulge <b>112</b> in the outer surface <b>110</b>. In other words, the volume of the overfilled particulate matter <b>98</b> is more than would otherwise fit within each compartment <b>100</b>, <b>102</b>, <b>104</b> absent the second barrier member <b>96</b>. By way of example, if the compartment <b>104</b> includes a volume that can contain 100 discrete pieces of particulate matter <b>98</b>, providing the compartment <b>104</b> with 30% more particulate matter <b>98</b> results in providing the compartment <b>104</b> with <b>130</b> discrete pieces of particulate matter <b>98</b> (i.e., 100 plus 30% or 30 additional discrete pieces of particulate matter <b>98</b>). These additional 30 discrete pieces of particulate matter <b>98</b> are held in position relative to the compartment <b>104</b> by the second barrier member <b>96</b> and, in turn, form the bulge at the outer surface <b>110</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0066" num="0065">Regardless of the amount of particulate matter <b>98</b> disposed within the respective compartments <b>100</b>, <b>102</b>, <b>104</b>, the particulate matter <b>98</b> may be used to enhance the functionality and cushioning characteristics that the material of the midsole <b>32</b> provides. For example, the particulate matter <b>98</b> contained within the compartments <b>100</b>, <b>102</b>, <b>104</b> may include foam beads having a substantially spherical shape and/or a substantially oval shape (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>7</b></figref>). Further, the foam beads defining the particulate matter <b>98</b> may have approximately the same size and shape or, alternatively, may have at least one of a different size and shape. For example, the compartments <b>100</b>, <b>102</b>, <b>104</b> may each include particulate matter <b>98</b> having a different size, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b></figref>, whereby the particulate matter <b>98</b> decreases in size (i.e., a different diameter in the example provided) from compartment <b>104</b> to compartment <b>100</b>. Alternatively, the middle compartment <b>102</b> may include a mixture of different-sized particulate matter <b>98</b> while the other two compartments <b>100</b>, <b>104</b> include same-sized particulate matter <b>98</b>. In the example provided, the other two compartments <b>100</b>, <b>104</b> include same-sized particulate matter <b>98</b> within each compartment <b>100</b>, <b>104</b> but have different-sized particulate matter <b>98</b> relative to one another. While the compartments <b>100</b>, <b>104</b> are shown as including different-sized particulate matter <b>98</b> (i.e., the particulate matter <b>98</b> disposed within compartment (<b>100</b>) is smaller (i.e., in diameter) than the particulate matter <b>98</b> disposed within compartment (<b>104</b>)), the compartments <b>100</b>, <b>104</b> could alternatively include same-sized particulate matter <b>98</b>. Regardless of the particular size and shape of the particulate matter <b>98</b>, the particulate matter <b>98</b> cooperates with the outsole <b>34</b> and the midsole <b>32</b> to provide the article of footwear <b>10</b> with a cushioned and responsive performance during use.</p>
<p id="p-0067" num="0066">The cushioning member <b>36</b> may be inserted into the midsole <b>32</b> such that the first compartment <b>100</b> is received by the first cavity <b>54</b>, the second compartment <b>102</b> is received by the second cavity <b>56</b>, and the third compartment <b>104</b> is received by the third cavity <b>58</b>. Once the cushioning member <b>36</b> is disposed within the midsole <b>32</b>, the surface <b>110</b> of the cushioning member <b>36</b> is substantially flush with the upper surface <b>62</b> of the midsole <b>32</b> at the web member <b>108</b> that defines a perimeter of the cushioning member <b>36</b>. As such, the second barrier member <b>96</b> cooperates with the material of the midsole <b>32</b> at the upper surface <b>62</b> of the midsole <b>32</b> to provide a generally uniform surface against which the substrate <b>38</b> resides when the sole structure <b>14</b> is attached to the upper <b>12</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0068" num="0067">The outsole <b>34</b> may be formed from a transparent or translucent material and may include one or more discreet portions that are separate from one another. The outsole <b>34</b> may be formed from a durable material such as, for example, rubber and may be attached to the second surface <b>64</b> of the midsole <b>32</b>. The individual portions of the outsole <b>34</b> may be attached to the second surface <b>64</b> of the midsole <b>32</b> proximate to the second apertures <b>68</b>, <b>76</b>, <b>84</b>, respectively associated with the first cavity <b>54</b>, the second cavity <b>56</b>, and the third cavity <b>58</b>. The portions of the outsole <b>34</b> may be separated from one another along a length of the sole structure <b>14</b> in a direction substantially parallel to the longitudinal axis (L). While the outsole <b>34</b> is described and shown as including individual portions that are spaced apart from one another, the outsole <b>34</b> could alternatively have a unitary construction that extends generally across the entire second surface <b>64</b> of the midsole <b>32</b> such that the outsole <b>34</b> extends continuously between the anterior end <b>42</b> and the posterior end <b>44</b> and between the medial side <b>46</b> and the lateral side <b>48</b>. Regardless of the particular construction of the outsole <b>34</b> (i.e., unitary or discrete portions), the outsole <b>34</b> may include treads <b>35</b> that extend from the outsole <b>34</b> to provide increased traction with a ground surface during use of the article of footwear <b>10</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0069" num="0068">Forming the outsole <b>34</b> from a transparent or translucent material allows the cavities <b>54</b>, <b>56</b>, <b>58</b> to be viewed from the outsole <b>34</b> when the outsole <b>34</b> is attached to the midsole <b>32</b> at the second surface <b>64</b>. Further, because the compartments <b>100</b>, <b>102</b>, <b>104</b> substantially fill the respective cavities <b>54</b>, <b>56</b>, <b>58</b> of the midsole <b>32</b>, the compartments <b>100</b>, <b>102</b>, <b>104</b> and, thus, the particulate matter <b>98</b> disposed therein is likewise visible at the second apertures <b>68</b>, <b>76</b>, <b>84</b> of the midsole <b>32</b> through the material of the outsole <b>34</b>. Accordingly, the particulate matter <b>98</b> residing within the respective compartments <b>100</b>, <b>102</b>, <b>104</b> of the cushioning member <b>36</b> is visible through the outsole <b>34</b> at the second apertures <b>68</b>, <b>76</b>, <b>84</b> associated with the respective cavities <b>54</b>, <b>56</b>, <b>58</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0070" num="0069">The sole structure <b>14</b> may be attached to the upper <b>12</b> via a suitable adhesive <b>114</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>10</b></figref>). For example, the adhesive <b>114</b> may extend between and attach the projection <b>52</b> of the midsole <b>32</b> to the outer surface <b>50</b> of the upper <b>12</b>. Further, the adhesive <b>114</b> may attach the web member <b>108</b> of the cushioning member <b>36</b> to the midsole <b>32</b> at a junction of the web member <b>108</b> and the first surface <b>60</b> of the midsole <b>32</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0071" num="0070">During use, a force may be exerted on the midsole <b>32</b> and the cushioning member <b>36</b> at the substrate <b>38</b> when a user's foot is disposed within the interior void <b>22</b> of the upper <b>12</b>. A downward force, for example, may displace the particulate matter <b>98</b> disposed within the respective compartments <b>100</b>, <b>102</b>, <b>104</b> and, further, may compress a material of the midsole <b>32</b>. In so doing, the particulate matter <b>98</b> and, thus, the material of the midsole <b>32</b> provides a degree of cushioning to the foot of the user. The shape of the midsole <b>32</b> at the cavities <b>54</b>, <b>56</b>, <b>58</b> along with the relatively flexible material of the first barrier member <b>94</b> and the second barrier member <b>96</b> allows the material of the barrier members <b>94</b>, <b>96</b> to flex as the particulate matter <b>98</b> moves relative to and within the respective compartments <b>100</b>, <b>102</b>, <b>104</b>. Further, providing the midsole <b>32</b> with the walls <b>90</b>, <b>92</b> that generally separate the compartments <b>100</b>, <b>102</b>, <b>104</b> not only provides a degree of cushioning when the walls <b>90</b>, <b>92</b> are compressed but, additionally, serves to maintain a desired shape of the compartments <b>100</b>, <b>102</b>, <b>104</b>, thereby preventing expansion of the compartments <b>100</b>, <b>102</b>, <b>104</b> beyond a predetermined amount.</p>
<p id="p-0072" num="0071">With reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>11</b>-<b>14</b></figref>, an article of footwear <b>10</b><i>a </i>is provided and includes an upper <b>12</b> and a sole structure <b>14</b><i>a </i>attached to the upper <b>12</b>.

<p id="p-0073" num="0072">The sole structure <b>14</b><i>a </i>is identical to the sole structure <b>14</b> associated with the article of footwear <b>10</b> with the exception of the midsole <b>32</b><i>a. </i>Namely, the midsole <b>32</b><i>a </i>of the sole structure <b>14</b><i>a </i>includes a first wall <b>90</b><i>a </i>having a reduced height relative to the first wall <b>90</b> of the midsole <b>32</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0074" num="0073">With particular reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>13</b></figref>, the reduced height of the first wall <b>90</b> of the midsole <b>32</b><i>a </i>relative to the first wall <b>90</b> of the midsole <b>32</b> results in a gap <b>116</b> being disposed between a distal end <b>118</b> of the first wall <b>90</b><i>a </i>and a lower surface <b>120</b> of the first barrier member <b>94</b> at the web member <b>108</b>. Accordingly, the distal end <b>118</b> of the first wall <b>90</b><i>a </i>opposes the surface <b>120</b> of the first barrier member <b>94</b> at the web member <b>108</b> and is spaced apart and separated from the surface <b>120</b> when the article of footwear <b>10</b><i>a </i>is in a relaxed state (i.e., when a force of a predetermined magnitude is not applied to the sole structure <b>14</b><i>a </i>at the substrate <b>38</b>).</p>
<p id="p-0075" num="0074">When a force of a predetermined magnitude is applied to the sole structure <b>14</b><i>a </i>at the substrate <b>38</b>, the cushioning member <b>36</b> at the first barrier member <b>94</b> and the second barrier member <b>96</b> is displaced, thereby causing the surface <b>120</b> of the first barrier member <b>94</b> to move toward the distal end <b>118</b> of the first wall <b>90</b><i>a. </i>In so doing, the gap <b>116</b> is reduced until the surface <b>120</b> of the first barrier member <b>94</b> contacts the distal end <b>118</b> of the first wall <b>90</b><i>a. </i></p>
<p id="p-0076" num="0075">When the surface <b>120</b> of the first barrier member <b>94</b> contacts the distal end <b>118</b> of the first wall <b>90</b>, the force applied to the substrate <b>38</b> and to the cushioning member <b>36</b> is transmitted to the midsole <b>32</b><i>a </i>at the first wall <b>90</b><i>a. </i>The force received by the first wall <b>90</b><i>a </i>causes compression of the material of the midsole <b>32</b><i>a </i>at the first wall <b>90</b><i>a, </i>thereby allowing the material of the midsole <b>32</b><i>a </i>at the first wall <b>90</b><i>a </i>to absorb the applied force along with the cushioning member <b>36</b> and the remainder of the midsole <b>32</b><i>a. </i></p>
<p id="p-0077" num="0076">Relative to the sole structure <b>14</b> of the article of footwear <b>10</b>, the sole structure <b>14</b><i>a </i>of the article footwear <b>10</b><i>a </i>similarly provides a user with a degree of cushioning and comfort during use of the article footwear <b>10</b><i>a. </i>However, providing the gap <b>116</b> between the first wall <b>90</b><i>a </i>and the web member <b>108</b> of the cushioning member <b>36</b> in the sole structure <b>14</b><i>a, </i>provides for additional deflection of the cushioning member <b>36</b> relative to the amount of deflection of the cushioning member <b>36</b> of the sole structure <b>14</b> when subjected to the same load. Permitting additional deflection of the cushioning member <b>36</b> allows a user to more deeply engage the particulate matter <b>98</b> disposed within the first compartment <b>100</b> and the second compartment <b>102</b> of the cushioning member <b>36</b>. For example, because the cushioning member <b>36</b> is permitted to close the gap <b>116</b> without having to compress the material of the midsole <b>32</b><i>a </i>at the first wall <b>90</b><i>a, </i>deflection of the cushioning member <b>36</b> in a direction toward the midsole <b>32</b><i>a </i>requires less force, as the material of the midsole <b>32</b><i>a </i>does not inhibit such movement at the location of the first wall <b>90</b><i>a </i>until the surface <b>120</b> of the first barrier member <b>94</b> contacts the surface <b>118</b> of the first wall <b>90</b>. Accordingly, a user's foot may more easily engage the particulate matter <b>98</b> disposed within the first compartment <b>100</b> and the second compartment <b>102</b>, thereby allowing the user's foot to engage the particulate matter <b>98</b> within the first compartment <b>100</b> and the second compartment <b>102</b> to a greater extent than a user's foot would engage the particulate matter <b>98</b> of the first compartment <b>100</b> and the second compartment <b>102</b> of the sole structure <b>14</b> at a given applied load.</p>
<p id="p-0078" num="0077">Regardless of the particular sole structure <b>14</b>, <b>14</b><i>a, </i>incorporation of the cushioning member <b>36</b> into the article footwear <b>10</b>, <b>10</b><i>a </i>provides a degree of comfort and cushioning to a foot of a user during use. For example, and as described above, the substrate <b>38</b> and the second barrier member <b>96</b> of the cushioning member <b>36</b> are formed from flexible materials. Accordingly, when a force is applied on the substrate <b>38</b> during use of the article footwear by a foot of a user, the force causes the substrate <b>38</b> and the material of the second barrier member <b>96</b> to flex and stretch, thereby allowing the foot of the user to engage and displace the particulate matter <b>98</b> disposed within the compartments <b>100</b>, <b>102</b>, <b>104</b>. In so doing, the particulate matter <b>98</b> exerts a force on the material of the first barrier member <b>94</b>, thereby causing the first barrier member <b>94</b> to likewise flex and stretch. Such movement of the first barrier member <b>94</b> compresses a material of the midsole <b>32</b>, <b>32</b><i>a </i>generally surrounding the compartments <b>100</b>, <b>102</b>, <b>104</b> which, in turn, absorbs forces associated with a walking or running movement.</p>
<p id="p-0079" num="0078">Flexing and stretching of the materials of the substrate <b>38</b>, the first barrier member <b>94</b>, and the second barrier <b>96</b> along with compression of the material of the midsole <b>32</b>, <b>32</b><i>a </i>provides a degree of cushioning and comfort to a user while wearing the article of footwear <b>10</b>, <b>10</b><i>a. </i>Further, interaction between a foot of a user with the particulate matter <b>98</b>&#x2014;permitted by the generally flexible nature of the material of the substrate <b>38</b> and the second barrier member <b>96</b>&#x2014;likewise provides cushioning to the foot of the user. Further, because of the particulate matter <b>98</b> is permitted to move relative to and within each compartment <b>100</b>, <b>102</b>, <b>104</b>, the particulate matter <b>98</b> conforms to a shape of the user's foot and, thus, provides a degree of tailored cushioning that is specific to the shape of the user's foot. Further yet, because the particulate matter <b>98</b> is permitted to move relative to and within the first compartment <b>100</b>, the second compartment <b>102</b>, and the third compartment <b>104</b>, the shape of the substrate <b>38</b> and the second barrier member <b>96</b> is dynamic and is largely based on the applied loads at the substrate <b>38</b> at any given time. In other words, the support provided by the particulate matter <b>98</b> disposed within the compartments <b>100</b>, <b>102</b>, <b>104</b> moves and shifts in response to the applied forces at the substrate <b>38</b>. In so doing, the effective shape of the substrate <b>38</b> and the second barrier member <b>96</b> is constantly changing as the user applies forces at different locations of the substrate <b>38</b>, thereby causing the particulate matter <b>98</b> to shift and move relative to within the compartments <b>100</b>, <b>102</b>, <b>104</b>. As such, the cushioning member <b>36</b> provides the sole structure <b>14</b>, <b>14</b><i>a </i>and, thus, the article of footwear <b>10</b>, <b>10</b><i>a </i>with cushioning and support that dynamically responds to an applied force and automatically conforms to a shape of the user's foot, thereby providing the user with a tailored and personal cushioning system.</p>
