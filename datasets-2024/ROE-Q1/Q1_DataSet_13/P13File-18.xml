<?summary-of-invention description="Summary of Invention" end="lead"?>
<heading id="h-0001" level="1">TECHNICAL FIELD</heading>
<p id="p-0002" num="0001">The present disclosure relates to endoscope accessories, and more particularly to bronchoscope accessories. The devices described herein find use in a variety of endoscopy (e.g., bronchoscopy) applications.</p>
<heading id="h-0002" level="1">BACKGROUND</heading>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">Precise placement of catheters, probes, and other tools is important in many medical procedures. For example, precise placement of an ablation probe is important for transbronchial lung ablation or local drug delivery. Robotic systems can help with precision placement but are often cost prohibitive. Medical procedures with conventional endoscopic systems involve several devices and a single user has difficulty holding and manipulating all the devices in the conventional system.</p>
<heading id="h-0003" level="1">SUMMARY</heading>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">The disclosure provides, in one aspect, a bronchoscope attachment including a mount with a port, and a cradle defining an insertion axis. The insertion axis is aligned with the port. The bronchoscope attachment further includes a linkage positioned between the mount and the cradle. The linkage is movable between a first position in which the cradle is positioned a first distance from the port and the insertion axis is aligned with the port; and a second position in which the cradle is positioned a second distance from the port and the insertion axis is aligned with the port.</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">In some embodiments, the insertion axis remains aligned with the port in response to movement of the linkage.</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">In some embodiments, the linkage includes a first arm, a second arm, and an elbow coupled between the first arm and the second arm.</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">In some embodiments, a first end of the first arm is pivotably coupled to the mount, and a second end of the first arm is pivotably coupled to the elbow.</p>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">In some embodiments, a first end of the second arm is coupled to the cradle, and a second end of the second arm is pivotably coupled to the elbow.</p>
<p id="p-0009" num="0008">In some embodiments, the elbow includes a first gear coupled to the first arm and a second gear coupled to the second arm.</p>
<p id="p-0010" num="0009">In some embodiments, the first gear is enmeshed with the second gear.</p>
<p id="p-0011" num="0010">In some embodiments, the first arm includes a first link and a second link, and the second arm includes a third link and a fourth link.</p>
<p id="p-0012" num="0011">In some embodiments, the second link and the third link are rotatably coupled together by a gear set positioned in the elbow.</p>
<p id="p-0013" num="0012">In some embodiments, the second arm moves in response to movement of the first arm and the first arm moves in response to movement of the second arm.</p>
<p id="p-0014" num="0013">In some embodiments, the linkage is a telescopic slide.</p>
<p id="p-0015" num="0014">In some embodiments, the mount includes a base portion, a door, and a latch.</p>
<p id="p-0016" num="0015">In some embodiments, the mount includes a first opening partially defined by the door and a second opening at least partially defined by the door, wherein the first opening is aligned with the second opening.</p>
<p id="p-0017" num="0016">In some embodiments, the port is formed in the base portion.</p>
<p id="p-0018" num="0017">In some embodiments, the door is movable with respect to the base portion between an open position and a closed position.</p>
<p id="p-0019" num="0018">In some embodiments, the cradle remains in place in response to the door moving to the open position.</p>
<p id="p-0020" num="0019">In some embodiments, the latch is actuated to lock the door in the closed position.</p>
<p id="p-0021" num="0020">In some embodiments, the bronchoscope attachment further includes a seal coupled to the port.</p>
<p id="p-0022" num="0021">In some embodiments, the mount is rotatable with respect to a bronchoscope.</p>
<p id="p-0023" num="0022">In some embodiments, the port remains in position as the mount rotates about the port.</p>
<p id="p-0024" num="0023">The disclosure provides, in one aspect, a steerable sheath including a handle with a housing, a port formed on the housing, and a user input wheel rotatably coupled to the housing. The steerable sheath further includes a sheath extending from the handle. The sheath includes a proximal end coupled to the handle and a distal end. The steerable sheath includes a transmission coupled between the user input wheel and the distal end of the sheath, and actuation of the user input wheel articulates the distal end of the sheath.</p>
<p id="p-0025" num="0024">In some embodiments, the distal end is curved at an angle with the user input wheel in a neutral position.</p>
<p id="p-0026" num="0025">In some embodiments, the steerable sheath further includes a detent positioned within the housing. The detent engages the transmission with the user input wheel in the neutral position.</p>
<p id="p-0027" num="0026">In some embodiments, the angle is 70&#xb0;.</p>
<p id="p-0028" num="0027">In some embodiments, the user input wheel includes a first indicator visible when the user input wheel is in the neutral position and a second indicator visible when the user input wheel is in a non-neutral position.</p>
<p id="p-0029" num="0028">In some embodiments, the steerable sheath further includes a braking assembly that adjusts the amount of frictional engagement between the housing and the user input wheel.</p>
<p id="p-0030" num="0029">In some embodiments, the user input wheel includes a hub positioned around a boss formed on the housing, and the braking assembly includes a sleeve positioned around the boss.

<p id="p-0089" num="0088">Before any embodiments are explained in detail, it is to be understood that the invention is not limited in its application to the details of construction and the arrangement of components set forth in the following description or illustrated in the following drawings. The invention is capable of other embodiments and of being practiced or of being carried out in various ways.</p>
<heading id="h-0005" level="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION</heading>
<p id="p-0090" num="0089">Unless otherwise defined, all technical and scientific terms used herein have the same meaning as commonly understood by one of ordinary skill in the art. In case of conflict, the present document, including definitions, will control. Preferred methods and materials are described below, although methods and materials similar or equivalent to those described herein can be used in practice or testing of the present disclosure. All publications, patent applications, patents and other references mentioned herein are incorporated by reference in their entirety. The materials, methods, and examples disclosed herein are illustrative only and not intended to be limiting.</p>
<p id="p-0091" num="0090">The terms &#x201c;comprise(s),&#x201d; &#x201c;include(s),&#x201d; &#x201c;having,&#x201d; &#x201c;has,&#x201d; &#x201c;can,&#x201d; &#x201c;contain(s),&#x201d; and variants thereof, as used herein, are intended to be open-ended transitional phrases, terms, or words that do not preclude the possibility of additional acts or structures. The singular forms &#x201c;a,&#x201d; &#x201c;an&#x201d; and &#x201c;the&#x201d; include plural references unless the context clearly dictates otherwise. The present disclosure also contemplates other embodiments &#x201c;comprising,&#x201d; &#x201c;consisting of&#x201d; and &#x201c;consisting essentially of,&#x201d; the embodiments or elements presented herein, whether explicitly set forth or not.</p>
<p id="p-0092" num="0091">For the recitation of numeric ranges herein, each intervening number there between with the same degree of precision is explicitly contemplated. For example, for the range of 6-9, the numbers 7 and 8 are contemplated in addition to 6 and 9, and for the range 6.0-7.0, the number 6.0, 6.1, 6.2, 6.3, 6.4, 6.5, 6.6, 6.7, 6.8, 6.9, and 7.0 are explicitly contemplated.</p>
<p id="p-0093" num="0092">&#x201c;Coupled&#x201d; as used herein refers to two or more components that are secured, by any suitable means, together. Accordingly, in some embodiments, the statement that two or more parts or components are &#x201c;coupled&#x201d; shall mean that the parts are joined or operate together either directly or indirectly, e.g., through one or more intermediate parts or components.</p>
<p id="p-0094" num="0093">&#x201c;Removably coupled&#x201d; as used herein means that one component is coupled with another component in an essentially temporary manner. That is, the two components are coupled in such a way that the joining or separation of the components is easy and does not damage the components. Accordingly, &#x201c;removably coupled&#x201d; components may be readily uncoupled and recoupled without damage to the components.</p>
<p id="p-0095" num="0094">&#x201c;Operatively coupled&#x201d; as used herein means that a number of elements or assemblies, each of which is movable between a first position and a second position, or a first configuration and a second configuration, are coupled so that as the first element moves from one position/configuration to the other, the second element moves between positions/configurations as well. It is noted that a first element may be &#x201c;operatively coupled&#x201d; to another without the opposite being true.</p>
<p id="p-0096" num="0095">Therapeutic endoscopy or interventional endoscopy pertains to an endoscopic procedure during which a treatment (e.g., tissue ablation) (e.g., tissue collection) is carried out via the endoscope. This contrasts with diagnostic endoscopy, where the aim of the procedure is purely to visualize an internal part of a body (e.g., gastrointestinal region, respiratory region, urinary tract region, etc.) in order to aid diagnosis. In practice, a procedure which starts as a diagnostic endoscopy may become a therapeutic endoscopy depending on the findings.</p>
<p id="p-0097" num="0096">Generally, therapeutic endoscopy involves the administration of an endoscope (&#x201c;primary catheter&#x201d;) into a body region until a natural stopping positioning is reached (e.g., until the circumference of the body region inhibits further advancement of the endoscope). Next, a flexible sheath having a circumference smaller than the circumference of the endoscope is advanced through the endoscope and to a desired body region location. Next, a therapeutic or diagnostic tool (e.g., an ablation energy delivery tool) (e.g., a tissue collection tool) (e.g., biopsy needle) having a circumference smaller than the diameter of the flexible sheath is advanced through the flexible sheath to the desired body region location. Next, ablation energy is delivered to the desired body region location. Upon completion of the therapeutic endoscopy, the ablation energy delivery tool is withdrawn through the flexible sheath, the flexible sheath is withdrawn through the endoscope, and the endoscope is withdrawn from the subject.</p>
<p id="p-0098" num="0097">With reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>, a system <b>10</b> for performing an endoscopic procedure on a patient <b>14</b> is illustrated. The system <b>10</b> includes an adjustable mount arm <b>18</b> coupled to a patient bed <b>22</b>, and a bronchoscope <b>26</b> coupled to the adjustable mount arm <b>18</b>. An attachment <b>30</b> (i.e., a bronchoscope attachment, a support arm) is coupled to the bronchoscope <b>26</b> and a steerable sheath <b>34</b> is coupled to the attachment <b>30</b>. As described in greater detail herein, the steerable sheath <b>34</b> is configured to be inserted through the bronchoscope <b>26</b> and a flexible probe <b>38</b> (e.g., a microwave ablation probe) is configured to be inserted through the steerable sheath <b>34</b> and the bronchoscope <b>26</b>. In some embodiments, a medical imaging device <b>40</b> (e.g., X-ray, fluoroscopy, CT, etc.) is utilized with the system <b>10</b> to aid positioning of the bronchoscope <b>26</b>, the steerable sheath <b>34</b>, and the flexible probe <b>38</b> within the patient <b>14</b>. Although the system <b>10</b> is illustrated with a bronchoscope <b>26</b>, the systems disclosed herein can be utilized with any type of endoscope or &#x201c;scope.&#x201d;</p>

For example, a user may loosen the knob <b>70</b>; articulate the adjustable elbow <b>66</b> to position the first and second members <b>58</b>, <b>62</b> in the desired positions; and tighten the knob <b>70</b> to secure the adjustable elbow <b>66</b> and members <b>58</b>, <b>62</b> in position.</p>
<p id="p-0101" num="0100">With continued reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref>, the adjustable mount arm <b>18</b> includes a bronchoscope claw <b>74</b> with a plurality of gripping fingers <b>78</b>. The bronchoscope claw <b>74</b> is configured to receive and hold the bronchoscope <b>26</b> in position relative to the adjustable mount arm <b>18</b>. For example, the bronchoscope claw <b>74</b> is opened by a user and positioned around the bronchoscope <b>26</b> (e.g., the bronchoscope handle) to easily dock the bronchoscope <b>26</b> on the adjustable mount arm <b>18</b>. In some embodiments, the plurality of gripping fingers <b>78</b> includes a non-scratch coating to prevent damage to the bronchoscope <b>26</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0102" num="0101">In operation, the adjustable mount arm <b>18</b> is attached to the bed rail <b>46</b> and the bronchoscope <b>26</b> is clasped within the bronchoscope claw <b>74</b>. Next, the relative positions of the first member <b>58</b> and the second member <b>62</b> may be adjusted by moving the adjustable elbow <b>66</b>. As such, the bronchoscope <b>26</b> is supported in a variety of positions relative to the bed rail <b>46</b> by the adjustable mount arm <b>18</b>. In some embodiments, the claw <b>74</b> is aligned with the patient's mouth to help prevent the creation of bends in the bronchoscope.</p>
<p id="p-0103" num="0102">With reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref>, in some embodiments, the adjustable mount arm <b>18</b> includes a support bracket <b>82</b> to hold a power distribution module (PDM) <b>86</b> for the flexible ablation probe <b>38</b> on the adjustable mount arm <b>18</b> in close proximity to the bronchoscope <b>26</b>. In some embodiments, the power distribution module <b>86</b> is removably coupled to the support bracket <b>82</b> with a dovetail slot arrangement. In some embodiments, the support bracket <b>82</b> includes a magnet <b>90</b> to help retain the power distribution module <b>86</b> in position relative to the support bracket <b>82</b>.

The power distribution module <b>86</b> is configured to be electrically coupled to the flexible ablation probe <b>38</b>. In some embodiments, the power distribution module <b>86</b> controls the microwave energy emitted from the flexible probe <b>38</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0104" num="0103">With continued reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref>, the flexible ablation probe <b>38</b> includes a plug <b>98</b> that is electrically coupled to the power distribution module <b>86</b>. In the illustrated embodiment, the plug <b>98</b> includes keyed features to ensure proper orientation of the plug <b>98</b> relative to the power distribution module <b>86</b>. In some embodiments, the flexible probe <b>38</b> is then inserted directly into the bronchoscope <b>26</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref>). In the illustrated embodiment, the flexible probe <b>38</b> is inserted into a port <b>102</b> formed on the bronchoscope <b>102</b>. In some embodiments, the flexible ablation probe <b>38</b> can provide therapy by delivering microwave energy to targeted tumors.</p>
<p id="p-0105" num="0104">With reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b></figref>, in some embodiments, the adjustable mount arm <b>18</b> includes a support bracket <b>106</b> for a gooseneck dock <b>110</b>. In the illustrated embodiment, the gooseneck dock <b>110</b> includes a mount <b>114</b> removably coupled to the support bracket <b>106</b> at a first end <b>118</b> and a cradle <b>122</b> for supporting a steerable sheath or other tool at a second end <b>126</b>. In some embodiments, the cradle <b>122</b> is configured to support a variety of endoscopic tools or therapy devices.

<p id="p-0122" num="0121">The precise positioning of the flexible probe <b>38</b> when used for lung ablation, for example, is challenging with conventional sheaths and extended working channels, which are primarily static with pre-curved ends that straighten during probe or tool insertion. Conventional sheaths to not provide means to change the trajectory of the probe once placed through the sheath and therefore can become dependent on the patient's airway structure to access the target lesion. Advantageously, the steerable sheaths disclosed herein (e.g., steerable sheath <b>34</b>, <b>138</b>, <b>150</b>, <b>266</b>, <b>434</b>, <b>458</b>, <b>482</b>, <b>582</b>, <b>642</b>, <b>690</b>) improve the precision and control over the positioning of the flexible probe <b>38</b>. The steerable sheath can steer via articulation pull wires and can work with or without a bronchoscope. The steerable sheath allows one-hand use to control insertion and/or removable, rotation, and articulation in more than one direction. The steerable sheath facilitates use in a vertical position for a pulmonary procedure, in contrast to horizontal for sheaths used in cardiac procedures. In some embodiments, the steerable sheath may include axial symmetry to allow for the steerable sheath to be docked in a cradle and still rotate relative to the cradle. The steerable sheath does not require a robotic platform, which can be cost prohibitive. In some embodiments, the steerable sheath is utilized to place other endoscopic tools, therapy device, biopsy device, or local drug delivery device. In some embodiments, the system includes a local drug delivery device (e.g., a flexible needle) configured to be inserted through the steerable sheath and the bronchoscope.

In the illustrated embodiment, the user input wheel <b>386</b> includes a gear <b>524</b> formed thereon and is coupled to the belt <b>522</b>. In other words, the belt <b>522</b> rotatably couples the gear <b>524</b> with the drive gear <b>518</b>. The transmission <b>402</b> further includes a first rack <b>526</b> enmeshed with the drive gear <b>518</b> and a second rack <b>530</b> enmeshed with the drive gear <b>518</b>. A first pull wire <b>534</b> is coupled to the first rack <b>526</b> and a second pull wire <b>538</b> is coupled to the second rack <b>530</b>. In some embodiments, the transmission includes only a single pull wire. In operation, the first rack <b>526</b> and the second rack <b>530</b> translate relative to the drive gear <b>518</b> in response to rotation of the drive gear <b>518</b> driven by the user input wheel <b>386</b>. Translation of the first rack <b>526</b> and the second rack <b>530</b> relative to the housing <b>378</b> causes actuation of the first pull wire <b>534</b> and the second pull wire <b>538</b>, which articulates the distal end <b>398</b> of the sheath <b>390</b>. In some embodiments, actuation of the first pull wire <b>534</b> or the second pull wire <b>538</b> articulates the distal end <b>398</b> of the sheath <b>390</b>. In some embodiments, the pull wires <b>534</b>, <b>538</b> are attached on opposites sides of the distal end <b>398</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0130" num="0129">With reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>24</b></figref>, the housing <b>378</b> includes a first slot <b>542</b> that at least partially receives the first rack <b>526</b> and a second slot <b>546</b> that at least partially receives the second rack <b>530</b>. In the illustrated embodiment, the first rack <b>526</b> and the second rack <b>530</b> are slidable with respect to the housing <b>378</b> along the axis <b>426</b>. A detent <b>550</b> is positioned within the housing <b>378</b>, and the detent <b>550</b> engages the transmission <b>402</b> when the user input wheel <b>386</b> is in the neutral position (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>24</b></figref>). In the illustrated embodiment, the detent <b>550</b> is a ball-spring detent that is at least partially received within a corresponding notch <b>554</b> formed in the first rack <b>526</b>. As such, the detent <b>550</b> allows an operator to easily find and the neutral position for the user input wheel <b>386</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0131" num="0130">With reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>22</b> and <b>23</b></figref>, the steerable sheath <b>266</b> includes a braking assembly <b>558</b> that adjusts the amount of frictional engagement between the housing <b>378</b> and the user input wheel <b>386</b>. In other words, the braking assembly <b>558</b> is configured to adjust the frictional resistance to rotating the user input wheel <b>386</b> about the axis <b>422</b>. As detailed herein, the braking assembly <b>558</b> holds the position of the user input wheel <b>386</b> when the user input wheel <b>386</b> is released by a user. In other words, friction provided by the braking assembly <b>558</b> causes the user input wheel <b>386</b> to remain in the rotational positional left by the operator.</p>
<p id="p-0132" num="0131">In the illustrated embodiment, the user input wheel <b>386</b> includes a hub <b>562</b> positioned around a boss <b>566</b> formed on the housing <b>378</b>. In the illustrated embodiment, the hub <b>562</b> and the boss <b>566</b> are aligned with the rotational axis <b>422</b>. The braking assembly <b>558</b> includes a sleeve <b>570</b> positioned around the boss <b>566</b> and a spring washer <b>574</b> positioned between the sleeve <b>570</b> and the hub <b>562</b>. A fastener <b>578</b> secures the sleeve <b>570</b> to the boss <b>566</b> and the sleeve <b>570</b> is adjustably positioned relative to the hub <b>562</b> on the user input wheel <b>386</b>. In the illustrated embodiment, the fastener <b>578</b> is a screw. Adjusting the fastener <b>578</b> to position the sleeve <b>570</b> closer to the hub <b>562</b> applies a larger compressive force to the spring washer <b>574</b> and creates more frictional resistance to rotation of the user input wheel <b>386</b>. Likewise, adjusting the fastener <b>578</b> to position the sleeve <b>570</b> further from the hub <b>562</b> reduced the compressive force on the spring washer <b>574</b> and reduces the frictional resistance to rotation of the user input wheel <b>386</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0133" num="0132">With reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>25</b></figref>, a steerable sheath <b>582</b> is illustrated with a transmission <b>586</b> coupled between a user input wheel <b>590</b> and a distal end of a sheath <b>594</b>. The transmission <b>586</b> includes a linkage <b>598</b> coupled to the user input wheel <b>590</b> with a pin <b>602</b> received within a corresponding spiral slot <b>606</b>. In the illustrated embodiment, the pin <b>602</b> moves within the spiral slot <b>606</b> in response to rotation of the user input wheel <b>590</b>. The linkage <b>598</b> translates linearly along an axis <b>610</b> in response to rotation of the user input wheel <b>590</b>. In the illustrated embodiment, a rack <b>618</b> is coupled to the linkage <b>598</b> and the rack <b>618</b> is enmeshed with a pinion <b>622</b>. Rotation of the pinion <b>622</b> causes linear translation of a first rack <b>626</b> and a second rack <b>630</b>. Similar to the transmission <b>402</b>, pull wires <b>634</b>, <b>638</b> are coupled to the racks <b>626</b>, <b>630</b> and actuation of the pull wires <b>634</b>, <b>638</b> articulates the distal end of the sheath <b>594</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0134" num="0133">With reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>26</b></figref>, a steerable sheath <b>642</b> is illustrated with a transmission <b>646</b> coupled between a user input wheel <b>650</b> and a distal end of a sheath <b>654</b>. The transmission <b>646</b> includes a planetary gear assembly <b>658</b>, a first power screw <b>662</b>, and a second power screw <b>666</b>. A bevel gear <b>670</b> is enmeshed with gearing <b>674</b> formed on the user input wheel <b>650</b>. A shaft <b>678</b> extending from the bevel gear <b>670</b> extends into the planetary gear assembly <b>658</b> and transfers rotation from the user input wheel <b>650</b> to the planetary gear assembly <b>658</b>. The power screws <b>662</b>, <b>666</b> are coupled to the planetary gear assembly <b>658</b> and translate linearly in response to rotation of the user input wheel <b>650</b>. In the illustrated embodiment, pull wires <b>682</b>, <b>686</b> are coupled to the power screws <b>662</b>, <b>666</b> and actuation of the pull wires <b>682</b>, <b>686</b> articulates the distal end of the sheath <b>654</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0135" num="0134">With reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>27</b></figref>, a steerable sheath <b>690</b> is illustrated with a transmission <b>694</b> coupled between a user input wheel <b>698</b> and a distal end of a sheath. The transmission <b>694</b> includes drive gear <b>702</b> enmeshed with gearing <b>706</b> formed on the user input wheel <b>698</b> and a pawl <b>710</b> selectively engaged with the gearing <b>706</b> to lock the user input wheel <b>698</b> in position. In the illustrated embodiment, pull wires <b>714</b> are coupled to the drive gear <b>702</b> and actuation of the pull wires <b>714</b> articulate the distal end of the sheath.</p>
<p id="p-0136" num="0135">In some embodiments, the transmission of the steerable sheath includes at least one electrical component (e.g., a sensor, an actuator, a power source, a controller, etc.). Advantageously, including an electrical component within the transmission may increase the precision with which the pull wires are actuated and correspondingly the precision with which the distal end of the sheath is actuated.</p>
<p id="p-0137" num="0136">With reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>28</b></figref>, in some embodiments, the flexible probe <b>38</b> is inserted into a working channel <b>718</b> (i.e., into a steerable sheath or a bronchoscope) manually with an operator feeding the flexible probe <b>38</b> into the working channel by hand. However, conventional techniques can cause the flexible probe <b>38</b> to bend, buckle, kink, or otherwise damage the flexible probe <b>38</b> in response to manually feeding the flexible probe <b>38</b> into the working channel. For example, the anatomy of the patient, or the positioning of the scope or the steerable sheath may make it difficult to feed in the flexible probe <b>38</b>. In particular, there are high forces associated with the probe tip exiting the end of the working channel and pushing into tissue or a lesion. These high forces can result in undesirable buckling, bending, and/or kinking of the flexible probe <b>38</b>, which can damage the flexible probe <b>38</b>. As a result, conventional techniques require the user to &#x201c;choke up&#x201d; as much as possible on the probe and use very short advancement strokes to reduce the unsupported length of the probe.</p>
<p id="p-0138" num="0137">With reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>29</b>-<b>30</b></figref>, an anti-buckling device <b>722</b> is illustrated to assist with the insertion of the flexible probe <b>38</b> into the working channel <b>718</b>. The anti-buckling device <b>722</b> includes an inlet funnel <b>726</b>, an outlet <b>730</b>, and a plurality of support rails <b>734</b> extending between the inlet funnel <b>726</b> and the outlet <b>730</b>. In the illustrated embodiment, there are two support rails. In some embodiments, the outlet <b>730</b> includes a threaded luer-lok attachment. The flexible probe <b>38</b> is inserted through the inlet funnel <b>726</b> and out of the outlet <b>7360</b> into the working channel <b>718</b>. In the illustrated embodiment, a portion of the flexible probe <b>38</b> is visible to an external viewer in the space between the support rails <b>734</b>. In some embodiments, the anti-buckling device <b>722</b> is integrated with the working channel <b>718</b></p>
<p id="p-0139" num="0138">The anti-buckling device <b>722</b> further includes a collar <b>738</b> slidable with respect to the support rails <b>734</b> and selectively coupled to the flexible probe <b>38</b>. The collar <b>738</b> includes a button <b>742</b> that selectively engages the flexible probe <b>38</b> upon actuation of the button <b>742</b> by an operator. In the illustrated embodiment, the button <b>742</b> is biased by a biasing member toward a disengaged position in which the button <b>742</b> does not contact the flexible probe <b>38</b> and the collar <b>738</b> is movable with respect to the flexible probe <b>38</b>. A user depresses the button <b>742</b> to move the button <b>742</b> into an engaged position in which the button <b>742</b> abuts the flexible probe <b>38</b>, locking the flexible probe <b>38</b> with the collar <b>738</b> such that movement of the collar <b>738</b> moves the flexible probe <b>38</b>. In some embodiments, the button <b>742</b> may be lockable in the engaged position. Releasing the button <b>742</b> from the engaged position allows the button <b>742</b> to move back to a disengaged position, such that the collar <b>738</b> is movable with respect to the probe <b>38</b>. In some embodiments, the button or the collar also engage the support rails <b>734</b> in addition to the probe, thus locking the position of the probe relative to the working channel.</p>
<p id="p-0140" num="0139">The flexible probe <b>38</b> is also able to move relative to the anti-buckling device <b>722</b> by manually sliding the flexible probe <b>38</b>. In other words, the user has the option of using the collar <b>738</b> or their hands to translate the flexible probe <b>38</b>. In some embodiments, the anti-buckling device is hinged open with two pieces that lock together such that it can be placed after the probe is already with in the working channel (i.e., the anti-buckling device) does not need to be in place prior to probe placement and therefore the probe does not need to be advanced through it initially).</p>
