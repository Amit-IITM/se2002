<heading id="h-0001" level="1">FIELD OF THE DISCLOSURE</heading>
<p id="p-0002" num="0001">The present disclosure relates to methods and systems for controlling and maintaining the temperature of a drink within a drinking vessel.</p>
<heading id="h-0002" level="1">BACKGROUND</heading>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">As a drink sits in a drinking vessel, the temperature of the drink rises or falls to ambient temperature instead of being maintained at, or changed to, a desired drinking temperature. Devices have been developed to maintain the temperature of a drink. One class of devices maintains a drink temperature by being inserted into the contents of the drinking vessel. Another class maintains temperature through beverage jackets (e.g., koozie, hugger, coozie). Another class is a specialized drinking vessel that itself is thermally insulated to maintain the temperature of the drink (e.g., tumbler or frozen glass). Another class includes tabletop containers that can chill a bottle of wine.</p>
<heading id="h-0003" level="1">SUMMARY</heading>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">Innovative aspects of the subject matter described in this specification may be embodied in a system that includes regulating a temperature of a drink, the system including a receptacle system defining a recess for receiving a drinking vessel, including: an outer receptacle, and an inner receptacle that is removably couplable to the outer receptacle, wherein a cavity is defined between the outer receptacle and the inner receptable, the receptacle system comprising a top end portion, a bottom end portion, an inner wall portion, and an outer wall portion, the top end portion defines a top opening of the recess.</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">These and other embodiments may each optionally include one or more of the following features. For instance, a stand for holding the receptacle system, the stand releasably attached to the receptable system. The stand includes a top end positioned opposite a bottom end, the top end of the stand proximate to an attachment point with the receptacle system, the stand further including a reservoir proximate to the top end of the stand. The outer receptacle includes a through hole positioned proximate to the reservoir when the receptacle system is attached to the stand. The outer receptacle includes one or more pathways positioned between an inner surface of the outer receptacle and an inner surface of the inner receptacle, the pathways terminating at the through hole. The stand includes a top end positioned opposite a bottom end, the top end of the stand proximate to an attachment point with the receptacle system, the stand further including a cavity proximate to the top end of the stand. The outer receptacle includes a protruding member, wherein when the receptacle system is attached to the stand, the protruding member is at least partially positioned within the cavity. The protruding member of the outer receptacle and the cavity of the stand include corresponding magnetic members to couple the receptacle system to the stand. The inner receptacle and the outer receptacle include corresponding magnetic members to couple the inner receptacle to the outer receptacle.</p>

<heading id="h-0005" level="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION</heading>
<p id="p-0056" num="0055">In the following description, details are set forth by way of example to facilitate discussion of the disclosed subject matter. It should be apparent to a person of ordinary skill in the field, however, that the disclosed embodiments are exemplary and not exhaustive of all possible embodiments.</p>
<p id="p-0057" num="0056">As will be described in further detail, the inventors of the present disclosure have developed systems and methods for controlling and maintaining the temperature of a drink within a drinking vessel. The systems and methods may allow for better and more convenient temperature control of the drink and thereby better enjoyment of the drink by a user.</p>
<p id="p-0058" num="0057">A user may pour a drink into a drinking vessel and use the system to maintain and control the temperature of the drink. In one example of a system, the system includes a receptacle and a stand. A user may cool or warm the receptacle by placing the receptacle in a freezer or microwave, for example. After waiting for the receptacle to reach a temperature, the user can remove the cooled or warmed receptacle and use the receptacle to hold a drinking vessel containing a drink. As the receptacle holds the drinking vessel, thermal energy is transferred from the drinking vessel to the cooled receptacle or from the heated receptacle to the drinking vessel. The receptacle, by holding the drinking vessel and transferring thermal energy, cools or warms the drinking vessel and maintains and controls the drink's temperature, prolonging the time the drink is cool or warm. The receptacle may be releasably attached to the stand to enable the receptacle to hold, for example, a stemmed wine glass. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b>A</figref> depicts such a system, where a user can control the temperature of a drink within a drinking vessel by placing the drinking vessel in a cooled or warmed receptacle.</p>
<p id="p-0059" num="0058">As shown by example in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b>A</figref>, the system may include a receptacle <b>100</b> releasably attached to a stand <b>102</b>. The receptacle <b>100</b> and stand <b>102</b> may be made from one or more of a variety of materials including plastic, wood, metal, ceramic, or a combination thereof and may include a textured surface to allow for easier grip. The receptacle <b>100</b> defines a recess <b>104</b> to receive and hold a drinking vessel. The recess formed by the receptacle <b>100</b> may take a variety of shapes and be contoured to define a recess to receive a variety of drinking vessels having different shapes.</p>
<p id="p-0060" num="0059">In general, the receptacle <b>100</b> controls or maintains temperature by contacting a drinking vessel. By contacting the drinking vessel where the drinking vessel contains the drink, such as the lower part of the bowl of a wine glass, the receptacle <b>100</b> can efficiently enable the transfer of thermal energy between the heated or cooled receptacle <b>100</b> and the drink.</p>
<p id="p-0061" num="0060">A side opening <b>106</b> may allow a drinking vessel such as a stemmed wine glass to be easily received and still securely held by the recess <b>104</b>. The user may easily place a stemmed wine glass into the receptacle <b>100</b> by placing the stem of the wine glass through the side opening <b>106</b> and setting the bowl of the wine glass in the receptacle <b>100</b>. The side opening <b>106</b> also allows parts of a drinking vessel to be viewed while the receptacle <b>100</b> holds the drinking vessel. As depicted in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b>A</figref>, the side opening <b>106</b> may extend laterally from an inner wall portion <b>108</b> to an outer wall portion <b>110</b>. As also shown by example in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b>A</figref>, the side opening <b>106</b> may also extend vertically from a top opening <b>112</b>, defined by a top end portion <b>116</b> of the receptacle <b>100</b>, to a bottom opening <b>114</b>, defined by a bottom end portion <b>118</b> of the receptacle <b>100</b>. The outer wall portion <b>110</b> and inner wall portion <b>108</b> connect the top end portion <b>116</b> and bottom end portion <b>118</b>. The side opening <b>106</b> allows the user to view their drink but is not so great in size as to let a drinking vessel fall through the receptacle <b>100</b> or to eliminate the temperature control and maintenance benefits of the system.</p>
<p id="p-0062" num="0061">The bottom end portion <b>118</b> as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b>A</figref> is substantially C-shaped and defines a bottom opening <b>114</b> of the recess <b>104</b>. The bottom opening <b>114</b> may be small enough such that a drinking vessel does not fall through the bottom opening <b>114</b>, but large enough such that at least part of a stem of a drinking vessel may extend through the bottom opening <b>114</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0063" num="0062">The top end portion <b>116</b> as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b>A</figref> is also substantially C-shaped. As also shown by example in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b>A</figref>, the top end portion <b>116</b> defines a top opening <b>112</b> of the recess <b>104</b>. The top opening <b>112</b> may allow the recess <b>104</b> to receive a drinking vessel. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b>A</figref>, the top opening <b>112</b> may have a larger cross-sectional area than the bottom opening <b>114</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0064" num="0063">One problem that may occur when a user drinks a cooled drink, or uses other temperature controlling systems, is that condensation accumulates on the drinking vessel or temperature controlling system. When the condensation accumulates, it may drip onto a user's hand, causing the user inconvenience. Moisture may also accumulate and drip onto a foot of a wine glass, for example. When the user drinks from the wine glass, the user may inadvertently pour the moisture from the foot of the wine glass onto the user or other undesired locations, such as the user's dinner plate. The system allows for enjoyment of a drink with reduced or eliminated condensation accumulating at undesired locations.</p>
<p id="p-0065" num="0064">To reduce unwanted user contact with condensation, the bottom end portion <b>118</b> of the receptacle <b>100</b> includes a lip <b>120</b>. The lip <b>120</b> is shown as the lowest point of receptacle <b>100</b>. When condensation accumulates on the system or drinking vessel, it may sweat downward to the lip <b>120</b>. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b>A</figref>, the lip <b>120</b> is located away from the side opening <b>106</b> where the user may grab a drinking vessel and away from a location where the condensation will drip onto a stem of a wine glass, for example. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b>A</figref>, the lip <b>120</b> is shaped as two or more peaks. The lip <b>120</b> is shaped to extend outwardly from the receptacle <b>100</b> or the stand <b>102</b>. With the lip <b>120</b>, condensation that sweats onto the drinking vessel or onto the user is reduced or eliminated. With the lip <b>120</b>, condensation may be redirected from the receptacle <b>100</b> to the stand <b>102</b> and down to the supporting surface upon which the stand <b>102</b> is placed. The system may be alternatively configured such that the lip <b>120</b> is shaped as a single peak, a ridge, a plurality of ridges, or a combination thereof. The lip <b>120</b> may also be part of the stand <b>102</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0066" num="0065">The system includes the stand <b>102</b> to hold the system upright, to allow use with stemmed drinking vessels, or both. The stand <b>102</b> is elongated so that a drinking vessel is lifted off a supporting surface. Although shown as elongated, the stand <b>102</b> may be substantially flat. The receptacle <b>100</b> may also have a flat bottom end portion such that the receptacle <b>100</b> may stand upright without a stand <b>102</b>. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b>A</figref>, the stand <b>102</b> holds the receptacle <b>100</b> upright with the top end portion <b>116</b> substantially above the bottom end portion <b>118</b>. The stand <b>102</b> also has one or more stand prongs <b>122</b><i>a </i>and <b>122</b><i>b</i>. The stand prongs <b>122</b><i>a </i>and <b>122</b><i>b </i>extend radially outward from the receptacle <b>100</b> to provide a wide base and sturdiness to prevent the system or drinking vessel from toppling over. The stand <b>102</b> also has one or more feet <b>124</b><i>a </i>and <b>124</b><i>b </i>for contacting a surface. The feet <b>124</b><i>a </i>and <b>124</b><i>b </i>may contact the supporting surface, such as a tabletop or the ground, thereby holding the stand <b>102</b> upright.</p>
<p id="p-0067" num="0066">The system shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b>A</figref> offers many advantages over previous systems. One advantage of the system is that a user may control and maintain the temperature of their drink while using their own drinking vessel. The user does not have to drink out of a large or lesser quality drinking vessel, such as a bulky insulated container, which may control temperature but diminishes the drinking experience. Another advantage is that the drinking vessel and drink may be viewed while in use, as opposed to a system that prevents viewing, such as a koozie. Viewing a drink enhances the user's experience by allowing the user to enjoy the color of the drink, for example. An additional advantage of the system is that the user may fine-tune the temperature to their liking. For example, the user may simply lift their drinking vessel from the receptacle and hold or set the drinking vessel directly on a supporting surface to allow the drink to warm slightly. The user may place the drinking vessel in the receptacle as the user desires to fine-tune the temperature. When using a tumbler, instead of the system in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b>A</figref> for example, the user may not simply remove the drink from a tumbler and place the drink back into the tumbler. A further advantage of the system shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b>A</figref> is that it reduces the condensation that drips onto the user's hand. The system also is advantageous in that it is shaped to resist toppling over.</p>
<p id="p-0068" num="0067">One advantage of the system is that the system may include releasably attachable components. For example, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b>B</figref> shows the system of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b>A</figref>, with the receptacle <b>100</b> detached from the stand <b>102</b>. When the system has a receptacle <b>100</b> that is detachable, a user may place only the receptacle <b>100</b> in a cooling environment (such as a freezer or refrigerator) or heating environment (such as an oven, microwave, or heat lamp) without the stand <b>102</b>. The cooling environment and heating environment may be any environment where the temperature is below or above room temperature, respectively. A user may save space in the cooling or heating environment by detaching the stand <b>102</b> and placing only the receptacle <b>100</b> in the cooling or heating environment.</p>
<p id="p-0069" num="0068">Detachability using a common attachment shape also allows for modularity, for example, a system where the stand <b>102</b> can releasably attach to numerous receptacles with the same or different shapes. Detachability allows one or more receptacles to be placed in a cooling or heating environment while another receptacle is in use, attached to the stand <b>102</b>, or both. The user may detach a first receptacle from a stand and replace the first receptacle with a second receptacle that is cooled or heated. Therefore, a user may enjoy a first drink with the first receptacle and, when the user is ready for a second drink, the user may use a second receptacle that is already cooled or heated. The user can enjoy each drink at a desired temperature. Detachability also allows the stand to remain at a comfortable temperature for the user to handle. Detachability further allows modularity in that the receptacle <b>100</b> may be used with a plurality or variety of stands. The receptacle <b>100</b> may attach to the stand <b>102</b> by mating parts such as a pin and hole, magnets, a hinge, joint, or any other attachment mechanism. When the system has multiple receptacles or stands, some or all receptacles and some or all stands may have common attachment shapes, allowing for a system with interchangeable, modular parts. For example, every receptacle can include the same-shaped hole and every stand can include the same-shaped pin to connect to the hole. As an additional example, every receptacle may have a magnet with the same-shaped contacting surface and every stand may have a magnet with the same-shaped contacting surface. Detachability also allows for the receptacle <b>100</b> to be used with different-shaped stands, as described later. As also described later, detachability allows for a stand <b>102</b> to be used with different-shaped receptacles. In some systems, the receptacle <b>100</b> may be fixedly attached to the stand <b>102</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0070" num="0069">As an example of how the system holds a drinking vessel, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b>C</figref> depicts the system of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>1</b>A and <b>1</b>B</figref> holding a drinking vessel <b>126</b> with a first shape. After the receptacle <b>100</b> is removed from a cooling or heating environment, the receptacle <b>100</b> may be releasably but securely attached to the stand <b>102</b>. The drinking vessel <b>126</b> may then be held by the receptacle <b>100</b>, and the receptacle <b>100</b> may contact lower portions of the drinking vessel <b>126</b> nearest the drinkable fluid, thereby maintaining and controlling the drink's temperature efficiently.</p>
<p id="p-0071" num="0070">As viewable in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b>C</figref>, the top end portion <b>116</b> and bottom end portion <b>118</b> are substantially C-shaped about the drinking vessel <b>126</b>. The bottom opening <b>114</b> is small enough such that the drinking vessel <b>126</b> does not fall through the bottom opening <b>114</b>, but large enough such that the stem of the drinking vessel <b>126</b> extends through the bottom opening <b>114</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0072" num="0071">While holding the drinking vessel <b>126</b>, at least part of the receptacle <b>100</b> may contact the drinking vessel <b>126</b> while the recess <b>104</b> of the receptacle <b>100</b> receives the drinking vessel <b>126</b>. The contact of the drinking vessel <b>126</b> by the receptacle <b>100</b> allows the system to efficiently transfer thermal energy, thereby controlling and maintaining the temperature of the drinking vessel <b>126</b>. The side opening <b>106</b> allows parts of the drinking vessel <b>126</b> to be viewed while the system holds the drinking vessel <b>126</b>. The system need not have a side opening. Without the side opening <b>106</b>, the system may even more efficiently control and maintain the temperature of a drink by fully enclosing the drinking vessel. But a system that allows a user to view the drink while enjoying the drink may enhance a user's experience. For example, the user may enjoy watching bubbles rise in their champagne. The user may enjoy viewing the caramel color of their scotch or the deep red of their Bordeaux. The side opening <b>106</b> also allows the stemmed drinking vessel <b>126</b> to be easily placed within and removed from the recess <b>104</b>. The stand <b>102</b> may be elongated so that the drinking vessel <b>126</b> is lifted off a supporting surface as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b>C</figref>. A drinking vessel may need to be lifted off of a supporting surface if, for example, the drinking vessel has a stem.</p>
<p id="p-0073" num="0072">The system as shown allows for use with a drinking vessel <b>126</b> designed to be used with a particular drink. The drinking vessel <b>126</b> is designed for red wine. A user may wish to enjoy a drink out of a drinking vessel designed for a particular drink. For example, the user may enjoy using a champagne flute for champagne as the champagne flute itself creates a long path for champagne bubbles to rise. A user may also wish to enjoy drinks out of glasses other than champagne flutes, such as a martini out of a coupe. As a further example, many wine glasses are shaped differently to direct the flow of a specific wine variety onto parts of the user's tongue or affect the aromas that a user smells. Drinking vessels may also have aesthetic qualities such as thin or decorative glass that is unmatched by bulky insulated containers. The system is advantageous in that it allows a user to enjoy a temperature-controlled drink out of the drinking vessel specifically designed for that drink.</p>
<p id="p-0074" num="0073">The system also allows for controlling the temperature of a drink without inserting a foreign object into the drink itself. Such a foreign object may decrease enjoyment of the drink by adding weight to the drinking vessel, changing the feel of the drinking vessel, affecting taste and smell of the drink, causing unwanted contact of the user's lips or face with the foreign object, and decreasing the aesthetic value of a drinking vessel containing a drink. The system allows a user to enjoy drinking from a drinking vessel <b>126</b>, while the drink's temperature is controlled and maintained, without diminishing the enjoyment of the drink with a foreign object. An additional advantage of the system is that the user may fine-tune the temperature to their liking. For example, the user may simply lift their drinking vessel from the receptacle and hold or set the drinking vessel directly on a supporting surface to allow the drink to warm slightly. In systems that use a foreign object placed within the drink contents, it may be difficult for a user to fine-tune the temperature of their drink because the user will have to insert their hand into the drink contents.</p>
<p id="p-0075" num="0074">Although the drinking vessel <b>126</b> is shown having a first shape, the system may be used with a variety of drinking vessels with different shapes. The system may hold different-shaped drinking vessels, such as a red wine glass, a Bordeaux glass, a Burgundy glass, a white wine glass, a stemmed wine glass, a stemless wine glass, a round wine glass, a wine glass with angled edges, a champagne flute, a pint glass, a whiskey glass, a martini glass, a coupe glass, a glass with any variety of shapes, a can, a bottle, or any other vessel used to contain a drink. As will be described herein, the receptacle <b>100</b> can be shaped to provide surface-to-surface contact with numerous different-shaped drinking vessels. Another way the system can be used with different-shaped drinking vessels is by having numerous receptacles defining different recess for receiving a variety of different-shaped drinking vessels.</p>
<p id="p-0076" num="0075"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>2</b>A, <b>2</b>B, <b>2</b>C, <b>2</b>D, and <b>2</b>E</figref> provide examples of how the system of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b>A through <b>1</b>C</figref> may be used with different-shaped drinking vessels. The receptacle <b>100</b> may define a recess that can receive a variety of different drinking vessels, such as the drinking vessel <b>126</b> with the first shape of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b>C</figref>, shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b>A</figref>. The recess may also receive a drinking vessel <b>128</b> with a second shape shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b>B</figref>, a drinking vessel <b>130</b> with a third shape shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b>C</figref>, a drinking vessel <b>132</b> with a fourth shape shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b>D</figref>, and a drinking vessel <b>133</b> with a fifth shape shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b>E</figref>. The drinking vessels <b>126</b>, <b>128</b>, <b>130</b>, and <b>132</b> are wine glasses. The drinking vessel <b>133</b> is a coupe glass. The receptacle <b>100</b> may be shaped to allow for a large surface area of the inner wall portion <b>108</b> to contact drinking vessels of a variety of different shapes and sizes. Increased contact area allows more efficient temperature control because the thermal energy transfer is dependent on how much surface of the drinking vessel is contacted near the drink. In the exemplary embodiment shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b>A through <b>2</b>E</figref>, the inner wall portion <b>108</b> is specially shaped with a multivessel contour to contact a large surface area of a variety of different-shaped drinking vessels near where the drink is contained.</p>
<p id="p-0077" num="0076">An example of the multivessel contour is depicted in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b>A through <b>2</b>E</figref>. At the top end portion <b>116</b>, a top incline <b>134</b> has a top slope. &#x201c;Slope&#x201d; in this disclosure refers to the mathematical numerical descriptor. When the receptacle is sitting upright and is holding a drinking vessel, the top slope may have a magnitude such that the top incline <b>134</b> is nearly perpendicular to the supporting surface upon which the system stands. The top incline <b>134</b> contacts the drinking vessel <b>128</b> in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b>B</figref> and contacts the drinking vessel <b>130</b> in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b>C</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0078" num="0077">The inner wall portion <b>108</b> may also have a curved surface <b>136</b>. The curved surface <b>136</b> may better accommodate drinking vessels that have wide bowls, angular edges, or both. The curved surface <b>136</b> connects the top incline <b>134</b> and a middle incline <b>138</b>. The curved surface <b>136</b> is shown as having a smooth surface but may be jagged or may include a combination of smooth and jagged surfaces to more firmly hold a drinking vessel or to accommodate other drinking vessels. Although jagged surfaces may decrease surface area contact, jagged surfaces may prevent slippage. The curved surface <b>136</b> contacts the drinking vessel <b>130</b> in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b>C</figref> and the drinking vessel <b>133</b> in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b>E</figref>. The middle incline <b>138</b> may have a middle slope of less magnitude than the top slope of the top incline <b>134</b>. The middle incline <b>138</b> accommodates drinking vessels that may curve inwardly towards the bottom of the bowl of the drinking vessel. The middle incline <b>138</b> contacts the drinking vessel <b>130</b> in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b>C</figref> and the drinking vessel <b>133</b> in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b>E</figref>. The middle incline <b>138</b> is connected to a bottom incline <b>140</b> at the bottom end portion <b>118</b>. The bottom incline <b>140</b> may have a bottom slope of greater magnitude than the middle slope of the middle incline <b>138</b> and less magnitude than the top slope of the top incline <b>134</b>. The bottom incline <b>140</b> allows for a larger surface area of the receptacle to contact narrow drinking vessels, for example. The bottom incline <b>140</b> contacts the drinking vessel <b>126</b> in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b>A</figref>, the drinking vessel <b>128</b> in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b>B</figref>, the drinking vessel <b>130</b> in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b>C</figref>, the drinking vessel <b>132</b> in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b>D</figref>, and the drinking vessel <b>133</b> in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b>E</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0079" num="0078">The system is therefore advantageous over other systems as it can control the temperature of a variety of different drinking vessels with different shapes. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b>A through <b>2</b>E</figref> provide five examples of how a receptacle with one shape can hold different-shaped drinking vessels to provide suitable surface area contact to provide thermal conduction. The system may also be configured such that the inner wall portion <b>108</b> includes convex contours, concave contours, or both to provide surface contact area for particular drinking vessels.</p>
<p id="p-0080" num="0079">An additional advantage of the system, viewable in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b>A through <b>2</b>E</figref>, is an inner cavity <b>142</b>. The inner cavity <b>142</b> allows for efficient and long-lasting temperature control, insulation, or a combination thereof. For example, the inner cavity <b>142</b> may carry and contain a liquid solution. When placed in the freezer, the liquid solution may freeze, thereby increasing the time and degree of drink temperature control and maintenance.</p>
<p id="p-0081" num="0080">As shown by <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b>A through <b>2</b>E</figref>, between the inner wall portion <b>108</b> and outer wall portion <b>110</b>, and between the top end portion <b>116</b> and bottom end portion <b>118</b>, there may be defined an inner cavity <b>142</b>. The top end portion <b>116</b>, bottom end portion <b>118</b>, inner wall portion <b>108</b>, and outer wall portion <b>110</b>, define a top boundary, bottom boundary, inner boundary, and outer boundary of the inner cavity <b>142</b>, respectively. The boundaries enclose the inner cavity <b>142</b>. The inner cavity <b>142</b> may contain and carry air or gasses. The inner cavity <b>142</b> may include an evacuated chamber. The evacuated chamber in the inner cavity <b>142</b> may have a pressure less than 600 Torr, less than 10<sup>&#x2212;1 </sup>Torr, less than 10<sup>&#x2212;2 </sup>Torr, less than 10<sup>&#x2212;3 </sup>Torr, or less than 10<sup>&#x2212;4 </sup>Torr. The inner cavity <b>142</b> may contain and carry solids, such as Styrofoam or plastic-coated wood. The inner cavity <b>142</b> may contain and carry a liquid solution such that the inner cavity <b>142</b> is partially or fully filled. The liquid solution may include water, gel such as alcohol gel, a solute, or a combination thereof. A liquid solution in the inner cavity <b>142</b> may have a freezing point, for example, above the temperature of household freezers. The inner cavity <b>142</b> may allow for longer temperature retention of the receptacle, thereby increasing the time the temperature of a drink is controlled. The inner cavity <b>142</b> may include an expansion area, allowing room for a solution to expand, such that a frozen solution does not exert sufficient pressure on the boundaries of the inner cavity <b>142</b> so as to damage the receptacle. Although an inner cavity <b>142</b> is shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b>A through <b>2</b>E</figref>, the system may include a receptacle or receptacles without an inner cavity <b>142</b>. Although only part of the system is shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b>A through <b>2</b>E</figref>, the inner cavity may extend around the receptacle to encompass a drinking vessel or may be housed in a portion or portions of the receptacle.</p>
<p id="p-0082" num="0081">One advantage of the system is that it may use multiple receptacles to hold different-shaped drinking vessels. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b>A through <b>3</b>E</figref> depict multiple receptacles with different shapes defining recesses with different shapes. Each receptacle may releasably attach to the same stand via common attachment shapes. For example, each receptacle may attach to any one or more stands by mating parts such as a pin and hole, or complimenting shapes, magnets, a hinge, joint, or any other attachment mechanism. All receptacles and stands in a system may share common attachment shapes to allow for modularity and interchangeability. In addition to accommodating multiple different drinking vessels, multiple receptacles allow for one or more receptacles to be heated or cooled while another receptacle is in use. For example, a user may be using one receptacle in a system to chill a drinking vessel while another receptacle is sitting in the user's freezer. Each receptacle may be used with and releasably attached to a variety of stands, for example with each stand shown in other FIG. in this disclosure. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b>E</figref> shows a system with the stand <b>102</b> and a receptacle <b>143</b>. The receptacle <b>143</b> is releasably attached to the stand <b>102</b> and is holding a champagne flute <b>135</b>. Although <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b>A through <b>3</b>E</figref> show multiple receptacles with different shapes, the system may include multiple receptacles with the same shape, such as receptacles shown in other FIG. A system with multiple receptacles with the same shape is beneficial, for example, because a user can have a cooled receptacle for each additional glass of wine. Further, as mentioned earlier, a receptacle can receive many different types of drinking vessels.</p>
<p id="p-0083" num="0082">Another advantage of the system is that it may be used in different settings. For example, the system may have different stands for different uses, such as for use outdoors. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>4</b>A, <b>4</b>B, and <b>4</b>C</figref> collectively depict multiple stands in which different receptacles with common attachment shapes may be used. For example, each depicted stand may be used with and releasably attached to receptacles shown in other FIG. in this disclosure.</p>
<p id="p-0084" num="0083">An elongated stand may be used to hold above a supporting surface and cool, for example, a stemmed wine glass. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b>A</figref> depicts a stand <b>102</b>, shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b>A through <b>1</b>C</figref>, that may be used with a stemmed wine glass. The stand <b>102</b> as shown is elongated. The stand <b>102</b> is operable to hold a receptacle upright. The depicted embodiment has two stand prongs <b>122</b><i>a </i>and <b>122</b><i>b</i>, each with a foot <b>124</b><i>a </i>and <b>124</b><i>b</i>. The feet <b>124</b><i>a </i>and <b>124</b><i>b </i>may contact the surface, such as a tabletop or the ground, thereby holding the stand <b>102</b> upright.</p>
<p id="p-0085" num="0084">For use outdoors or for use with a soft, penetrable supporting surface such as earth, a stand may be configured to be inserted into the supporting surface. For example, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b>B</figref> depicts a stand <b>144</b>. The stand <b>144</b> as shown is elongated and has a pointed end <b>146</b>. The pointed end <b>146</b> may be inserted securely into a soft supporting surface such as dirt, sand, or grass. The stand <b>144</b> may have two stand prongs <b>148</b><i>a </i>and <b>148</b><i>b</i>. When attached to a receptacle, the stand <b>144</b> can thereby hold a receptacle upright above a soft surface. For example, a user may wish to cool a drink while sitting on the ground outdoors.</p>
<p id="p-0086" num="0085">For use with a drinking vessel without a stem, such as a stemless wine glass, mug, or a whiskey glass, a stand may be configured so as to use minimal space. For example, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b>C</figref> depicts a stand <b>150</b>. The stand <b>150</b> as shown is substantially flat. The stand <b>150</b> is shown with one foot <b>152</b>. The stand <b>150</b> may hold a receptacle upright. The stand may have two stand prongs <b>154</b><i>a </i>and <b>154</b><i>b</i>. Although a receptacle may be configured to be substantially flat at a bottom end portion to hold, for example, a stemless wine glass, coffee cup, or snifter, upright without a stand, the stand <b>150</b> may be attached to a receptacle to hold a stemless wine glass (or a variety of other drinking vessels). The foot <b>152</b> may contact the surface, such as a tabletop or the ground, thereby holding the stand <b>150</b> upright.</p>
<p id="p-0087" num="0086">Different stands, as depicted by example in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b>A through <b>4</b>C</figref> allow for a system with greater versatility than other systems. The different stands allow for a system that can be used with different drinking vessels and in different environments. A user may wish to use a drinking vessel with a stem, such as a wine glass or a drinking vessel without a stem, such as a whiskey glass. The user may wish to use a drinking vessel while sitting at a table or while sitting on the ground at a picnic.</p>
<p id="p-0088" num="0087">As described above, the system may include a lip to route condensation away from undesired locations. The system may also include a condensation path to route condensation. For example, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b></figref> depicts the system of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b>A through <b>1</b>C</figref> with a highlighted condensation path <b>156</b>. As shown by example in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b></figref>, the condensation path <b>156</b> may be formed in part or wholly by contours of the receptacle <b>100</b> and stand <b>102</b>. For example, the inner wall portion <b>108</b> is sloped downwardly towards lip <b>120</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0089" num="0088">The condensation path <b>156</b> allows for moisture that accumulates on the drinking vessel or system to flow to a desired location, such as a foot <b>124</b><i>a </i>or <b>124</b><i>b</i>, or a location on the receptacle <b>100</b>. The location on the receptacle <b>100</b> for the moisture to flow is away from where the user will grab the drinking vessel at the side opening <b>106</b>, and away from where the condensation will drip onto a foot of a wine glass, for example. As highlighted in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b></figref>, condensation path <b>156</b> extends from the receptacle <b>100</b> to the stand <b>102</b>. The condensation path <b>156</b> includes the lip <b>120</b>. The lip <b>120</b> may be shaped to protrude downwardly, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b></figref>, such that condensation drips off the lip <b>120</b>, away from the user's hand. In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b></figref>, the condensation path <b>156</b> includes the lip <b>120</b> and ends at the feet <b>124</b><i>a </i>and <b>124</b><i>b. </i></p>
<p id="p-0090" num="0089">The condensation path <b>156</b> may be formed differently. For example, the system may include a condensation path that is formed in part or wholly by a groove on the surface of the inner wall portion <b>108</b>, stand <b>102</b>, or both. The condensation path <b>156</b> is yet another advantage the system may have, as it prevents unwanted moisture from traveling to undesired locations.</p>
<p id="p-0091" num="0090">As described above, lip <b>120</b> offers advantages such as reducing or eliminating moisture contact with a user's hand. To view lip <b>120</b>, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>6</b></figref> depicts a side view of receptacle <b>100</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b></figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0092" num="0091">Another advantage of the system is that it may also be used to efficiently control the temperature of a drink within a drinking vessel such as a pint glass. An additional advantage may allow the pint glass and drink to be viewable while the system controls and maintains the drink temperature. An additional advantage of the system is that the user may fine-tune the temperature to their liking. For example, the user may simply lift their drinking vessel from the receptacle and hold or set the drinking vessel directly on a supporting surface to allow the drink to warm slightly. A stand may also have added functionality to increase insulation and improve the time the drink is maintained at a desired temperature. For example, a stand may have an evacuated chamber to improve insulation. A stand may also be securely and releasably attachable to the receptacle by complimenting the shape of the receptacle, thereby shrouding the receptacle. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>7</b>A</figref> depicts an example of the system for controlling the temperature of a drink with a receptacle <b>158</b> and a stand <b>160</b>. The receptacle <b>158</b> is shown detached from the stand <b>160</b>. The receptacle <b>158</b> is shaped to define a recess <b>162</b> to receive a drinking vessel <b>164</b> such as a pint glass. The inner wall portion <b>166</b> is sloped inwardly from the top end portion <b>168</b> to the bottom end portion <b>170</b>. The outer wall portion <b>172</b> is sloped inwardly from the top end portion <b>168</b> to the bottom end portion <b>170</b>. Since the receptacle <b>158</b> compliments the shape of the drinking vessel <b>164</b>, the receptacle <b>158</b> allows for a large surface area of the receptacle <b>158</b> to contact the drinking vessel, thereby enabling efficient transfer of thermal energy.</p>
<p id="p-0093" num="0092">The receptacle <b>158</b> shown defines a side opening <b>174</b> to allow parts of a drinking vessel <b>164</b> to be viewed while the system holds the drinking vessel <b>164</b>. Alternatively, a receptacle may fully shroud the pint glass. The side opening <b>174</b> also allows the drinking vessel <b>164</b> to be easily received by the recess <b>162</b> by providing the user more space to grab the drinking vessel <b>164</b>. As depicted in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>7</b>A</figref>, the side opening <b>174</b> extends laterally from the inner wall portion <b>166</b> to the outer wall portion <b>172</b>. As described above in this disclosure, between the inner wall portion <b>166</b> and outer wall portion <b>172</b>, and between the top end portion <b>168</b> and bottom end portion <b>170</b>, there may be defined an inner cavity.</p>
<p id="p-0094" num="0093">The stand <b>160</b> also defines a stand side opening <b>176</b> such that the drinking vessel <b>164</b> is viewable when held by the receptacle <b>158</b> when the receptacle <b>158</b> is releasably attached to the stand <b>160</b>. The stand <b>160</b> includes an evacuated chamber. The evacuated chamber may be contained between a stand inner wall portion <b>178</b>, a stand outer wall portion <b>180</b>, a top stand portion <b>182</b>, and a bottom stand portion <b>184</b>. The evacuated chamber has a pressure less than 600 Torr, less than 10<sup>&#x2212;1 </sup>Torr, less than 10<sup>&#x2212;2 </sup>Torr, less than 10<sup>&#x2212;3 </sup>Torr, or less than 10<sup>&#x2212;4 </sup>Torr. The evacuated chamber provides for better insulation of the drinking vessel <b>164</b> when the receptacle <b>158</b> is holding the drinking vessel <b>164</b> and is releasably attached to the stand <b>160</b>. The stand <b>160</b> and receptacle <b>158</b> also may include an outer texture sleeve to allow for better grip when, for example, the user removes the receptacle <b>158</b> from a freezer. The outer texture sleeve may be releasably attachable.</p>
<p id="p-0095" num="0094">The system as configured for a pint glass or other glasses may include the releasably attachable functionality and modularity. As mentioned above, releasably attachable parts may save space, for example in a freezer, and may add versatility to the system. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>7</b>B</figref> depicts the system for controlling the temperature of a drink in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>7</b>A</figref>, with the receptacle <b>158</b> releasably attached to the stand <b>160</b>. In the depicted example, the receptacle <b>158</b> and stand <b>160</b> releasably attach by being complimentarily shaped, such that the receptacle <b>158</b> fits tightly within the stand <b>160</b>. As shown by <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>7</b>B</figref>, the stand <b>160</b> shrouds the receptacle <b>158</b> and may thereby improve insulation and increase the time of temperature control. Also as shown by <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>7</b>B</figref>, the drinking vessel <b>164</b> viewable due to the side opening <b>174</b> and stand side opening <b>176</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0096" num="0095"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>7</b>A and <b>7</b>B</figref> use a pint glass as an example. The receptacle <b>158</b> and stand <b>160</b> depicted in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>7</b>A and <b>7</b>B</figref> may be complimentarily shaped to releasably attach and fit any drinking vessel. To provide longer temperature control and maintenance, the system may have a receptacle without a side opening and a stand without a stand side opening.</p>
<p id="p-0097" num="0096">The system offers further advantages over previous systems in that it may include a rack to allow for easy carrying. Other systems may be bulky and therefore difficult to carry and store. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>8</b>A</figref> depicts a portion of an exemplary system, a rack <b>186</b>. The rack <b>186</b> has a tray <b>188</b> that is used to carry one or more receptacles releasably attached to stands, one or more drinking vessels, or a combination thereof. The tray <b>188</b> has a hand <b>190</b><i>a</i>, a hand <b>190</b><i>b</i>, and a hand <b>190</b><i>c</i>, each for receiving a receptacle releasably attached to a stand, a drinking vessel, or a combination thereof. Each hand <b>190</b><i>a</i>, <b>190</b><i>b</i>, and <b>190</b><i>c </i>is substantially C-shaped, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>8</b>A</figref>. Alternatively, hands may be shaped as two straight lines, for example. The hands <b>190</b><i>a</i>, <b>190</b><i>b</i>, and <b>190</b><i>c </i>fit under a receptacle, drinking vessel, or both to lift the receptacle, drinking vessel, or both when a user exerts an upward force on the hands <b>190</b><i>a</i>, <b>190</b><i>b</i>, and <b>190</b><i>c</i>. The rack <b>186</b> may include any number of hands to carry any number of one or more receptacles releasably attached to stands, one or more drinking vessels, or a combination thereof.</p>
<p id="p-0098" num="0097">The rack <b>186</b> has a first arm <b>192</b> attached to a first tray side <b>194</b>. The first arm <b>192</b> may be attached to the first tray side <b>194</b> by a hinge, joint, mating parts such as a pin and hole, or complimenting shapes, magnets, or any other attachment mechanism. The rack <b>186</b> has a second arm <b>196</b> attached to the second tray side <b>198</b>. The second arm <b>196</b> may be attached to the second tray side <b>198</b> by a hinge, joint, mating parts such as a pin and hole, or complimenting shapes, magnets, or any other attachment mechanism. The first arm <b>192</b> and the second arm <b>196</b> are attached such that the first arm <b>192</b> and the second arm <b>196</b> may fold, as described later. The first arm <b>192</b> and the second arm <b>196</b> have movable secondary arms <b>200</b><i>a </i>and <b>200</b><i>b </i>further attaching the first arm <b>192</b> and second arm <b>196</b>, respectively, to the tray <b>188</b>. The rack <b>186</b> may also have two rack feet <b>202</b><i>a </i>and <b>202</b><i>b </i>to stand the rack <b>186</b> upright on a supporting surface. The rack feet <b>202</b><i>a </i>and <b>202</b><i>b </i>are attached to the tray <b>188</b> and are foldable under the tray <b>188</b>. The rack feet <b>202</b><i>a </i>and <b>202</b><i>b </i>may be attached to the tray <b>188</b> by a hinge, joint, mating parts such as a pin and hole, or complimenting shapes, magnets, or any other attachment mechanism. The rack <b>186</b> includes a rack handle <b>201</b> to allow the user to more easily carry the rack <b>186</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0099" num="0098">Storage spaces can be limited in settings where one or more drinking vessels, receptacles, stands, or a combination thereof are used. For example, a restaurant or bar may need numerous receptacles and drinking vessels and may need a rack to carry the receptacles to tables. But the restaurant may have limited storage space. Therefore, a rack that can carry the system but can be stored in a small amount of space is desired. The rack <b>186</b> can further save space for the user by being foldable when not being used for carrying.

<p id="p-0102" num="0101">In an exemplary system, the system includes a canister to hold a wine bottle and multiple stands for attaching receptacles. Users may wish to maintain the temperature of a bottle while viewing it or sharing it at a restaurant. The canister may be configured to receive any type of bottle or drinking vessel. The system can simultaneously control and maintain the temperature of wine within a wine bottle and wine poured into wine glasses. Users may also wish to easily carry one or more receptacles, stands, drinking vessels, bottles, or a combination thereof. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>11</b>A</figref> depicts an exemplary system that allows for easy carrying and simultaneous temperature control of drinking vessels and a bottle. Each receptacle <b>100</b><i>a</i>, <b>100</b><i>b</i>, and <b>100</b><i>c </i>is shown releasably attached to stands <b>208</b><i>a</i>, <b>208</b><i>b</i>, and <b>208</b><i>c</i>, respectively. The stands <b>208</b><i>a</i>, <b>208</b><i>b</i>, and <b>208</b><i>c </i>are mounted on a canister <b>210</b>. The canister <b>210</b> has a fourth stand mounted on a rear side of the canister, not viewable in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>11</b>A</figref>. The stands <b>208</b><i>a</i>, <b>208</b><i>b</i>, and <b>208</b><i>c </i>may alternatively be releasably attached to the canister <b>210</b>. The canister <b>210</b> is operable to receive a wine bottle <b>212</b> with a canister recess <b>214</b> defined by the canister <b>210</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0103" num="0102">To maintain and control the temperature of the wine bottle <b>212</b>, the canister <b>210</b> may be thermally insulated so as to prevent thermal energy from traveling into the canister recess <b>214</b>. For example, the canister <b>210</b> may include a canister inner cavity. The canister inner cavity may include an evacuated chamber. The evacuated chamber in the canister inner cavity may have a pressure less than 600 Torr, less than 10<sup>&#x2212;1 </sup>Torr, less than 10<sup>&#x2212;2 </sup>Torr, less than 10<sup>&#x2212;3 </sup>Torr, or less than 10<sup>&#x2212;4 </sup>Torr. To maintain and control the temperature of the wine bottle <b>212</b>, for example, the canister inner cavity may be filled with thermal material including a solid, gas, liquid, or combination thereof. The canister inner cavity or canister recess <b>214</b> may be filled with ice to control and maintain the temperature of the wine. The user may place the canister <b>210</b> in a cooling or heating environment before use.</p>
<p id="p-0104" num="0103">The canister <b>210</b> may include a removable inner sleeve. The removable inner sleeve may function so that the user can store only the removable inner sleeve in a heating or cooling environment so as to save space in the heating or cooling environment. The removable inner sleeve may be part of or include any part of the canister <b>210</b>. For example, the inner sleeve may include the inner cavity and evacuated chamber.</p>
<p id="p-0105" num="0104">One advantage of the system of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>11</b>A</figref> is that it allows a user to simultaneously control the temperature of wine within a wine bottle and wine within drinking vessels held by the receptacles <b>100</b><i>a</i>, <b>100</b><i>b</i>, and <b>100</b><i>c</i>. Since the receptacles <b>100</b><i>a</i>, <b>100</b><i>b</i>, and <b>100</b><i>c </i>are releasably attachable to the stands <b>208</b><i>a</i>, <b>208</b><i>b</i>, and <b>208</b><i>c </i>mounted on the canister <b>210</b>, receptacles that have been warmed over time may be swapped for cool receptacles. The system therefore allows the temperature of drink to be controlled and maintained for extended periods of time. Additionally, the system may be used with receptacles with different shapes to accommodate different drinking vessels. The system can therefore be used when, for example, users wish to enjoy wine of a first type using a first type of glass, then switch to a second type of wine using a second type of glass. A system with a canister may be configured to use any number of receptacles and stands. The system may be used with stands with different lengths or extendable stands for differently sized tables. The system may have more or less stands and receptacles. A canister may be shaped to receive multiple bottles.</p>
<p id="p-0106" num="0105">Users may wish to enjoy the benefits of a canister, such as easy carrying and simultaneous temperature-control of a bottle, while also enjoying the mobility of a freestanding receptacle and stand. Each pair of freestanding receptacles and stands may be independently moved by each user, while still holding a drinking vessel, thereby temperature-controlling a drinking vessel and allowing each user to place their drinking vessel at a reachable location. Such mobility may be desired at a large table, where it may be difficult for all users to reach one location. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>11</b>B</figref> is an exemplary system with a canister <b>215</b> having freestanding receptacles <b>100</b><i>a</i>, <b>100</b><i>b</i>, and <b>100</b><i>c</i>, stands <b>102</b><i>a</i>, <b>102</b><i>b</i>, and <b>102</b><i>c </i>and drinking vessels <b>126</b><i>a</i>, <b>126</b><i>b</i>, and <b>126</b><i>c</i>. The receptacles <b>100</b><i>a</i>, <b>100</b><i>b</i>, and <b>100</b><i>c </i>are releasably attached to the stands <b>102</b><i>a</i>, <b>102</b><i>b</i>, and <b>102</b><i>c</i>, respectively. To securely hold receptacles and stands, canister arms <b>217</b><i>a </i>and <b>217</b><i>b </i>are mounted on the canister <b>215</b>. Additional canister arms are mounted on the front and rear of the canister <b>215</b> but are not viewable at the angle shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>11</b>B</figref>. The canister arms <b>217</b><i>a </i>and <b>217</b><i>b </i>fit under receptacles <b>100</b><i>a </i>and <b>100</b><i>b </i>and the stands <b>102</b><i>a </i>and <b>102</b><i>b</i>. The canister arms <b>217</b><i>a </i>and <b>217</b><i>b </i>may be shaped to fit securely around the stand and receptacle to hold the receptacle and stand, while not intruding on the recess or preventing the receptacles <b>100</b><i>a </i>and <b>100</b><i>b </i>from holding the drinking vessels <b>126</b><i>a </i>and <b>126</b><i>b</i>. A canister handle <b>219</b> is attached to the canister <b>210</b>. While the canister arms <b>217</b><i>a </i>and <b>217</b><i>b </i>securely hold the receptacles <b>100</b><i>a </i>and <b>100</b><i>b</i>, a user may lift the canister, or canister handle <b>219</b>, thereby lifting the receptacles <b>100</b><i>a </i>and <b>100</b><i>b</i>, the stands <b>102</b><i>a </i>and <b>102</b><i>b</i>, releasably attached to the receptacles, and the drinking vessels <b>126</b><i>a </i>and <b>126</b><i>b </i>held by the receptacles <b>100</b><i>a </i>and <b>100</b><i>b</i>. The system therefore allows a user to carry multiple receptacles, stands, drinking vessels, and a bottle. The system may include canister arms that releasably attach to stands or receptacles to securely hold the stands and receptacles. Canister arms may attach to stands by mating parts such as a pin and hole, magnets, a hinge, joint, or any other attachment mechanism. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>11</b>B</figref> shows the system while the canister arms <b>217</b><i>a </i>and <b>217</b><i>b </i>are not holding the stands <b>102</b><i>a </i>and <b>102</b><i>b </i>and receptacles <b>100</b><i>a </i>and <b>100</b><i>b</i>. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>11</b>C</figref> shows the system of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>11</b>B</figref>, while the canister arms <b>217</b><i>a </i>and <b>217</b><i>b </i>are holding the stands <b>102</b><i>a </i>and <b>102</b><i>b </i>and receptacles <b>100</b><i>a </i>and <b>100</b><i>b</i>. Stand <b>102</b><i>c </i>and receptacle <b>100</b><i>c </i>are being held by a canister arm that is not viewable. By lifting the canister handle <b>219</b>, the user may carry the system and drinking vessels <b>126</b><i>a</i>, <b>126</b><i>b</i>, and <b>126</b><i>c </i>held by the system.</p>
<p id="p-0107" num="0106">Drinks are often enjoyed out of stemless drinking vessels such as whiskey glasses or stemless wine glasses. Like drinks poured into stemmed drinking vessels, drinks poured into stemless drinking vessels are often poured such that the entire drinking vessel is not fully filled. For example, wine and whiskey are commonly poured to fill less than the entire drinking vessel or less than two-thirds, less than half, or less than a third of the drinking vessel. Filling less than the entire drinking vessel allows a user to swirl the drink in the glass, so that the user may better smell the complex aromas of the drink. Additionally, filling the drinking vessel with less drinking fluid exposes the drink to more oxygen and may thereby develop the flavor of the drink. In an exemplary system, the system may be used to hold stemless drinking vessels and contact a bottom portion of the drinking vessel to allow for efficient temperature control and maintenance, while still enabling viewing of the drinking vessel, the drink within, or both. The system may include a receptacle that shrouds a bottom portion of the drinking vessel where some, most, or all of the drink is likely to be contained. The system may also shroud most or all of the drinking vessel. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>12</b>A</figref> depicts an exemplary system, with the receptacle <b>216</b> defining a recess <b>218</b> and holding drinking vessel <b>220</b>. Drinking vessel <b>220</b> is a stemless wine glass. The receptacle <b>216</b> is shown shrouding and contacting a bottom portion of the drinking vessel <b>220</b> where the drink is most likely to be contained. The system still allows the drinking vessel <b>220</b> to be viewed, or additionally allows a portion or all of the drink contained within to be viewed, thereby enhancing the user's enjoyment of the drink. The greater area of contact with the bottom portion of the drinking vessel <b>220</b> where the drink is contained allows for better thermal conduction and thereby better temperature control and maintenance. The receptacle <b>216</b> has a top end portion <b>222</b>, a bottom end portion <b>224</b>, an inner wall portion <b>226</b>, and an outer wall portion <b>228</b>. The top end portion <b>222</b> is shown defining a top opening <b>230</b> of the recess <b>218</b>. The receptacle <b>216</b> is shown standing upright without a stand. The receptacle <b>216</b> includes a bottom opening <b>221</b>. The bottom opening <b>221</b> allows condensation to drip through the opening instead of pooling in the bottom of the receptacle <b>216</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0108" num="0107">The receptacle <b>216</b> may hold many differently shaped drinking vessels. The system may include any other feature. For example, the system may include an inner cavity, a multivessel contour, both, or additionally or alternatively any one or more of other features as described elsewhere in this disclosure. A receptacle, while shown without a side opening in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>12</b>A</figref>, may include a side opening. The receptacle <b>216</b> may also releasably attach to a stand.</p>

<p id="p-0110" num="0109">Disclosed herein are methods to control a temperature of a drink. The methods allow for better enjoyment of the drink by the user by enabling viewing of the drink, saving space, and efficiently controlling the drink's temperature. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>13</b></figref> is a flow chart of an exemplary method for controlling the temperature of a drink. The method may use components and systems as described elsewhere in this disclosure. For example, the method may use the receptacle, stand, receptacle and stand, or system as described with respect to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b>A through <b>12</b>B</figref>. After starting the controlling of the temperature at step <b>900</b>, the method includes enclosing a liquid solution in an inner cavity of a receptacle at step <b>901</b>. Enclosing a solution allows for better and longer thermal transfer. The method includes selecting whether a warm or cool drink is desired at step <b>902</b>. If a warm drink is selected, the method includes placing a receptacle at a heating environment at step <b>903</b>. The heating environment may be any environment where the temperature is above room temperature, such as an oven, microwave, or heat lamp. The method includes removing the receptacle from the heating environment at step <b>904</b>. If a cool drink is selected, the method includes placing a receptacle at a cooling environment at step <b>905</b>. The cooling environment may be any environment where the temperature is below room temperature, such as a freezer or refrigerator. The method includes removing the receptacle from the cooling environment at step <b>906</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0111" num="0110">The method includes attaching the receptacle to a stand at step <b>907</b>. The method includes standing the receptacle upright at step <b>908</b>. The receptacle may be stood at step <b>908</b> by placing a stand releasably attached to the receptacle on a surface. The receptacle may be stood at step <b>908</b> by standing the receptacle upright without a stand on a supporting surface such as a tabletop or the ground outdoors. The receptacle may be stood at step <b>908</b> by inserting into the earth a stand with a pointed end releasably attached to the receptacle. The method includes pouring a drink into a drinking vessel at step <b>909</b>. The method includes placing the drinking vessel into a recess defined by the receptacle at step <b>910</b>. The method may additionally include fine-tuning the temperature of the drink. For example, the method may include lifting the drinking vessel from the recess defined by the receptacle so as to let the drink warm or cool slightly. The method includes ending the controlling of the temperature at step <b>911</b>.</p>

For example, the inner cavity <b>1770</b> may carry and contain a liquid solution. When placed in the freezer, the liquid solution may freeze, thereby increasing the time and degree of drink temperature control and maintenance.</p>
<p id="p-0131" num="0130">The inner cavity <b>1770</b> can be defined between the inner wall portion <b>1422</b> and the inner surface <b>1502</b> of the inner cavity <b>1770</b>, and between the top end portion <b>1426</b> and bottom end portion <b>1430</b>. The inner cavity <b>1770</b> may contain and carry air or gasses. The inner cavity <b>1770</b> may include an evacuated chamber. The evacuated chamber in the inner cavity <b>1770</b> may have a pressure less than 600 Torr, less than 10<sup>&#x2212;1 </sup>Torr, less than 10<sup>&#x2212;2 </sup>Torr, less than 10<sup>&#x2212;3 </sup>Torr, or less than 10<sup>&#x2212;4 </sup>Torr.
