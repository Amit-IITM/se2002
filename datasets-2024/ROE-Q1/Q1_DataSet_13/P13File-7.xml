<p id="p-0003" num="0002">The present disclosure relates to articles of manufacture, formulations, and methods for printing edible ink images (e.g. multi-color) on an edible substrate such as a foamed beverage.</p>
<heading id="h-0003" level="1">BACKGROUND</heading>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">Digital Images, Ink Images and Dots of Ink Images (with Reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>1</b>A-<b>1</b>B</figref>)</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">In the art of ink-jet printing, it is known to print digital images (e.g. a two-dimensional array of numbers stored in computer-memory) into ink-images. Examples of digital images are binary digital images (e.g. each position in the two-dimensional array has a single bit of data), gray-scale digital images and color digital images.</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">The simple case of printing a binary digital image is shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>1</b>A-<b>1</b>B</figref>. If an &#x201c;x&#x201d; appears at a given pixel location of the digital image, a droplet of ink is deposited via an ink-jet nozzle into a corresponding position on target substrate (e.g. fibrous substrate such as white paper). Each droplet of ink produces a dot at the target location. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b>B</figref> shows 8 dots of an ink-image on substrate, each dot corresponding to a pixel position of the digital image.</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b>B</figref> shows individual dots and is a simplified example. Typically, for 300 dpi or 600 dpi the dots have diameter of up to tens of microns, and individual dots can only be viewed under magnification.</p>
<p id="p-0008" num="0000">Multi-Color Ink Images (with Reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>2</b>-<b>3</b>, <b>4</b>A-<b>4</b>B, <b>5</b> and <b>6</b>A-<b>6</b>B</figref>)</p>
<p id="p-0009" num="0007"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>2</b>-<b>3</b>, <b>4</b>A-<b>4</b>B and <b>5</b></figref> relate to a &#x201c;first multi-color prior art example&#x201d; which is discussed below. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>6</b>A-<b>6</b>B</figref> relate to a &#x201c;second multi-color prior art example,&#x201d; which is discussed below.</p>
<p id="p-0010" num="0008">Color printing, and color ink-jet printing in particular, is ubiquitous in modern life. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref> (PRIOR ART) illustrates a standard color cyan, magenta, yellow, and key (black) (CYMK) ink cartridge assembly having four reservoirs of ink, each one having ink of a different respective color&#x2014;i,e. cyan, magenta, yellow, and key (black).</p>
<p id="p-0011" num="0009">A colour gamut is the range of possible colours that can be displayed or produced/printed. The larger the gamut, the larger the range of colours. For a standard CYMK ink cartridge assembly, it is possible to increase the color gamut beyond these four colors by: (i) layering or overlaying droplets over different colors to &#x2018;mixing&#x2019; between the colors (i.e. primary colors can produce secondary colors); and/or (ii) employing half-toning techniques.</p>
<p id="p-0012" num="0010">As stated in Wikipedia:
<ul id="ul0001" list-style="none">
    <li id="ul0001-0001" num="0000">
    <ul id="ul0002" list-style="none">
        <li id="ul0002-0001" num="0011">Without halftoning, the three military process colors could be printed only as solid blocks of color, and therefore could produce only seven colors: the three primaries themselves, plus three secondary colors produced by layering two of the primaries: cyan and yellow produce green, cyan and magenta produce blue, yellow and magenta produce red (these subtractive secondary colors correspond roughly to the additive primary colors), plus layering all three of them resulting in black. With halftoning, a full continuous range of colors can be produced.</li>
    </ul>
    </li>
</ul>
</p>
<p id="p-0013" num="0012">FIGS. (PRIOR ART) respectively illustrates first and second binary digital (i.e. stored in computer memory) to be ink-jet printed according to the &#x201c;first multi-color prior art example&#x201d;. The binary digital image is an array of pixels, where each pixel corresponds to a dot location in the ink-image to be ink-jet printed (e.g. each pixel may correspond to a different nozzle-location for a two-dimensional array of nozzles of an ink-jet printhead).</p>
<p id="p-0014" num="0013">In the example of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>4</b>A-<b>4</b>B</figref> (i.e. according to the &#x201c;first multi-color prior art example&#x201d;), it is intended to ink-jet print the first digital image using an ink of a first color (e.g. cyan) and to subsequently ink-jet print the second digital image using ink of a second color (e.g. magenta), to produce a multi-color ink image. In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>4</b>A-<b>4</b>B</figref> the first color is schematically represented using a &#x201c;vertical-lines&#x201d; shading-scheme and the second color is schematically represented using &#x201c;horizontal-lines&#x201d; shading-scheme.</p>
<p id="p-0015" num="0014">In many ink-jet systems, the multi-color image is printed sequentially, one ink-color at a time&#x2014;i.e. during a first pass a first digital image is printed from using ink of a first color from a first reservoir (e.g. using a first ink-jet cartridge, or a first compartment of a common cartridge), and during a subsequent second pass a second digital image is printed using ink of a second color from a second reservoir (e.g. using a second ink-jet cartridge, or a second compartment of a common cartridge). <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>34</b></figref> shows the multi-color image that is partially formed according to the &#x201c;first multi-color prior art example&#x201d;&#x2014;i.e. after the first pass, a monochrome image of the first color is produced&#x2014;in the simple example of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b>A</figref>, this image includes 8 dots of the first color. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b>B</figref> shows the multi-color ink-image that is complete&#x2014;i.e. after the second pass.</p>
<p id="p-0016" num="0015"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b>B</figref> illustrates 12 dots according to the &#x201c;first multi-color prior art example&#x201d;&#x2014;(i) in the upper left corner, four dots of the first color (e.g. primary color such as cyan); (ii) in the bottom right corner, four dots of the first color (e.g. primary color such as cyan); and (iii) in the center, four dots of a color mix of the first and second colors (e.g. a secondary color such as blue).</p>
<p id="p-0017" num="0016">Typically, in order to achieve this color mix (e.g. the four dots in the center), the dots of the second color are layered over the dots of the first color. In this example, four dots of the second color are aimed to the same positions as four dots of the first color, and overlay them. This is one example of &#x201c;print registration.&#x201d;</p>
<p id="p-0018" num="0017"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b>A-<b>4</b>B</figref> show individual dots and is a simplified example. Typically, for 300 dpi or 600 dpi the dots have diameter of up to tens of microns, and individual dots can only be viewed under magnification. Thus, the individual dots of the ink images of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>4</b>A-<b>4</b>B</figref> would typically be only visible as individual dots under magnification.</p>
<p id="p-0019" num="0018"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b></figref> shows the multi-color same ink-image as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b>B</figref>, but without the magnification (assuming that each area has more than four dots)&#x2014;i.e. as visible to the naked eye.</p>
<p id="p-0020" num="0019">In the example of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b></figref>, the regional colors of the first, second and third regions correspond to the individual dot colors of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b>B</figref>&#x2014;it might be, however, a respective lighter shade if the density (e.g. derived by relation between dot diameter and distance between neighboring dots) of dots in the first, second or third region is relatively &#x201c;low.&#x201d;</p>
<p id="p-0021" num="0020">Thus, in the first multi-color prior-art example of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>2</b>-<b>3</b>, <b>4</b>A-<b>4</b>B and <b>5</b></figref> (i.e. where there is no half-toning, only overlay of individual ink-dots), if the first color is cyan, and if the second color is magenta, and then the third color is blue. This refers to the &#x2018;dot color&#x2019; of individual dots in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b>B</figref> (magnified image where individual dots are visible).</p>
<p id="p-0022" num="0021">If, however, the density of dots is low in the second region, then the &#x2018;region color&#x2019; of a region (i.e. naked-eye visible) is a lighter shade of the &#x2018;dot color of the individual dots&#x2019; in the region. For example, with reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>4</b>B and <b>5</b></figref> and the example of the previous paragraph, (i) if the dot density of the first region is sparse, then the dot color in the first region is cyan and the region color is &#x2018;light cyan&#x2019;; (ii) if the dot density of the third region is sparse, then the dot color in the third region is magenta and the region color of the third region is &#x2018;light magenta&#x2019;; (iii) if the dot density of the second region is sparse, then the dot color in the second region is blue (i.e. due to the overlay between the cyan and the magenta&#x2014;this is their secondary color) and the region color is &#x2018;light blue.&#x2019;</p>
<p id="p-0023" num="0022">For the present disclosure, we distinguish between the &#x2018;dot color&#x2019; of individual dots of an ink-jet image (i.e. viewable under magnification), and a &#x2018;multi-dot&#x2019; regional color of a region (ie. make up for many dots) of an ink image where the region is viewable by the naked eye.</p>
<p id="p-0024" num="0023"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>6</b>A-<b>6</b>B</figref> show a different example&#x2014;in this case, dots of both the second and third color are present in the &#x2018;second region&#x2019; (i.e. according to any halftoning scheme). The region color (see <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>6</b>B</figref>) of the second region (i.e. viewable to the naked eye) is an optical blend dot colors present in the second region. For example, if the first second and third colors are respectively cyan, magenta and blue, then the regional color of the second region of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>6</b>B</figref> might be a bright purple as an optical blend (i.e. due to half-toning) between cyan and blue.</p>
<p id="p-0025" num="0024">Thus, in simple prior-art example of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>6</b>A-<b>6</b>B</figref>, all individual dots in the second region are either blue (i.e. the third color&#x2014;due to overlay between droplets or dots of cyan and magenta) or magenta (i.e. the second color)&#x2014;these individual dots are viewable under magnification. The naked-eye visible second region, however, has a bright purple region color.</p>
<p id="p-0026" num="0025">The prior art does teach creating new colors by combining multiple colors.</p>
<p id="p-0027" num="0000">Color Wheel (with References to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>7</b>A-<b>7</b>B</figref>)</p>
<p id="p-0028" num="0026">Color wheels illustrate an organized set of color hues around a circle. Isaac Newton, in his 1704 treatise Optiks, relate to a &#x201c;color circle&#x201d; to describe relations between these colors. Since that time, many color wheels and color circles have been presented in the literature. Some color wheels are based on an RYB color model using red, yellow and blue primaries. Some color wheels are based on opponent processes colors (red, yellow blue and green). Some color wheels are based on RGB(red, green, blue) additive primaries.</p>
<p id="p-0029" num="0027">For the present disclosure, the specific 12-color color wheel show in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>7</b></figref> will be used to describe colors and transformations between colors (listed in clockwise order, from 12 o'clock): (i) yellow-green, (ii) green, (iii) blue-green, (iv) blue, (v) blue-violet, (vi) violet, (vii) red-violet, (viii) red, (ix) red-orange, (x) orange, (xi) yellow-orange, and (xii) yellow.</p>
<p id="p-0030" num="0028"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>7</b>B</figref> is a table of RGB values for each of the 12 colors. The color yellow-green is given a position value of &#x201c;1,&#x201d; the color green is given a position value of &#x201c;2,&#x201d; the color blue-green is given a position value of &#x201c;3,&#x201d; and so on.</p>
<heading id="h-0004" level="2">Artificial and Natural Colorants</heading>
<p id="p-0031" num="0029">In recent decades, there is a much greater awareness of the benefits of employing natural ingredients, and in avoiding their artificial counterparts. For the case of artificial colorants in foods, the regulatory authorities generally permit the following colorants: (i) FD&#x26;C Blue No. 1&#x2014;Brilliant Blue FCF, E133 (blue shade), (ii) FD&#x26;C Blue No. 2&#x2014;Indigotine, E132 (indigo shade), (iii) FD&#x26;C Green No. 3&#x2014;Fast Green FCF, E143 (turquoise shade), (iv) FD&#x26;C Red No. 3&#x2014;Erythrosine, E127 (pink shade, commonly used in glace cherries), (v) FD&#x26;C Red No. 40&#x2014;Allura Red AC, E129 (red shade), (vi) FD&#x26;C Yellow No. 5&#x2014;Tartrazine, E102 (yellow shade), (vii) FD&#x26;C Yellow No. 6&#x2014;Sunset Yellow FCF, E110 (orange shade) In many situations, it is more challenging to produce multi-color edible items (or multi-color surfaces thereof) when employing only natural colorants than when artificial colorants are available.</p>

Also, it is to be understood that the phraseology and terminology employed herein is for the purpose of description and should not be regarded as limiting.</p>
<p id="p-0044" num="0134">Some embodiments relate to a printing method comprising the following steps:</p>
<p id="p-0045" num="0135">STEP A: providing a first fluid (e.g. element <b>218</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>8</b>A-<b>8</b>B</figref> or <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>17</b>A-<b>17</b>B</figref>, discussed below) and a second fluid (e.g. element <b>220</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>8</b>A-<b>8</b>B</figref> or element <b>230</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>17</b>A-<b>17</b>B</figref>, or a version thereof that includes riboflavin or riboflavin phosphate) wherein:

        <li id="ul0020-0001" num="0136">i. the first fluid is an acidic edible and aqueous ink whose color is pH sensitive, a primary colorant of the first fluid being anthocyanin-containing concentrate of anthocyanin-containing plant matter (ACC-ACPM), or solids of the ACC-ACPM;</li>
        <li id="ul0020-0002" num="0137">ii. the second fluid is an edible pH-adjusting liquid which is clear, or whose primary colorant is riboflavin or riboflavin-phosphate; and</li>

</p>
<p id="p-0046" num="0138">STEP B. in accordance with a relationship between: (i) a pH-color dependency of the first fluid (see, for example <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>10</b></figref>); and (ii) a pH:mixing-ratio dependency of pH upon a mixing ratio between the first and second fluids (see, for example, any of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>11</b>-<b>11</b>A-<b>11</b>C</figref>), ink-jetting droplets of both the first and second fluids to an edible substrate to print a multi-color edible ink-image thereon.</p>
<p id="p-0047" num="0139">One purpose of the &#x201c;pH adjusting liquid&#x201d; is to modify pH. In some embodiments, a pH of the pH adjusting liquid differs from that of the first fluid. Alternatively or additionally, a pH of the pH adjusting liquid differs from an upper surface of the substrate. Alternatively or additionally, a pH of the pH adjusting liquid differs from the a combination of the first fluid and upper surface of the substrate (e.g. after contact therebetween).</p>
<p id="p-0048" num="0140">Before discussing this method in greater details, an overview is now provided.</p>
<p id="p-0049" num="0141">Producing a Multi-Color Image by Ink-Jetting Two Fluids, Only One of which is Colored</p>
<p id="p-0050" num="0142">Embodiments of the present invention relate to printing an edible image using an edible ink (e.g. first fluid <b>218</b>) comprising an anthocyanin-containing concentrate of anthocyanin-containing plant matter (ACC-ACPM) (or solids of the ACC-ACPM). One example of anthocyanin-containing plant matter (CC-ACPM) is red cabbage. In embodiments of the invention, a primary colorant of the edible ink (e.g first fluid <b>218</b>) is the ACC-ACPM or solids thereof.</p>
<p id="p-0051" num="0143">Embodiments of the invention relate to producing, by ink-jet droplet-deposition, a multi-color image using two fluids (e.g. only two fluids), both of which are ink-jettable but only one of which is colored. The first fluid is an acidic edible ink whose specific color depends on pH (e.g. a primary colorant is the first fluid is extract of anthocyanin-containing plant matter&#x2014;for example, red cabbage extract or solids thereof), while the second fluid is a clear fluid whose purpose is to modify in-situ (i.e. on the surface of the substrate) respective local pH of individuals droplets (or ink-dots formed therefrom) of the first fluid.</p>
<p id="p-0052" num="0144">For edible inks (i e first fluid) whose primary colorant is red cabbage extract (see the section below, entitled &#x201c;Example First Fluid Formulation Used to Print the Multi-Color Image of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>9</b></figref>&#x201d;), a pH dependence of color of the first ink may be described as follows: (i) at a pH value of around 3, a color of the &#x201c;first fluid&#x201d; is red; (ii) at a pH value of around 6, a color of the ink is violet, and (iii) at a pH value of around 8 the ink is blue, and for pH values of around 9 the ink is green. See, for example, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>10</b></figref> discussed below.</p>
<p id="p-0053" num="0145">In one example, droplets of a first fluid whose primary colorant is red cabbage extract are deposited onto the surface of a target substrate which is of uniform pH (i.e. a pH-homogeneous surface) to form a monochrome image of a first color. Subsequently, droplets of the second fluid (i.e. the base&#x2014;e.g. a viscosity thereof is at least 2.5 centipoise (cp)) are deposited (e.g. by ink-jet) directly onto only some of the ink-dots of this monochrome image (one droplet of the second fluid, per ink-dot) to convert this pre-existing monochrome image into a multi-color image.</p>
<p id="p-0054" num="0146">The-ink dots where no second fluid is deposited remain the first color. For the ink-dots where the second fluid is deposited, two things occurs: (i) a pH of each ink-dot is increased in situ (i.e. on the substrate surface) when the droplet of the second fluid (i.e. the base) mixes with each of these ink dots; and (ii) a color of the ink-dot changes in-situ from a first color to a second color.</p>
<p id="p-0055" num="0147">In one specific case, (i) the first fluid is FORMULATION_A (see below&#x2014;&#x201c;Example First Fluid Formulation Used to Print the Multi-Color Image of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>9</b></figref>&#x201d;); (ii) a local pH of dots of the monochrome image is 3.1; (iii) the first color is read; (iv) a local pH of the ink-dots where the second fluid is deposited is 8; and (v) the second color is blue.</p>
<p id="p-0056" num="0148">Thus, it is possible to generate multi-color images (i.e. comprising red and blue dots) not by depositing inks of different colors, but rather by in situ conversion of a proper sub-set of ink-dots already on the substrate from a first color to a second color. This in situ conversation may be performed by converting an acidic form of anthocyanin molecules to neutral or basic forms thereof, or (in other examples) vice versa.</p>
<p id="p-0057" num="0149">The term in situ conversion by the second fluid refers to one of the following: (i) converting a pH and/or color of a pre-existing ink-dot formed by the first fluid by subsequent mixing of this ink-dot with the second fluid (e.g. subsequent overlay with droplet(s) of the second fluid)&#x2014;e.g. as discussed above; and (ii) first depositing droplets of the second fluid, so that upon landing on location where the droplet(s) of the second fluid were deposited, a pH (and thus color) of the first fluid changes due to the pre-existing presence of the first fluid.</p>
<p id="p-0058" num="0150">One salient feature of the multi-color image described above is the following&#x2014;even though the substrate surface is pH-homogeneous (i.e. the &#x2018;background surface&#x2019; upon which the multi-color image resides), the multi-color image is pH-heterogenous. In this example: in the red-regions of the multi-color image, a local pH is about 3, and in the blue regions of the multi-color image, a local pH of about 8.</p>
<p id="p-0059" num="0151"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>9</b></figref> shows one example of such a multi-color image.</p>
<p id="p-0060" num="0152">A Discussion of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>8</b>A-<b>8</b>B and <b>9</b></figref></p>

In a non-limiting example, the reservoirs are part of a multi-reservoir ink-jet cartridge array where a cartridge array refers to one or more ink cartridges. In one example, reservoir <b>198</b>A is a reservoir of a first ink-jet cartridge and reservoir <b>198</b>B is a reservoir of a second ink-jet cartridge. In another example, reservoirs <b>198</b>A and <b>198</b>B are different reservoirs of a single ink-jet cartridge.</p>
<p id="p-0062" num="0154">The ink-jet cartridge may be bubble jet (thermal ink-jet) or piezo.</p>
<p id="p-0063" num="0155">The ink-jet deposition of droplets <b>268</b>, <b>270</b> is controlled, for example, by electronic circuitry <b>170</b> which prints a digital image <b>178</b> (e.g. a color digital image) in accordance with a combination of: (A) a pH-color dependency of the first fluid <b>198</b>A (see, for example, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>10</b></figref> discussed below) and (B) a pH:mixing-ratio dependency of pH upon a mixing ratio between the first and second fluids (see, for example, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>11</b>A-<b>11</b>C</figref> discussed below).</p>
<p id="p-0064" num="0156">The result of the droplet deposition is a multi-color edible ink-image <b>140</b> disposed on target substrate <b>160</b>.</p>

<p id="p-0066" num="0158">In this use-case, a multi-color edible ink-image <b>140</b> having both red and blue regions is formed onto beer foam (i.e. an example of <b>160</b>) from the first <b>218</b> and second <b>220</b> fluids which respectively are disposed in first <b>198</b>A and second <b>198</b>B reservoirs. According to this non-limiting use-case, the multi-color edible ink-image <b>160</b> comprises first and second regions which are respectively red and blue, and the multi-color edible ink-image <b>160</b> is produced as follows:

In particular, since a pH of the beer foam (i.e. an example of <b>160</b>) is around 4 and since a pH of the first fluid <b>218</b> is around 3, all dots within the first region are at a sub-4 pH and are red. Because all individual dots of the first region are individually red, a visible-eye color of the first region of image <b>160</b> is red;</li>
        <li id="ul0022-0002" num="0160">(ii) within the second region of the multi-color ink-image <b>160</b>, registration between droplets of the first and second fluid (i.e. performed by electronic circuitry <b>170</b>&#x2014;for example, controller <b>174</b> thereof) is employed to produce dots which are each individually blue. In particular registration between the deposition of droplets <b>268</b>, <b>270</b> of the first <b>218</b> and second <b>220</b> fluids is employed so that droplets <b>270</b> of the second fluid <b>220</b> are deposited directly onto (i.e. overlay) dots formed from previously-deposited droplets <b>268</b> of the first fluid <b>218</b>. This registration may be useful enable fast mixing between the first and second fluids and/or to control (or localize) such mixing, for example, to produce &#x2018;sharp&#x2019; images.</li>

<p id="p-0099" num="0213">When two different fluids are mixed with each other, the pH of the mixture may depend upon the environment where they are mixed with each other.</p>
<p id="p-0100" num="0214">For example, when droplets of the two different fluids are mixed with each other and the mixing occurs on a substrate (i.e. on a surface of the substrate), the pH of the mixture of droplets may depend on pH of the substrate where the mixing occurs. Furthermore, the pH of the resulting mixture might depend on additional properties of the substrate's&#x2014;for example, whether or not the surface is solid or liquid or foam (and a type of gas of the foam). Alternatively or additionally, thereof or might depend other the absolute volume of each fluid to be mixed (e.g. small droplets might be subject to greater evaporation than larger droplets, and if the vapor pressure of one fluid whose pH is a first value differs from a vapor pressure of the second fluid).</p>
<p id="p-0101" num="0215">The present inventor has performed experiments where droplets (e.g. having a volume of about 45 pico-liters) of the deposited, by ink-jetting, onto a common location for two types of foamed surfaces&#x2014;(i) a beer surface whose pH is 4 and (ii) a milk surface whose pH is 8.</p>
<p id="p-0102" num="0216">To obtain a &#x2018;mixing ratio&#x2019; of 0, only a single droplet was deposited (i.e. of the first fluid). To obtain a &#x2018;mixing ratio&#x2019; of 1, a single droplet of the first fluid and a single droplet of the second fluid were deposited to a common location (i.e. droplet overlay)&#x2014;this common location was the upper surface of a foamed beverage. To obtain a &#x2018;mixing ratio&#x2019; of 2, a single droplet of the first fluid and two droplets of the second fluid were deposited to a common location (i.e. droplet overlay)&#x2014;this common location was the upper surface of a foamed beverage.</p>
<p id="p-0103" num="0217">pH was measured using a surface pH meter MRC-MP-<b>103</b> Flat surface Ph electrode&#x2014;i.e. an electrode of the surface pH meter was put into contact with the droplet/fluid mixture.</p>
<p id="p-0104" num="0218">The results (once again, for FORMULATION_A and FORMULATION_B) are shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>11</b>B-<b>11</b>C</figref>. Comparing the two graphs, the following may be observed: (i) the pH values are generally higher when the droplets are mixed on an alkaline surface (i.e. foamed milk at pH of 8&#x2014;see <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>11</b>C</figref>) than when the droplets are mixed on an acidic surface (i.e. beer at pH of 4).</p>
<p id="p-0105" num="0219">One note about <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>11</b>C</figref>&#x2014;for a mixing ratio of 2, a pH value is 9, corresponding to blue-green for FORMULATION_A. This pH value exceeds (i) a pH of FORMULATION_A (about 3), which is acidic; (ii) a pH of the milk surface (around 8) and (iii) a pH of FORMULATION_B (about 7.6).</p>
<p id="p-0106" num="0220">Not wishing to be bound by theory, the inventor believes that this surprisingly high pH value is achievable due to a chemical and/or physical process which occurs in the foam disposed on the top of a milk-beverage.</p>

<p id="p-0116" num="0230">Embodiments of the present invention relate to methods and apparatus for creating specific color patterns where multiple colors of the may be &#x2018;targeted&#x2019;&#x2014;i.e. to enforce a &#x2018;multi-color directive&#x2019; that requires the targeting of multiple and different colors for appearance in an ink-image.

<p id="p-0117" num="0231">When a color of an ink image is &#x2018;targeted&#x2019; for the ink-image (e.g. in the context of a multi-color directive), this refers to one of (A) printing relative quantities or locations of each fluid of a plurality of fluids (e.g. first <b>218</b> and second <b>220</b> fluids) so that the &#x2018;targeted&#x2019; color appears in the ink-image (OPTION A) or (B) regulating droplet-deposition of relative quantities or locations of first and second fluid so as to minimize a color-difference between:

<p id="p-0119" num="0235">In the prior art, such a directive (i.e. to achieve specific dot-colors) would be enforced by the right combination of cyan, magenta, yellow, and key (black)&#x2014;i.e. droplets multiple colorants (e.g. dyes) would be delivered to a common pixel-locations (i.e. using overlay to form secondary colorants) and/or enforced using halftoning techniques.</p>
<p id="p-0120" num="0236">In contrast, in embodiments of the invention, it is possible to produce an ink-image using a single dye-molecule (i.e. anthocyanin&#x2014;as provided, for example, by red-cabbage extract or extract of any other anthocyanin-containing plant(s)) whose color depends on pH (e.g. red for the acidic form of the dye-molecule, and blue or green of the basic form thereof.</p>
<p id="p-0121" num="0237">One way of &#x2018;targeting a color&#x2019; is by first generating (e.g. by a digital computer or any other electronic circuitry and/or executing software code) digital images (i.e. stored in computer memory) in accordance with a combination of pH-related factors, and then printing these digital images (e.g. a first digital image is printed in B/W using the first fluid, and a second digital image is printed in B/W, according to registration techniques for droplet-overlay, using the second fluid).</p>

        <li id="ul0038-0002" num="0252">(ii) subsequently, a color-profile of this intermediate ink-image is modified by modifying a pH profile thereof to produce a pH heterogenous (i.e. with respect to its ink-dots) image.

<p id="p-0134" num="0254">Not wishing to be bound by theory, it is now disclosed that the embodiments of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>8</b>A-<b>8</b>B</figref> are useful for situations where it is desired to print an edible ink-image on edible substrate (i) that includes specific color-combinations (e.g. an ink-image including both red and blue pixels and/or includes both red and green pixels and/or includes both violet and green pixels) and (ii) in a manner that avoids as much as possible (e.g. completely), the use of artificial colorants and while relying on natural colorants.</p>
<p id="p-0135" num="0255">The inventor has found that inks based on anthocyanins-containing plant concentrate (e.g. red cabbage concentrate) is useful as a first fluid <b>218</b>. In the example of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>8</b>A-<b>8</b>B, <b>9</b>, <b>11</b>B and <b>12</b>A-<b>12</b>D</figref>, the target substrate is acidic. In order to convert the red color of the anthocyanins-containing plant concentrate into blue or green (e.g. to produce an ink-image including both red and blue and/or both red and green), the inks based on anthocyanins-containing plant concentrate is mixed in situ (i.e. on the surface) with droplets of a base fluid, as the second fluid <b>220</b>. This is because droplets of the first fluid would not reach the request pH to produce blue and/or green without being mixed with a fluid of higher pH.</p>
<p id="p-0136" num="0256">When printing on a surface (e g milk-foam) that is alkaline, an alternative approach may be adopted (or combined with the previous approach).</p>
<p id="p-0137" num="0257">Review of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>10</b> and <b>11</b>C</figref> shows that for a mixing ratio of &#x201c;zero&#x201d;, a pH of the first fluid is about 5.5 and a color thereof is violet or red-violet. Thus, even though the ink itself is red, it would be challenging or impossible to obtain red-dots on the milk-foam surface using only the arrangements of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>8</b>A-<b>8</b>B</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0138" num="0258"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>17</b>A-<b>17</b>B</figref> provide an alternative. Instead (or in addition to) of ink-jetting droplets of a clear base fluid <b>220</b> (see <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>8</b>A</figref>), the purpose of which is to raise the pH of the first fluid and to modify a color thereof (e.g. by modifying, in situ, a pH of droplets of the first fluid or an ink-dot thereof) in a counterclockwise direction in the 12-Color Color-wheel of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>7</b>A-<b>7</b>B</figref> (e.g. from red to violet, or from red to blue, or from red to green), in the example of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>17</b>A-<b>17</b>B</figref>, instead of using a clear base fluid <b>220</b>, a clear acid fluid <b>230</b> is used to modify pH instead.</p>
<p id="p-0139" num="0259">One example formulation for the ink-jettable acid fluid <b>230</b> is Formulation_F, described below.</p>

In one example, (i) the first fluid is an acidic edible and aqueous ink, a primary colorant of the first fluid is an extract of plant matter or solids of the extract of the plant matter; and (ii) a primary colorant of the X:Y (e.g. X=1, Y=1 or X=1, Y=2) mixture of the first and second fluid <b>220</b> (or <b>230</b>) is the extract of plant matter or solids of the extract of the plant matter.

<heading id="h-0013" level="2">Measuring Surface Tension:</heading>
<p id="p-0196" num="0346">The methodology used for measuring surface tension of ink is the Wilhelmy plate Method, The Wilhelmy plate method is a universal method especially suited to check surface tension over time intervals. In short, a vertical plate of known perimeter is attached to a balance, and the force due to wetting is measured. The equipment used and corresponding settings are as follows:</p>
<p id="p-0197" num="0347">Device: Kr&#xfc;ss Tensiometer K20, manufactured by Kr&#xfc;ss GmbH. Plate Dimensions: Width: 19.9 nm Thickness: 0.2 mm, Height: 10 mm.</p>

<heading id="h-0015" level="2">Measuring Light Absorbance</heading>
<p id="p-0200" num="0350">Light absorbance of the solution, is a common measurement technique employed to monitor optical characteristics of samples. The ink samples contain an analyte species dissolved in a solvent at an unknown concentration. The concentration of the analyte in a sample may be determined by using a photometric device to measure the fraction of light absorbed by the sample at a specific wavelength (&#x3bb;). The value of &#x3bb; is usually chosen to be near the wavelength of light where the analyte absorbs maximally. According to the Beer-Lambert law. The value of the ink is measured with a photometric apparatus, such as a photometer or spectrophotometer, equipped with a fixed light path sample-retaining device called a cuvette, such as a 1 cm light absorption pathlength cuvette (10 mm cuvette). The sample-retaining device contains a sample comprised of analyte dissolved in a solvent. The value of I<sub>O </sub>is ordinarily measured with the same system. (photometric apparatus, sample-retaining device and solvent except that no analyte is present in the solvent. Alternatively, I<sub>O </sub>may be measured in the absence of both the sample and the sample-retaining device (this value of I<sub>O </sub>is called an &#x201c;air blank&#x201d;). When an &#x201c;air blank&#x201d; is employed, a separate Ai measurement of the solvent and sample-retaining device gives a &#x201c;solvent blank&#x201d; absorbance value. A &#x201c;corrected absorbance&#x201d; value related to absorbance of the analyte is then obtained by subtracting the &#x201c;solvent blank&#x201d; from each absorbance measurement made on the samples comprised of analyte dissolved in solvent and contained in the sample-retaining device.</p>
<heading id="h-0016" level="2">Particle Size and Particle Size Distribution</heading>
<p id="p-0201" num="0351">Particle size may be determined according to measurement of particle size distributions. Particle size distribution may be measured using DLS (dynamic light scattering techniques). Dynamic light scattering (DLS), sometimes referred to as Quasi Elastic Light Scattering (QELS), is a non-invasive, well-established technique for measuring the size and size distribution of molecules and particles typically in the submicron region. For example, devices for measuring particle size are available from Malvern Panalytical of Malvern (United Kingdom).</p>
