<heading id="h-0002" level="1">FIELD</heading>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">The subject matter described herein relates generally to systems, devices, and methods for improving the accuracy and fault detection of an analyte sensor. In particular, the embodiments described herein involve corroborating data collected by a glucose sensor with data collected from a secondary sensing element, in order to correct a glucose level or to detect a suspected adverse condition, such as a suspected sensor fault.</p>
<heading id="h-0003" level="1">BACKGROUND</heading>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">A vast and growing market exists for monitoring the health and condition of humans and other living animals. Information that describes the physical or physiological condition of humans can be used in countless ways to assist and improve quality of life, and diagnose and treat undesirable human conditions.</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">A common device used to collect such information is a physiological sensor such as a biochemical analyte sensor, or a device capable of sensing a chemical analyte of a biological entity. Biochemical sensors come in many forms and can be used to sense analytes in fluids, tissues, or gases forming part of, or produced by, a biological entity, such as a human being. These analyte sensors can be used on or within the body itself, such as in the case of a transcutaneously implanted analyte sensor, or they can be used on biological substances that have already been removed from the body.</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">Although analyte sensors and analyte monitoring systems often have a complex and well-studied design, they can still be subject to a loss of function prior to the end of their expected life. This can result in an undesirable and unexpected reduction in sensor signal response to actual analyte fluctuations. In many cases, the reduction in signal response of an analyte sensor can cause a false indication of a low analyte level or, in the case of a complete sensor fault, a failure to indicate any analyte level whatsoever. Furthermore, an undesirable and unexpected reduction in signal response of an analyte sensor can trigger false positives with respect to low-threshold alarms, such as low-glucose or hypoglycemia alarms.</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">Another problem that can occur with analyte monitoring systems are &#x201c;night time glucose dropouts,&#x201d; a phenomenon that results in a sudden decrease in a blood glucose level for a short period of time at night while a human wearing an analyte sensor is sleeping. These drops in blood glucose levels can trigger false positives with respect to low-threshold alarms or make unnecessary insulin adjustments when the sensor is used with an automated insulin delivery system.</p>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">For these and other reasons, needs exist for improving the accuracy of analyte sensors, as well as detecting sensor fault conditions.</p>
<heading id="h-0004" level="1">SUMMARY</heading>
<p id="p-0009" num="0008">Example embodiments of systems, devices, and methods are described herein for improving the accuracy of an analyte sensor and for detecting sensor fault conditions. Some embodiments, for example, provide for the detection of suspected glucose dropouts and/or the correction of glucose levels based on glucose level and lactate level measurements and calculations. In some embodiments, a corrective action, such as a lag correction, glucose sensor termination, or glucose sensor data smoothing, can be performed based on a first data indicative of a glucose level and a second data indicative of a secondary physiological measurement, wherein the secondary physiological measurement can comprise, for example, a ketone level or a heart rate measurement. Numerous examples of algorithms and methods for performing combinations and/or variations of one or both of these detection and correction mechanisms are provided, as well as example embodiments of systems and devices for performing the same.</p>
<p id="p-0010" num="0009">Other systems, devices, methods, features and advantages of the subject matter described herein will be or will become apparent to one with skill in the art upon examination of the following figures and detailed description. It is intended that all such additional systems, methods, features and advantages be included within this description, be within the scope of the subject matter described herein, and be protected by the accompanying claims. In no way should the features of the example embodiments be construed as limiting the appended claims, absent express recitation of those features in the claims.</p>

<p id="p-0031" num="0030">A number of embodiments of the present disclosure are designed to improve upon the computer-implemented capabilities of analyte monitoring systems with respect to, for example, the detection of nighttime glucose dropouts, the correction of glucose level measurements, and the early termination of glucose sensors, to name only a few. More specifically, these embodiments can utilize &#x201c;secondary&#x201d; data indicative of non-glucose physiological measurements (e.g., lactate levels, ketone levels, heart rate measurements, etc.) to improve upon the accuracy of in vivo glucose sensors, as well as to determine conditions in which an in vivo glucose sensor can or should be terminated or temporarily masked. Accordingly, the embodiments disclosed herein reflect improvements over prior methods and are directed to systems, devices, and methods that can improve upon the accuracy of analyte monitoring systems by utilizing glucose sensor data combined with non-glucose physiological measurements in a specific and non-conventional way. Other features and advantages of the disclosed embodiments are further discussed below.</p>
<p id="p-0032" num="0031">Before describing the embodiments in detail, however, it is first desirable to describe examples of devices that can be present within, for example, an in vivo analyte monitoring system, as well as examples of their operation, all of which can be used with the embodiments described herein.</p>
<heading id="h-0007" level="2">Example Embodiments of Analyte Monitoring Systems</heading>
<p id="p-0033" num="0032">There are various types of analyte monitoring systems. &#x201c;Continuous Analyte Monitoring&#x201d; systems (or &#x201c;Continuous Glucose Monitoring&#x201d; systems), for example, are in vivo systems that can transmit data from a sensor control device to a reader device repeatedly or continuously without prompting, e.g., automatically according to a schedule. &#x201c;Flash Analyte Monitoring&#x201d; systems (or &#x201c;Flash Glucose Monitoring&#x201d; systems or simply &#x201c;Flash&#x201d; systems), as another example, are in vivo systems that can transfer data from a sensor control device in response to a scan or request for data by a reader device, such as with a Near Field Communication (NFC) or Radio Frequency Identification (RFID) protocol. In vivo analyte monitoring systems can also operate without the need for finger stick calibration.</p>
<p id="p-0034" num="0033">In vivo monitoring systems can include a sensor that, while positioned in vivo, makes contact with the bodily fluid of the user and senses one or more analyte levels contained therein. The sensor can be part of a sensor control device that resides on the body of the user and contains the electronics and power supply that enable and control the analyte sensing. The sensor control device, and variations thereof, can also be referred to as a &#x201c;sensor control unit,&#x201d; an &#x201c;on-body electronics&#x201d; device or unit, an &#x201c;on-body&#x201d; device or unit, or a &#x201c;sensor data communication&#x201d; device or unit, to name a few. As used herein, these terms are not limited to devices with analyte sensors, and encompass devices that have sensors of other types, whether biometric or non-biometric. The term &#x201c;on body&#x201d; refers to any device that resides directly on the body or in close proximity to the body, such as a wearable device (e.g., glasses, watch, wristband or bracelet, neckband or necklace, etc.).</p>
<p id="p-0035" num="0034">In vivo monitoring systems can also include one or more reader devices that receive sensed analyte data from the sensor control device. These reader devices can process and/or display the sensed analyte data, or sensor data, in any number of forms, to the user. These devices, and variations thereof, can be referred to as &#x201c;handheld reader devices,&#x201d; &#x201c;reader devices&#x201d; (or simply, &#x201c;readers&#x201d;), &#x201c;handheld electronics&#x201d; (or handhelds), &#x201c;portable data processing&#x201d; devices or units, &#x201c;data receivers,&#x201d; &#x201c;receiver&#x201d; devices or units (or simply receivers), &#x201c;relay&#x201d; devices or units, or &#x201c;remote&#x201d; devices or units, to name a few. Other devices such as personal computers have also been utilized with or incorporated into in vivo and in vitro monitoring systems.</p>
<p id="p-0036" num="0035">In vivo analyte monitoring systems can be differentiated from &#x201c;in vitro&#x201d; systems that contact a biological sample outside of the body (or rather &#x201c;ex vivo&#x201d;) and that typically include a meter device that has a port for receiving an analyte test strip carrying a bodily fluid of the user, which can be analyzed to determine the user's analyte level. As mentioned, the embodiments described herein can be used with in vivo systems, in vitro systems, and combinations thereof.</p>
<p id="p-0037" num="0036">The embodiments described herein can be used to monitor and/or process information regarding any number of one or more different analytes. Analytes that may be monitored include, but are not limited to, acetyl choline, amylase, bilirubin, cholesterol, chorionic gonadotropin, glycosylated hemoglobin (HbAlc), creatine kinase (e.g., CK-MB), creatine, creatinine, DNA, fructosamine, glucose, glucose derivatives, glutamine, growth hormones, hormones, ketones, ketone bodies, lactate, peroxide, prostate-specific antigen, prothrombin, RNA, thyroid stimulating hormone, and troponin. The concentration of drugs, such as, for example, antibiotics (e.g., gentamicin, vancomycin, and the like), digitoxin, digoxin, drugs of abuse, theophylline, and warfarin, may also be monitored. In embodiments that monitor more than one analyte, the analytes may be monitored at the same or different times.</p>

<p id="p-0041" num="0040">Sensor control device <b>102</b> can include a housing <b>103</b> containing in vivo analyte monitoring circuitry and a power source. In this embodiment, the in vivo analyte monitoring circuitry is electrically coupled with one or more analyte sensors <b>104</b> that extend through an adhesive patch <b>105</b> and projects away from housing <b>103</b>. Adhesive patch <b>105</b> contains an adhesive layer (not shown) for attachment to a skin surface of the body of the user. Other forms of body attachment to the body may be used, in addition to or instead of adhesive.</p>
<p id="p-0042" num="0041">Sensor <b>104</b> is adapted to be at least partially inserted into the body of the user, where it can make fluid contact with that user's bodily fluid (e.g., subcutaneous (subdermal) fluid, dermal fluid, or blood) and be used, along with the in vivo analyte monitoring circuitry, to measure analyte-related data of the user. Sensor <b>104</b> and any accompanying sensor control electronics can be applied to the body in any desired manner. For example, an insertion device <b>150</b> can be used to position all or a portion of analyte sensor <b>104</b> through an external surface of the user's skin and into contact with the user's bodily fluid. In doing so, the insertion device can also position sensor control device <b>102</b> with adhesive patch <b>105</b> onto the skin. In other embodiments, insertion device can position sensor <b>104</b> first, and then accompanying sensor control electronics can be coupled with sensor <b>104</b> afterwards, either manually or with the aid of a mechanical device.

Examples of such drug delivery devices can include medication pumps having a cannula that remains in the body to allow infusion over a multi-hour or multi-day period (e.g., wearable pumps for the delivery of basal and bolus insulin). Reader device <b>120</b>, when combined with a medication pump, can include a reservoir to store the drug, a pump connectable to transfer tubing, and an infusion cannula. The pump can force the drug from the reservoir, through the tubing and into the diabetic's body by way of the cannula inserted therein. Other examples of drug delivery devices that can be included with (or integrated with) reader device <b>120</b> include portable injection devices that pierce the skin only for each delivery and are subsequently removed (e.g., insulin pens). A reader device <b>120</b>, when combined with a portable injection device, can include an injection needle, a cartridge for carrying the drug, an interface for controlling the amount of drug to be delivered, and an actuator to cause injection to occur.

The needle can be replaced after each injection.</p>
<p id="p-0061" num="0060">The combined device can function as part of a closed-loop system (e.g., an artificial pancreas system requiring no user intervention to operate) or semi-closed loop system (e.g., an insulin loop system requiring seldom user intervention to operate, such as to confirm changes in dose). For example, the diabetic's analyte level can be monitored in a repeated automatic fashion by sensor control device <b>102</b>, which can then communicate that monitored analyte level to reader device <b>120</b>, and the appropriate drug dosage to control the diabetic's analyte level can be automatically determined and subsequently delivered to the diabetic's body. Software instructions for controlling the pump and the amount of insulin delivered can be stored in the memory of reader device <b>120</b> and executed by the reader device's processing circuitry. These instructions can also cause calculation of drug delivery amounts and durations (e.g., a bolus infusion and/or a basal infusion profile) based on the analyte level measurements obtained directly or indirectly from sensor control device <b>102</b>. In some embodiments sensor control device <b>102</b> can determine the drug dosage and communicate that to reader device <b>120</b>.</p>

In some embodiments, the second device can transmit a polling signal or data packet to sensor control device <b>102</b>, and device <b>102</b> can treat each poll (or polls occurring at certain time intervals) as a request for data and, if data is available, then can transmit such data to the second device. In many embodiments, the communication between sensor control device <b>102</b> and the second device are secure (e.g., encrypted and/or between authenticated devices), but in some embodiments the data can be transmitted from sensor control device <b>102</b> in an unsecured manner, e.g., as a broadcast to all listening devices in range.</p>

<heading id="h-0011" level="2">Example Characterizations of Glucose and Lactate Levels During Nighttime Glucose Dropouts</heading>
<p id="p-0068" num="0067">Nighttime glucose dropouts are a phenomenon observed with analyte monitoring systems, in which a measured glucose concentration from a glucose sensor can suddenly decrease for a short period of time during the night while the user wearing the glucose sensor is asleep. Nighttime glucose dropouts can trigger false low glucose alarms or cause unnecessary medication delivery adjustments if the analyte monitoring system is used with an automated medication delivery system such as, for example, an automated insulin pump.</p>
<p id="p-0069" num="0068">Previous researchers have theorized that nighttime glucose dropouts are a result of pressure-induced sensor attenuation. However, recent research utilizing dual glucose/lactate sensors (e.g., a glucose sensing element and a lactate sensing element in one analyte sensor) suggests that nighttime glucose dropouts are actually a physiological phenomenon that can cause interstitial glucose concentration to decrease at a particular sensing site. This research also suggests that the physiological phenomenon also causes a lactate concentration to increase concurrently with the decrease in the glucose concentration.</p>

As can be seen from multi-plot graph <b>400</b>, no nighttime glucose dropouts were experienced by the first dual glucose/lactate sensor.</p>
<p id="p-0071" num="0070">Referring next to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b>B</figref>, multi-plot graph <b>410</b> for the second dual glucose/lactate sensor includes upper plot <b>412</b> indicating a glucose concentration over time, and lower plot <b>414</b> indicating a lactate concentration over time. As indicated by the dotted ellipse, the second dual glucose/lactate sensor experienced a glucose dropout around 5:00 AM, which can be characterized by a sharp decrease in glucose concentration at data point <b>418</b> and, concurrently, a sharp increase in lactate concentration at data point <b>416</b>. Apart from the nighttime glucose dropout event, the glucose and lactate concentration trendlines of multi-plot graphs <b>400</b> and <b>410</b> are relatively similar.</p>
<p id="p-0072" num="0071">Based on multi-plot graphs <b>400</b> and <b>410</b>, it can be inferred that both the first and the second dual glucose/lactate sensors functioned properly, but the analytes at the sensing site of the second dual glucose/lactate sensor experienced a nighttime glucose dropout as a result of a physiological change, as reflected in multi-plot graph <b>410</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b>B</figref>.</p>

<p id="p-0075" num="0074">Example embodiments of methods for detecting a suspected glucose dropout in an analyte monitoring system based on glucose and lactate concentration measurements will now be described.

For example, in some embodiments, the collection of data indicative of an analyte level (e.g., glucose, lactate) can be performed on the sensor control device, whereas the calculation of analyte metrics (e.g., glucose derivative values, lactate derivative values) and the comparison of said analyte metrics to predetermined thresholds can be performed on a reader device, remote computing system, or a trusted computing system. In some embodiments, the collection of analyte data and comparison of with predetermined thresholds can be performed solely on the sensor control device. Likewise, those of skill in the art will recognize that the representations of computing devices in the embodiments disclosed herein, such as those shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>, are intended to cover both physical devices and virtual devices (or &#x201c;virtual machines&#x201d;).</p>
<p id="p-0077" num="0076"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b></figref> is a flow diagram of an example embodiment of a method <b>500</b> for detecting a suspected glucose dropout. At Step <b>510</b>, a first data indicative of a glucose level is collected by an analyte sensor, such as those described with respect to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>1</b> and <b>3</b></figref>. At Step <b>520</b>, a second data indicative of a lactate level is collected by a lactate sensing element. According to some embodiments, Steps <b>510</b> and <b>520</b> can be performed by a sensor control unit comprising an analyte sensor having a portion that is configured to be inserted into a user's body at an insertion site, wherein the portion includes a first sensing element configured to sense a glucose level in a bodily fluid and a second sensing element configured to sense a lactate level in the bodily fluid of the same insertion site. In other embodiments, Steps <b>510</b> and <b>520</b> can be performed by a sensor control unit comprising a first analyte sensor and a second analyte sensor, wherein the first analyte sensor is configured to sense a glucose level in a bodily fluid and the second analyte sensor is configured to sense a lactate level in the bodily fluid, and wherein the first and second analyte sensors are configured to sense analyte levels at the same localized site of insertion.</p>
<p id="p-0078" num="0077">Referring still to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b></figref>, at Step <b>530</b>, a first analyte metric based on the first data is calculated and a second analyte metric based on the second data is calculated. According to many of the embodiments, the first analyte metric is a glucose derivative and the second analyte metric is a lactate derivative. At Step <b>540</b>, the first analyte metric is compared with a first threshold and the second analyte metric is compared with a second threshold. According to many of the embodiments, the first threshold can be a predetermined glucose derivative threshold, and the second threshold can be a predetermined lactate derivative threshold. Furthermore, according to some embodiments, the first threshold can be a negative threshold value and the second threshold can be a positive threshold value.</p>
<p id="p-0079" num="0078">At Step <b>550</b>, a determination is made, based on the comparison in previous Step <b>540</b>, as to whether both the first and second thresholds have been met or exceeded. For example, according to some embodiments, the first threshold can be a predetermined negative glucose derivative threshold and the second threshold can be a predetermined positive lactate derivative threshold. In such cases, the first threshold (e.g., predetermined glucose derivative threshold) is met and/or exceeded when the first analyte metric (e.g., glucose derivative) is less than or equal to the first threshold, and the second threshold (e.g., predetermined lactate derivative threshold) is met and/or exceeded when the second analyte metric (e.g., lactate derivative) is greater than or equal to the second threshold.</p>
<p id="p-0080" num="0079">According to another aspect of the embodiments, the determination as to whether the thresholds have been met or exceeded can further include an evaluation of whether the thresholds have been met or exceeded simultaneously or near simultaneously. In some embodiments, for example, the first and second analyte metrics can be derived from analyte level data that is collected in the same time period, such as by use of a sliding window, wherein the sliding window can be defined by a predetermined number of data points (e.g., last five glucose derivative values, last five lactate derivative values), or a predetermined duration of time (e.g., 5, 10, 15 minute windows). In other embodiments, the determination as to whether the thresholds have been met or exceeded can include a comparison of an average glucose derivative value over a first predetermined time period with an average lactate derivative value over a second predetermined time period. Those of skill in the art will recognize that other methods by which to assess whether two analyte level metrics meet or exceed a corresponding threshold can be utilized and are fully within the scope of the present disclosure.</p>
<p id="p-0081" num="0080">Similarly, those of skill in the art will further appreciate that variations for the first and second thresholds can be utilized. In some embodiments, for example, the first and second analyte metric can be, respectively, an absolute value of a glucose derivative and an absolute value of a lactate derivative. Accordingly, the first and second thresholds can also be a predetermined absolute value of a glucose derivative threshold and a predetermined absolute value of a lactate derivative threshold.</p>
<p id="p-0082" num="0081">Referring again to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b></figref>, if both thresholds are not met and/or exceeded, then method <b>500</b> returns to Step <b>510</b>. However, if both thresholds are met and/or exceeded, then at Step <b>560</b>, an indication of a suspected glucose dropout is generated. In some embodiments, the indication of the suspected glucose dropout can comprise a visual output to a display of a reader device, remote computer, or a trusted computer system, such as those described with respect to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>. For example, in some embodiments, generation of an indication of a suspected glucose dropout can result in a notification or message displayed on a sensor results screen of a software application running on a user's mobile device. Similarly, in some embodiments, the indication of a suspected glucose dropout can comprise one or more of a visual, audio, or vibratory alert or alarm that is output to a display of a reader device, remote computer, or trusted computer system. Subsequently, at Step <b>570</b>, a remedial action can be optionally performed in response to, or instead of, the indication of the suspected glucose dropout. In some embodiments, for example, the remedial action can be suppressing a low glucose alarm. In other embodiments, a remedial action can be preventing the issuance of a command to alter or cause the delivery of medication (e.g., insulin) by an automated medication delivery system (e.g., insulin pump).</p>

Furthermore, in some embodiments, the first time period can overlap or fall within the second time period.</p>
<p id="p-0099" num="0101">According to another aspect of the embodiments, the baseline lactate value can be an average lactate value over one or more days (e.g., two days, three days, etc.). In some embodiments, for example, the one or more days can occur during a middle portion of a sensor life of the analyte sensor.</p>
<p id="p-0100" num="0102">Referring still to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>7</b>A</figref>, at Step <b>720</b>, the corrected glucose level can be visually output to a display.

<p id="p-0101" num="0103"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>7</b>B</figref> is a flow diagram depicting an example embodiment of a method <b>750</b> for detecting a suspected sensor fault using lactate level measurements. At Step <b>755</b>, a first data indicative of a glucose level is collected by an analyte sensor, such as those described with respect to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>1</b> and <b>3</b></figref>. At Step <b>760</b>, a second data indicative of a lactate level is collected by a lactate sensing element. According to some embodiments, Steps <b>755</b> and <b>760</b> can be performed by a sensor control unit comprising an analyte sensor having a portion that is configured to be inserted into a user's body at an insertion site, wherein the portion includes a first sensing element configured to sense a glucose level in a bodily fluid and a second sensing element configured to sense a lactate level in the bodily fluid of the same insertion site. In other embodiments, Steps <b>755</b> and <b>760</b> can be performed by a sensor control unit comprising a first analyte sensor and a second analyte sensor, wherein the first analyte sensor is configured to sense a glucose level in a bodily fluid and the second analyte sensor is configured to sense a lactate level in the bodily fluid, and wherein the first and second analyte sensors are configured to sense analyte levels at the same localized site of insertion.</p>
<p id="p-0102" num="0104">Referring still to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>7</b>B</figref>, at Step <b>765</b>, a baseline lactate value is calculated using the second data.

<p id="p-0103" num="0105">Several factors including calibration variation between sensors and temporal variations (such as, e.g., ESA, LSA, and nighttime dropouts) can adversely affect a glucose sensor's low-end performance. In addition, the uncertainty associated with these factors can also limit the amount of lag correction that can be applied to glucose level readings. It would therefore be beneficial to be able to discern between true high/low glucose conditions (e.g., hypoglycemia, hyperglycemia) and false high/low glucose conditions in order to determine an optimal amount of lag correction, to improve sensitivity and specificity of sensor fault detection, and to improve the overall low-end accuracy of the glucose sensor.</p>
<p id="p-0104" num="0106">The increasing adoption of wearable devices capable of quantifying a person's state of health presents an opportunity to leverage information from non-glucose sensors (also referred to as &#x201c;secondary sensors&#x201d;) to improve the low-end performance of glucose sensors. Examples of non-glucose sensors, or &#x201c;secondary&#x201d; sensors, include, but are not limited to, heart rate monitors, insertable cardiac monitors, implantable electrocardiogram (ECG) devices, implantable electroencephalogram (EEG) devices, ketone sensors, continuous ketone monitors, ketone strip readers, to name a few. These non-glucose or &#x201c;secondary&#x201d; sensors can provide secondary physiological measurements that can then be analyzed along with glucose level readings from a glucose sensor to either confirm or contradict a high/low glucose condition detected by the glucose sensor.</p>
<p id="p-0105" num="0107">For example, when blood glucose is in a hyperglycemic range for an extended period of time, it has been demonstrated that ketone levels will gradually increase. Accordingly, ketone level measurements from either strip-based or continuous ketone monitors can be utilized to determine, along with glucose-based fault detection modules, whether a persistent low glucose sensor reading is physiologically likely or not.</p>
<p id="p-0106" num="0108">As another example, when blood glucose is in a hypoglycemic range for an extended period of time, it has been demonstrated that hypoglycemia can have pathophysiological effects on cardiac workload, QT interval, and other factors. Many of these factors (e.g., heart rate, ECG, and EEG) can be measured by wearables and other similar medical devices. For example, research has shown that arrhythmias can occur during hypoglycemia. Similarly, other research has demonstrated the use of EEG to infer hypoglycemia. Accordingly, data from secondary sensors (e.g., heart rate monitors, ECG, EEG, etc.) can be used to confirm true hypoglycemia versus false low glucose conditions.</p>
<p id="p-0107" num="0109">In addition to the benefits described above, fusing secondary physiological measurements from non-glucose or &#x201c;secondary&#x201d; sensors with data from glucose sensors can improve low-end glucose sensor performance in at least two other ways. First, a more aggressive lag correction can be applied at the low end of a glucose range because the likelihood of false low glucose readings (e.g., due to ESA, LSA, or nighttime dropouts) is reduced. Second, non-glucose or &#x201c;secondary&#x201d; physiological measurements can be utilized in conjunction with glucose sensor data to better detect sensor faults in order to either temporarily mask glucose readings, adjust glucose readings, or terminate a glucose sensor early.</p>
<p id="p-0108" num="0110">Before discussing the details of example embodiments of methods for fusing glucose sensor data and secondary sensor data, it is first desirable to describe examples of systems and devices, as well as examples of their operation, which can be used to perform the methods described herein. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>8</b></figref> is a logical diagram depicting one aspect of the example embodiments described herein.

Furthermore, those of skill in the art will appreciate that other secondary sensing elements <b>804</b> (e.g., implantable or insertable heart monitors, lactate sensors, etc.) can be utilized and are fully within the scope of the present disclosure.

<heading id="h-0017" level="2">Example Methods for Improving Glucose Sensor Performance Using Secondary Sensor Data</heading>
<p id="p-0114" num="0116">Example embodiments of methods for improving glucose sensor performance using secondary physiological measurements from a secondary sensing element will now be described. As with previous embodiments, it will be understood by those of skill in the art that any one or more of the steps of the example methods described herein can be stored as software instructions in a non-transitory memory of a sensor control device, a reader device, a remote computer, or a trusted computer system, such as those described with respect to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>. The stored instructions, when executed, can cause the processing circuitry of the associated device or computing system to perform any one or more of the steps of the example methods described herein. It will also be understood by those of skill in the art that, in many of the embodiments, any one or more of the method steps described herein can be performed using real-time or near real-time sensor data. In other embodiments, any one or more of the method steps can be performed retrospectively with respect to stored sensor data, including sensor data from prior sensor wears by the same user. For example, in some embodiments, the method steps described herein can be performed periodically, according to a predetermined schedule, and/or in batches of retrospective processes.</p>
<p id="p-0115" num="0117">It will also be appreciated by those of skill in the art that the instructions can be stored in non-transitory memory on a single device (e.g., a sensor control device or a reader device) or, in the alternative, can be distributed across multiple discrete devices, which can be located in geographically dispersed locations (e.g., the cloud). For example, in some embodiments, the collection of data indicative of an analyte level (e.g., glucose, lactate), determination of suspected false glucose conditions and correlative physiological conditions, application of lag corrections and/or data smoothing, and the termination of the glucose sensor can all be performed solely on the sensor control device. In some embodiments, the determination of suspected false glucose conditions and correlative physiological conditions, application of lag corrections and/or data smoothing can be performed on a reader device, or by a trusted computer system. Likewise, those of skill in the art will recognize that the representations of computing devices in the embodiments disclosed herein, such as those shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>, are intended to cover both physical devices and virtual devices (or &#x201c;virtual machines&#x201d;).</p>
<p id="p-0116" num="0118">Generally, with a fixed extent of lag correction, such as assuming a fixed lag time constant in implementing a first order differential equation model of blood glucose to interstitial glucose lag, the extent of lag correction is a tradeoff between the positive effect of lag correction on the aggregate performance and the negative effect of too much lag correction in uncertain areas, such as with suspected false low glucose condition. According to one aspect of the embodiments, by using secondary physiological measurements, the certainty of specific glucose conditions, such as low glucose concentration, can be distinguished from falsely low glucose condition; and, the full extent of the glucose sensor fluctuation can be assumed to be physiological. As a result, it is possible and, consequently, more advantageous to exercise a more aggressive lag correction with the use of secondary physiological measurements than the extent determined solely by a tradeoff consideration.</p>
<p id="p-0117" num="0119">By way of a non-limiting example, a tradeoff analysis may have concluded that a lag correction equivalent to compensating nine (9) minutes of lag is an optimal approach according to the aforementioned tradeoff. However, as the certainty of specific glucose conditions can be improved, a more aggressive lag correction equivalent to compensating twenty (20) minutes of lag may result in improved performance without increasing instances of false lag correction. For those of skill in the art, the determination of a more aggressive lag correction may involve a more complex model than the first order differential equation with more than one parameter, and do not necessarily imply increasing the values of all of the parameters in a lag correction model used.</p>
<p id="p-0118" num="0120"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>10</b></figref> is a flow diagram depicting an example embodiment of a method <b>1000</b> for improving the accuracy of glucose sensor data by using secondary physiological measurements. At Step <b>1002</b>, a sensor control device including an analyte sensor, processing circuitry, and memory, collects a first data indicative of a glucose level. At Step <b>1004</b>, a secondary sensing element collects a second data indicative of a secondary physiological measurement. As previously described with respect to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>9</b>A-E</figref>, according to one aspect of the embodiments, the secondary sensing element can comprise one or more of a heart rate monitor, an insertable cardiac monitor, an implantable ECG device, or an implantable EEG device, and the second physiological measurement can be one or more of a heart rate, a QT interval, an ECG, or an EEG. According to some embodiments, the secondary sensing element can comprise one or more of a ketone sensor, a continuous ketone monitor, or a ketone strip sensor (e.g., as part of a reader device), and the second physiological measurement can be a ketone level.</p>
<p id="p-0119" num="0121">At Step <b>1006</b>, based on the first data, a determination is made as to whether a suspected false glucose condition is absent.</p>
<p id="p-0120" num="0122">According to one aspect of the embodiments, a suspected false glucose condition can be a suspected false low glucose condition, such as a suspected false hypoglycemic condition. In some embodiments, the absence or presence of a suspected false low glucose condition can be ascertained by one or more tests using the first data, including but not limited to, determining if:</p>
<p id="p-0121" num="0123">i) one or more glucose sensor data quality checks suggests a suspected false low glucose condition;</p>
<p id="p-0122" num="0124">ii) a glucose level is below a first predetermined low glucose threshold;</p>
<p id="p-0123" num="0125">iii) an area under the curve (&#x201c;AUC&#x201d;) calculation (which can be based on a first recent predetermined time window with values below a second predetermined low glucose threshold) exceeds a predetermined low glucose AUC threshold;</p>
<p id="p-0124" num="0126">iv) a glucose percentile metric (e.g., from a second recent predetermined time window with values below a third predetermined low glucose threshold) exceeds a predetermined low glucose percentile threshold; or</p>
<p id="p-0125" num="0127">v) an average glucose level in a predetermined recent time window (e.g., a third recent predetermined time window) exceeds a third predetermined low glucose threshold.</p>
<p id="p-0126" num="0128">According to another aspect of the embodiments, the suspected false glucose condition can be a suspected false high glucose condition, such as a suspected false hyperglycemic condition. In some embodiments, the absence or presence of a suspected false high glucose condition can be ascertained by one or more tests using the first data, including but not limited to, determining if:</p>
<p id="p-0127" num="0129">i) one or more glucose sensor data quality checks suggests a suspected false high glucose condition;</p>
<p id="p-0128" num="0130">ii) a glucose level is above a first predetermined high glucose threshold;</p>
<p id="p-0129" num="0131">iii) an AUC calculation (which can be based on a fourth recent predetermined time window with values above a second predetermined high glucose threshold) exceeds a predetermined high glucose AUC threshold;</p>
<p id="p-0130" num="0132">iv) a glucose percentile metric (e.g., from a fifth recent predetermined time window with values above a third predetermined high glucose threshold) exceeds a predetermined high glucose percentile threshold; or</p>
<p id="p-0131" num="0133">v) an average glucose in a predetermined recent time window (e.g., a sixth recent predetermined time window) exceeds a third predetermined high glucose threshold.</p>
<p id="p-0132" num="0134">Referring back to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>10</b></figref>, at Step <b>1008</b>, the second data (e.g., the secondary physiological measurement) is analyzed to determine if a correlative physiological condition is present. According to one aspect of the embodiments, the correlative physiological condition can be one of: an inferred absence of high glucose, an inferred presence of high glucose, an inferred absence of low glucose, or an inferred presence of low glucose. According to some embodiments, for example, the presence of a correlative physiological condition can be ascertained by comparing a sensed ketone level (e.g., using a continuous ketone monitor or a ketone strip reader) to a predetermined ketone threshold. A high ketone level that exceeds the predetermined ketone threshold can indicate an inferred absence of low glucose (or, conversely, the inferred presence of high glucose). Similarly, according to some embodiments, the presence of a correlative physiological condition can be ascertained by comparing a heart rate measurement (e.g., using a heart rate monitor) to a predetermined heart rate threshold. A high or increased heart rate that exceeds the predetermined heart rate threshold can indicate an inferred absence of high glucose (or, conversely, the inferred presence of low glucose).</p>
<p id="p-0133" num="0135">According to one aspect of the embodiments, if it has been determined (from Step <b>1006</b>) that a suspected false glucose condition (e.g., a suspected false low glucose condition, such as a suspected false hypoglycemia) is absent, and if it has been determined (from Step <b>1008</b>) that a correlative physiological condition is present (e.g., a ketone level above a predetermined ketone threshold indicating an inferred absence of low glucose), then a first corrective action can be performed at Step <b>1010</b>. In some embodiments, the first corrective action can comprise an aggressive lag correction. For example, according to some embodiments, a more aggressive lag correction can be applied when a seventh recent predetermined time window presents no conflicting information&#x2014;for example, where: (1) an absence of a suspected low glucose condition is determined, and (2) the presence of a correlative physiological measurement is determined, wherein the correlative physiological measurement can be a ketone level above a predetermined ketone threshold indicating an inferred absence of low glucose.</p>
<p id="p-0134" num="0136">It will be further understood by those of skill in the art that a suspected false glucose condition can be a suspected false high glucose condition (such as, e.g., suspected false hyperglycemia), and that the correlative physiological condition can be an inferred absence of high glucose (such as, e.g., a heart rate above a predetermined heart rate threshold).</p>
<p id="p-0135" num="0137">Those of skill in the art will also understand that the step of determining the absence of a suspected false glucose condition (Step <b>1006</b>) can include determining the absence of both a suspected false low glucose condition and a suspected false high glucose condition, and, furthermore, determining, based on the second data, if a correlative physiological condition is present for both absent suspected false glucose conditions (Step <b>1008</b>).</p>
<p id="p-0136" num="0138">According to another aspect of some embodiments, if it has been determined (from Step <b>1006</b>) that a suspected false glucose condition is absent, but a correlative physiological condition is also absent, then a second corrective action (not shown) can be performed, wherein the second corrective action comprises one or more of a moderate lag correction or an increased glucose sensor signal smoothing.</p>
<p id="p-0137" num="0139">In some embodiments, the step of determining if a correlative physiological condition is present (Step <b>1008</b>) can also include determining a degree of correlation between the correlative physiological condition and the suspected false glucose condition. According to these embodiments, if the suspected false glucose condition is absent, but a correlative physiological condition is also absent, then a second corrective action (not shown) can be performed, wherein the second corrective action comprises one or both of a variable lag correction or a variable glucose sensor signal smoothing. According to another aspect of these embodiments, the variable lag correction can be a function of the degree of correlation between the correlative physiological condition and the suspected false glucose condition. Conversely, the variable glucose sensor signal smoothing can be an inverse function of the degree of correlation between the correlative physiological condition and the suspected false glucose condition. Those of skill in the art will also appreciate that other types of variable corrective actions (e.g., filtering, masking, etc.) can be performed, wherein the magnitude of the corrective action can be either a function or inverse function of the degree of correlation between the correlative physiological condition and the suspected false glucose condition.</p>
<p id="p-0138" num="0140">In addition, according to some embodiments, a third corrective action comprising an early termination of the glucose sensor can be taken if it has been determined that there is an absence of a suspected false glucose condition (e.g., an absence of suspected false hypoglycemia), and a correlative physiological condition is present that suggests an inferred absence of low glucose (e.g., a high ketone level above a predetermined ketone level threshold).</p>
<p id="p-0139" num="0141">According to another aspect of some embodiments, the determination of a conflict between the first data indicative of the glucose level and the second data indicative of a secondary physiological measurement can be basis to take one or more corrective actions. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>11</b></figref> is a flow diagram depicting an example embodiment of a method <b>1100</b> for terminating a sensor or masking sensor data from a glucose sensor based on a detected conflict between glucose data and secondary physiological measurements. At Step <b>1102</b>, a sensor control device including an analyte sensor, processing circuitry, and memory, collects a first data indicative of a glucose level. At Step <b>1104</b>, a secondary sensing element collects a second data indicative of a secondary physiological measurement. As previously described, the secondary sensing element can comprise one or more of a heart rate monitor, an insertable cardiac monitor, an implantable ECG device, or an implantable EEG device, and the second physiological measurement can be one or more of a heart rate, a QT interval, an ECG, or an EEG. According to some embodiments, the secondary sensing element can comprise one or more of a ketone sensor, a continuous ketone monitor, or a ketone strip sensor (e.g., as part of a reader device), and the second physiological measurement can be a ketone level.</p>
<p id="p-0140" num="0142">At Step <b>1106</b>, a determination is made as to whether there is a conflict or disagreement between the first data and the second data. According to many of the embodiments, a conflict can be defined as a disagreement between, on the one hand, a glucose measurement that is suggestive of a high glucose condition, a low glucose condition, a suspected false high glucose condition, or a suspected false low glucose condition, and, on the other hand, a correlative physiological condition, such as an inferred high glucose condition (e.g., high ketone level) or an inferred low glucose condition (e.g, increased or high heart rate).</p>
<p id="p-0141" num="0143">At Step <b>1108</b>, if such a conflict has been detected, the glucose sensor can be terminated or, in the alternative, the sensor data can be discarded and/or temporarily masked.
