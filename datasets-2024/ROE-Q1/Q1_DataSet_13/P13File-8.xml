<?summary-of-invention description="Summary of Invention" end="lead"?>
<p id="p-0002" num="0001">The invention relates to an aerosol generating article for providing an electrical stimulation to a user, a holding device for such aerosol generating article, and a holder including such aerosol generating article.</p>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">An aerosol generating article can here be understood as a discardable, single use consumable to be used with an electrically heated smoking system that generates aerosol from the aerosol generating article.</p>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">Aerosol generating articles of the prior art have a number of advantages over conventional cigarettes and cigars, but there is still room for improvement, in particular, providing aromatic notes and flavoring aspects when compared with a standard performance of conventional smoking articles, including conventional cigarettes and cigars.</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">It is therefore an object of the invention to provide an improved aerosol generating article that provides aromatic notes and flavoring aspects.</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">The object of the present disclosure is solved by the subject-matter of the independent claims, wherein further embodiments are incorporated in the dependent claims. It should be noted that the aspects of the disclosure described in the following apply to the aerosol generating article for providing an electrical stimulation to a user, the holding device for an aerosol generating article, and the holder including such aerosol generating article.</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">According to an aspect of the present disclosure, there is provided an aerosol generating article for providing an electrical stimulation to a user. The aerosol generating article comprises an aerosol forming substrate, a first electrode, and a second electrode.</p>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">The first electrode is at a first position of the aerosol forming substrate to provide a first electrical contact to the user.</p>
<p id="p-0009" num="0008">The second electrode is at a second position at a front face of the aerosol forming substrate to provide a second electrical contact to the user, wherein the second position is different from the first position to enable a provision of an electrical potential between the first electrode and the second electrode to provide an electrical stimulation to the user.</p>
<p id="p-0010" num="0009">The present aerosol generating article may provide aromatic notes and flavoring aspects by providing electrical stimulation to a user's taste buds during consumption. For example, the aerosol generating article can stimulate the taste buds of the tongue of the user via electrical signals.</p>
<p id="p-0011" num="0010">In other words, electrical impulses may be used to provide electrical taste stimulation on the tongue. The stimulation via the electric potential may cause the user to experience a taste of saltiness, bitterness, sour, sweet and/or umami. These stimulations may enhance the user's experience of aromatic notes and flavoring aspects. These electrically generated aromatic notes and flavoring aspects may improve or alter the user's perception of flavor. The electrically induced perception of flavor may resemble the flavor of conventional cigarettes and cigars. Alternatively, the electrically induced perception of flavor may enhance the user's experience by providing a perception of saltiness, bitterness, sour, sweet and/or umami. This enhanced flavor experience may ease the user's transition from conventional cigarettes and cigars to aerosol generating articles.</p>
<p id="p-0012" num="0011">The simulated taste sensation generated by an electrical stimulation of the taste buds of the tongue of the user can improve the flavor sensed by the user without adding compounds to aerosol generating article. As a result, a required number of ingredients in the aerosol generating article and the costs of the aerosol generating article is not increased. The present aerosol generating article may further allow a specific position of the electrodes to ensure an adequate and ergonomic function.</p>
<p id="p-0013" num="0012">The aerosol generating article can be understood as a discardable, single use consumable to be used with an electrically heated smoking system that generates aerosol from the aerosol generating article. The aerosol generating article may comprise a mouth end configured to be inserted into a user's mouth. An opposite end of the aerosol generating article may be configured to be inserted into a heated smoking system that generates aerosol from the aerosol generating article. The aerosol generating article may comprise a mouthpiece and an aerosol forming substrate wrapped in at least a tipping paper.</p>
<p id="p-0014" num="0013">The aerosol forming substrate can be understood as a rod-shaped article, which generates aerosol when being heated. The aerosol forming substrate may be tobacco. The tobacco may be shredded, granular, formed, rolled, corrugated or otherwise processed. The aerosol forming substrate may be herbal or plant material other than tobacco, which may be similarly processed. The aerosol forming substrate may be flavorings such as menthol or eucalyptus, and may be in liquid form or mixed with tobacco or other plant material. During consumption, the aerosol forming substrate is heated, and air flows past or through the aerosol forming substrate, delivering aerosol formed from the heated substrate to the user's mouth and lungs. This aerosol has flavor derived from the aerosol forming substrate. The aromatic notes and flavoring aspects of the aerosol derived from the aerosol forming substrate may be enhanced by electrical stimulation of taste buds in the tongue of a user.</p>
<p id="p-0015" num="0014">The first electrode and the second electrode are different electrodes. They are positioned at different locations to provide different contact areas for the user. For example, a user may contact the first electrical contact with their tongue. For example, a user may contact the second electrode with another part of their tongue or their lip. The electrodes may be made of an electric conductive material, preferably metal, and more preferably a silver compound.</p>
<p id="p-0016" num="0015">The front face of the aerosol generating article can be understood as an end surface of the aerosol generating article. The front face may be at the mouth end of the aerosol generating article. The front face may extend essentially perpendicular or angular to a longitudinal direction and/or a lateral surface of the aerosol generating article. The front face may be accessible to a tongue of a user and in particular to a tip of the tongue. This means the electrode at the front face may be at a location where it is touched by the tongue and the taste buds located there, when in use. The electrode may provide an electric potential to the tip of the tongue, which is particularly sensitive for taste sensations (for example, salty tastes).</p>
<p id="p-0017" num="0016">The lateral surface of the aerosol generating article can be understood as different from the front face of the aerosol generating article. It can be an outer surface of the aerosol generating article extending along the longitudinal direction of the aerosol generating article. The lateral surface can be a circumferential or peripheral surface of the aerosol generating article.</p>
<p id="p-0018" num="0017">The electrical potential between the first electrode and the second electrode may cause a difference in electric potential between a part of the tongue and another part of the mouth. The difference in electric potential may stimulate the taste buds of the tongue to bring an artificial taste to the tongue to improve the flavor sensation of the user.</p>
<p id="p-0019" num="0018">In an embodiment, the first electrode is also at the front face of the aerosol forming substrate. Then, both electrodes are at the front face of the aerosol forming substrate. They share the front face. They can be only at the surface of the front face or at least one of the electrodes can further extend around a portion of the lateral surface of the aerosol forming substrate. In the first case, the electrodes together form a disc at the front face. In the second case, the electrodes together form a cap around the front face and a portion of the lateral surface of the aerosol forming substrate. The front face may be accessible to a tongue of a user and in particular to a tip of the tongue. This means both electrodes at the front face may be at a location where they are touched by the tongue and its taste buds, when in use. Both electrodes may provide an electric potential to different spots on the tip of the tongue, which is particularly sensitive for taste sensations (for example, salty tastes).</p>
<p id="p-0020" num="0019">In another embodiment, the first electrode is on a lateral surface of the aerosol forming substrate. The first electrode may surround at least partially or completely a portion of the lateral surface of the aerosol generating article. The first electrode may be in form of a full or interrupted band or ring around the aerosol forming substrate.</p>
<p id="p-0021" num="0020">When the first electrode is on the lateral surface of the aerosol forming substrate, it may be accessible to the tongue of the user and in particular to a central area on the tongue. This means the first electrode may be at a location where it is touched by a central part of the tongue, which is different to and &#x201c;behind&#x201d; the tip of the tongue, when in use. It may provide electrical stimulation the central part of the tongue and taste buds located there. The first electrode may provide an electric potential to the central area on the tongue to provide a difference in potential between the first electrode at the central area on the tongue and the second electrode at the tip of the tongue. The difference in electrical potential may stimulate the taste buds of the tongue to bring an artificial taste to the tongue. The electrodes may provide an electric potential to different parts of the tongue, which may be sensitive for different taste sensations compared to the tip of the tongue.</p>
<p id="p-0022" num="0021">When the first electrode is on the lateral surface of the aerosol forming substrate, it may be accessible to a lip of the user. The first electrode may be accessible to a lower lip, an upper lip or both lips of the user. This means the first electrode may be at a location where it is touched by at least a lip of the user, when in use. The first electrode may provide an electric potential to the lip to provide a difference in potential between the first electrode at the lip and the second electrode at the tongue. Only one electrode may provide the electric potential to the taste buds of the tongue, while the other electrode contacts the lip, which might be more sensitive for other sensations, as for example temperature.</p>
<p id="p-0023" num="0022">Of course, the first electrode can be arranged at the front face and at the lateral surface of the aerosol forming substrate to be accessible to the tongue and to the lip of the user. In all cases, the first and second electrodes may provide a difference in electric potential to different parts of the mouth. A difference in potential between the first electrode and the second electrode may stimulate the taste buds of the tongue to bring an artificial taste to the tongue.</p>
<p id="p-0024" num="0023">The aerosol forming substrate may further comprise a third electrode accessible for a third region of the mouth, different from the first electrode and the second electrode. As a result, three different body parts of the user may be used for the taste stimulation, as for example the tongue, the upper and the lower lip or a first part of the tongue, a second, different part of the tongue and the lip. This might also intensify the user experience. Of course, the aerosol forming substrate may also comprise even more than three electrodes.</p>
<p id="p-0025" num="0024">In an embodiment, the first electrode and the second electrode are electrically connectable to an electric power source to provide the electrical potential between the first electrode and the second electrode. In particular, they may be reversibly connectable or connected to an electric power source. The power source may be configured to provide the electrical potential between the first electrode and the second electrode to stimulate the taste buds. The power source may be a battery or a battery pack. It may be rechargeable.</p>
<p id="p-0026" num="0025">In an embodiment, the electrical potential may be an alternating electrical potential. It may have a frequency in a range of 50 Hz to 1200 Hz, preferably 500 Hz to 700 Hz. Such frequencies may have an apparent effect on human tissues without causing vibrations of the electrode.</p>
<p id="p-0027" num="0026">In an embodiment, the power source may be configured to provide the electrical potential with a current in a range of 20 &#x3bc;A to 300 &#x3bc;A, preferably 20 &#x3bc;A to 200 &#x3bc;A, more preferably 40 &#x3bc;A to 180 &#x3bc;A, and even more preferably 100 &#x3bc;A to 130 &#x3bc;A. The electrical current may be an alternating electrical current, preferably with steps of 20 &#x3bc;A to provide a distinguishable intensity of the stimulation.</p>
<p id="p-0028" num="0027">In an embodiment, the first electrode may be electrically connected to a first electrically conductive element extending at least partially along the aerosol forming substrate. The first electrically conductive element may be electrically connected to a first electric terminal arranged at the aerosol forming substrate. The first electric terminal may be electrically connectable to the electric power source. The position of the electric terminal can be at a center of the aerosol generating article to keep the electric terminal with a safety distance to the heating for the aerosol generating article.</p>
<p id="p-0029" num="0028">In an embodiment, the second electrode may be electrically connected to a second electrically conductive element extending at least partially along the aerosol forming substrate. The second electrically conductive element may be electrically connected to a second electric terminal arranged at the aerosol forming substrate. The second electric terminal may be electrically connectable to the electric power source. Again, the position of the electric terminal can be at a center of the aerosol generating article to keep the electric terminal with a safety distance to the heating for the aerosol generating article.</p>
<p id="p-0030" num="0029">An electrode may extend substantially perpendicular to a longitudinal extension of the corresponding electrically conductive element. &#x201c;Substantially&#x201d; in this context is intended to indicate to those of ordinary skill in the art that the term &#x201c;perpendicular&#x201d; is not intended to mean only perfectly perpendicular, but can incorporate ordinary deviations from perfectly perpendicular. Therefore, &#x201c;substantially perpendicular&#x201d; in this instance means that the electrode may deviate from ninety degrees from the longitudinal extension of the electrically conductive element by one degree, two degrees, three degrees, four degrees, five degrees, five to ten degrees and up to twenty-five degrees. The term &#x201c;substantially&#x201d; is used accordingly throughout this specification. The longitudinal extension of the electrically conductive element may extend substantially perpendicular to a longitudinal extension of the corresponding electric terminal.</p>
<p id="p-0031" num="0030">The electrodes, electrically conductive elements and/or the electric terminals can be at least partially be made of electrically conductive materials such as conductive polymers, conductive composites, metallic materials and/or the like.</p>

<p id="p-0104" num="0114"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>5</b><i>a </i>and <b>5</b><i>b </i></figref>show two different embodiments of an aerosol generating article <b>400</b> according to the present disclosure. In both cases, the aerosol generating article <b>400</b> comprises an aerosol forming substrate <b>470</b>, a first electrode <b>450</b>, and a second electrode <b>460</b>. The first electrode <b>450</b> is at a first position of the aerosol forming substrate <b>470</b> to provide a first electrical contact to the user. The second electrode <b>460</b> is at a second position at a front face FF of the aerosol forming substrate <b>470</b> to provide a second electrical contact to the user. The front face FF of the aerosol generating article <b>400</b> can be understood as an end surface at a mouth end of the aerosol generating article <b>400</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0105" num="0115">The second position is different from the first position. The aerosol generating article <b>400</b> enables a provision of an electrical potential between the first electrode <b>450</b> and the second electrode <b>460</b> to cause a difference in electric potential between a part of the tongue and another part of the mouth. The difference in electric potential may stimulate the taste buds of the tongue to bring an artificial taste to the tongue to improve the flavor sensation of the user.</p>
<p id="p-0106" num="0116">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b><i>a</i></figref>, the first electrode <b>450</b> and the second electrode <b>460</b> are at a front face FF of the aerosol generating article <b>400</b>.

The lateral surface LF of the aerosol generating article <b>400</b> can be understood as an outer, circumferential or peripheral surface of the aerosol generating article <b>400</b> extending along a longitudinal direction of the aerosol generating article <b>400</b>. The first electrode <b>450</b> surrounds a portion of the lateral surface of the aerosol generating article <b>400</b> like a ring. When the first electrode <b>450</b> is on the lateral surface LF of the aerosol generating article <b>400</b>, it is accessible to the tongue of the user and in particular to a central area on the tongue. This means the first electrode <b>450</b> may be touched by a central part of the tongue, which is different to and &#x201c;behind&#x201d; the tip of the tongue, when in use. When the first electrode <b>450</b> is on the lateral surface LF of the aerosol generating article <b>400</b>, it is also accessible to a lip and in particular to a lower lip, an upper lip or both lips of the user.
