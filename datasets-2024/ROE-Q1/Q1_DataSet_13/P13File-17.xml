<heading id="h-0002" level="1">FIELD</heading>
<p id="p-0003" num="0012">This disclosure relates generally to surface cleaning apparatus such as hand vacuum cleaners, upright vacuum cleaners, stick vacuum cleaners or canister vacuum cleaners, and, in particular, portable surface cleaning apparatus, such as hand vacuum cleaners.</p>
<heading id="h-0003" level="1">INTRODUCTION</heading>
<p id="p-0004" num="0013">The following is not an admission that anything discussed below is part of the prior art or part of the common general knowledge of a person skilled in the art.</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0014">Various types of surface cleaning apparatus are known, including upright surface cleaning apparatus, canister surface cleaning apparatus, stick surface cleaning apparatus, central vacuum systems, and hand carriable surface cleaning apparatus such as hand vacuum cleaners. Further, various designs for cyclonic surface cleaning apparatus, including battery operated cyclonic hand vacuum cleaners are known in the art.</p>
<heading id="h-0004" level="1">SUMMARY</heading>
<p id="p-0006" num="0015">The following introduction is provided to introduce the reader to the more detailed discussion to follow. The introduction is not intended to limit or define any claimed or as yet unclaimed invention. One or more inventions may reside in any combination or sub-combination of the elements or process steps disclosed in any part of this document including its claims and figures.</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0016">In accordance with an aspect of this disclosure, which may be used alone or in combination with any one or more other aspects, a surface cleaning apparatus includes an air treatment assembly. A rib extends into a chamber of the assembly from a wall of the chamber, which may be a cyclone. The rib interrupts air flow, which may be cyclonic air flow, and encourages dirt accumulation adjacent the rib. The rib may be at one of the ends of the chamber, and optionally at an end at which an air outlet of the chamber is located. The rib may extend inwardly into the air treatment chamber from the air treatment chamber end wall (e.g., the outlet end wall). The rib may extend radially into the air treatment chamber from an air treatment chamber sidewall (e.g., radially inwardly) and/or axially from the air treatment chamber end wall. The air treatment chamber air outlet may comprise an air permeable portion through which the air flow path extends. The outlet may also include an air impermeable portion. The air permeable portion may be a porous portion comprising a porous material that extends inwardly from the air impermeable portion. The rib may extend co-extensively (i.e., with respect to a cyclone axis) along at least a portion of the cyclone chamber in which the impermeable portion of the outlet is provided.</p>
<p id="p-0008" num="0017">In accordance with another aspect of this disclosure, which may be used alone or in combination with any one or more other aspects, the air treatment inlet conduit extends into the air treatment chamber from an upstream opening to a downstream opening. The downstream opening may be a tangential opening into the chamber when the chamber is a cyclone chamber. The inlet may include an air permeable section (e.g., covered by porous material such as a mesh) that is discrete from the downstream opening of the inlet conduit. The bulk of air is directed through the downstream opening, which may be referred to as the primary opening. A lesser volume of air is allowed to pass through the air permeable section from the air treatment inlet conduit into the air treatment chamber. The downstream opening and the air permeable section provide alternate air exits which concurrently permit air flow therethrough. The air permeable section forms a secondary pathway between the air treatment inlet conduit and the air treatment chamber. This secondary pathway results in a reduction of the power required for the motor to produce a given air flow rate.</p>
<p id="p-0009" num="0018">In accordance with another aspect of this disclosure, which may be used alone or in combination with any one or more other aspects, the axial length of the downstream opening of the inlet conduit is variable. The axial length of the downstream opening may be varied to change the separation characteristics of the surface cleaning apparatus, such as to change backpressure or to change the ratio between an effective air inlet axial length and the chamber axial length. The ratio between the effective air inlet axial length and the chamber axial length affects the number of turns that air passing through the cyclone chamber is subject to, and so affects the efficiency of the surface cleaning apparatus. The axial length may be changed manually by a user or automatically, e.g., in response to, e.g., detecting that finer particles are being collected or that particles are making past the air treatment assembly of the surface cleaning apparatus.</p>
<p id="p-0010" num="0019">In accordance with another aspect of this disclosure, which may be used alone or in combination with any one or more other aspects, the air treatment inlet is selectively closeable by a closure member. When the closure member is in the open position, during operation of the surface cleaning apparatus, air flows through the air treatment inlet to the air treatment chamber. When the closure member is in the closed position, air flow through the air treatment inlet is inhibited. The closure member may be curved along at least one dimension with respect to a coordinate system defined by the apparatus longitudinal axis, the apparatus vertical axis, and the apparatus tangential axis. The closure member may therefore be referred to as a curved member. Optionally, the closure member is curved with respect only to a single dimension, as exemplified. In other words, the closure member may be arcuate in shape. The closure member may pivot about a closure axis of rotation between an open position and a closed position.</p>
<p id="p-0011" num="0020">In accordance with another aspect of this disclosure, which may be used alone or in combination with any one or more other aspects, the closure member moves axially with respect to the air treatment member longitudinal axis and/or the inlet conduit axis. The closure member may be an end wall of the air treatment inlet. The inlet end wall may extend transverse to the flow direction. The inlet end wall may include a generally planar inlet end wall upstream face, which may extend generally perpendicular to the flow direction. Alternatively, the closure member may close a tangential inlet to the air treatment chamber. The closure member may be received against a sidewall of the air treatment inlet and translate axially to close the tangential inlet.</p>
<p id="p-0012" num="0021">In accordance with another aspect of this disclosure, which may be used alone or in combination with any one or more other aspects, the air treatment assembly has an assembly free volume that includes the chamber free volume within the chamber and an inlet free volume within the air treatment inlet. The chamber free volume is an open space within the air treatment chamber outside the air treatment inlet and the air treatment outlet. The inlet free volume is an open space within the air treatment inlet that would be included in the air flow path if the closure member was not included in the surface cleaning apparatus. The closure member in the open position may be at least partially removed from the assembly free volume. The closure member in the open position may be fully removed from the assembly free volume. This aspect reduces the extent to which the closure member inhibits air flow when in the open position and/or reduces turbulence caused by a significant discontinuity in the transverse cross sectional area of the air treatment inlet at a downstream edge of the closure member when the closure member is in the open position. The closure member is moveable between the open and closed positions, and, when in the open position, may be at least partially received in a closure recess or partially moved into or through a closure passage. The recess may have a mouth or port through which it is open to the assembly free volume, and the closure member may close the port when the closure member is in the open position.</p>
<p id="p-0013" num="0022">In accordance with another aspect of this disclosure, which may be used alone or in combination with any one or more other aspects, the surface cleaning apparatus includes a driving member drivingly connected to the closure member. The closure member may move in a first direction from the open position to the closed position. The closure member may move in a second direction from the closed position to the open position. The driving member may be operable to move the closure member in at least one of the first and second directions. The driving member may be any suitable driving member. The driving member may include a closure member actuator, such as an electromechanical actuator. The driving member may include a manually moveable member. The driving member may include a suction-powered piston. The driving member may include an external conduit (e.g., a removable wand) removably insertable into the surface cleaning apparatus.</p>
<p id="p-0014" num="0023">In accordance with another aspect of this disclosure, which may be used alone or in combination with any one or more other aspects, at least a portion of a first end of the chamber is moveable between a closed operating position and an open position. The chamber first end may include the evacuation opening, and the evacuation opening may be closed when the moveable portion of the chamber first end is in the closed operating position and open when the moveable portion of the chamber first end is in the open position. The moveable portion may be rotationally moveable, translationally moveable, or inflatable and deflatable. A docking station may be operable to move the moveable portion of the chamber first end between the closed operating position and the open position.</p>
<p id="p-0015" num="0024">In accordance with another aspect of this disclosure, which may be used alone or in combination with any one or more other aspects, at least a portion of an end of the air treatment chamber is translatable generally parallel to the chamber longitudinal axis. The axially moveable end portion is moveable between a first position and a second position that is axially spaced from the first position. The second position may be forward of the first position. The axially moveable end portion may act as a plunger, e.g., to move debris through the chamber.</p>
<p id="p-0016" num="0025">In accordance with another aspect of this disclosure, which may be used alone or in combination with any one or more other aspects, opening at least a portion of the chamber first end moves at least a portion of the chamber second end. The at least a portion of the chamber second end that moves in response to opening the at least a portion of the chamber first end may be joined thereto by a linking member. The at least a portion of the chamber second end that moves in response to opening the at least a portion of the chamber first end may be an axially moveable second end portion. The at least a portion of the chamber first end may be an axially moveable first end portion.</p>
<p id="p-0017" num="0026">In accordance with another aspect of this disclosure, which may be used alone or in combination with any one or more other aspects, a fluid driven moveable member of the surface cleaning apparatus is moveable via fluid pressure through the surface cleaning apparatus, and is moveable via the fluid pressure between a first position and a second position. It will be appreciated that the fluid pressure may be air pressure (i.e., suction) generated by an air moving member of the surface cleaning apparatus or docking station. The fluid driven moveable member may be received in the apparatus air flow path and/or the evacuation air flow path. The fluid driven moveable member may include or consist of the chamber first end or a moveable portion thereof. The fluid driven moveable member may include or consist of the chamber second end or a moveable portion thereof.</p>
<p id="p-0018" num="0027">In accordance with another aspect of this disclosure, which may be used alone or in combination with any one or more other aspects, a user interface is provided at an upper end of a pistol grip handle. This location provides the user interface at a convenient location for a user of the interface.</p>
<p id="p-0019" num="0028">In accordance with another aspect of this disclosure, which may be used alone or in combination with any one or more other aspects, the user interface overlies the main body housing. The main body housing may contain the suction motor. The user interface may overly the suction motor housing. The user interface may be separated such that the user interface is not attached to the suction motor housing. The user interface may be spaced from the main body housing, and may be spaced from the main body housing by a separation air gap.</p>
<p id="p-0020" num="0029">In accordance with another aspect of this disclosure, which may be used alone or in combination with any one or more other aspects, the surface cleaning apparatus includes an annular portion. The user interface may be provided on the annular portion. The user interface may be secured to the annular portion. Optionally, the annular portion is part of the apparatus rear end. The user interface may be curved to follow an annular surface of the annular portion. The user interface may include an information display having a display surface that faces radially outward. The user interface may also, or alternatively, include an information display having a display surface that faces rearwardly.</p>
<p id="p-0021" num="0030">In accordance with another aspect of this disclosure, which may be used alone or in combination with any one or more other aspects, the surface cleaning apparatus includes a filter that is removeable from an installed position to a removed position outside the main body housing. The filter is moveable between the installed and removed positions along a removal path. The removal path may extend past the user interface between the installed position and the removed position. The removal path may extend through the user interface. The filter may be, e.g., the post-motor filter. The post-motor filter may remove rearwardly though an annular user interface body.</p>
<p id="p-0022" num="0031">In accordance with another aspect of this disclosure, which may be used alone or in combination with any one or more other aspects, a filter is removable radially outwardly with respect to the apparatus longitudinal axis. The filter may be removeable in a direction that is generally perpendicular to the apparatus longitudinal axis. The filter is removeable between an installed position and a removed position, and is removeable along a removal path. The removal path may be a radially extending path, as exemplified. The removal path may be a laterally extending path. The removal path may be generally horizontal when the apparatus upper end is above the apparatus lower end, and may be generally parallel to the apparatus transverse axis. The surface cleaning apparatus may include a plurality of radially removable filters.</p>
<p id="p-0023" num="0032">In accordance with another aspect of this disclosure, which may be used alone or in combination with any one or more other aspects, a filter is at least partially nested within the air treatment outlet. Nesting the filter may allow the surface cleaning apparatus to have a shorter axial length. The filter at least partially nested within the air treatment outlet may be the pre-motor filter.</p>
<p id="p-0024" num="0033">In accordance with another aspect of this disclosure, which may be used alone or in combination with any one or more other aspects, the surface cleaning apparatus includes an ultraviolet light source. The ultraviolet light source is operable to generate ultraviolet light. The ultraviolet light may be used to disinfect an interior or external surface of the surface cleaning apparatus (e.g., a handle external surface or an internal surface facing the air flow path). The ultraviolet light source may be arranged to direct the ultraviolet light into a light carrying structure (such as a light pipe). The apparatus may include at least one wall that is transparent to ultraviolet light.</p>
<p id="p-0025" num="0034">In accordance with another aspect of this disclosure, which may be used alone or in combination with any one or more other aspects, the surface cleaning apparatus may include a dirt scoop. The dirt scoop is moveable between an operational position and an evacuation position. In the operational position, the dirt scoop extends into the air treatment chamber. As it moves to the evacuation position, the dirt scoop sweeps through the chamber to dislodge debris.</p>
<p id="p-0026" num="0035">In accordance with another aspect of this disclosure, which may be used alone or in combination with any one or more other aspects, the surface cleaning apparatus may include a cyclone having a cyclone axis of rotation that intersects first and second axially opposed ends of the cyclone. The air outlet comprises a porous member that extends axially inwardly into the cyclone from the second end. The porous member has an axially inner end and an axially outer end located at the second end. The axial outer end is positioned at the cyclone sidewall.</p>
<p id="p-0027" num="0036">In accordance with another aspect of this disclosure, which may be used alone or in combination with any one or more other aspects, the surface cleaning apparatus may include a cyclone having a cyclone axis of rotation that intersects first and second axially opposed ends of the cyclone.

<heading id="h-0007" level="2">General Description of a Surface Cleaning Apparatus</heading>
<p id="p-0116" num="0125">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>1</b> and <b>2</b></figref>, an exemplary embodiment of a surface cleaning apparatus is shown generally as <b>100</b>. The surface cleaning apparatus is exemplified as a hand vacuum cleaner with an apparatus front end <b>102</b>, an apparatus rear end <b>104</b>, an apparatus upper end <b>106</b> and an apparatus lower end <b>108</b>. An apparatus longitudinal axis <b>110</b> extends between the apparatus front end <b>102</b> and the apparatus rear end <b>104</b>. An apparatus vertical axis <b>112</b> extends between the apparatus upper end <b>106</b> and apparatus lower end <b>108</b>. The apparatus vertical axis <b>112</b> is perpendicular to the apparatus longitudinal axis <b>110</b>. An apparatus transverse axis <b>114</b> is perpendicular to each of the apparatus vertical axis <b>112</b> and the apparatus longitudinal axis <b>110</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0117" num="0126">The surface cleaning apparatus <b>100</b> includes a main body <b>120</b>. The main body <b>120</b> includes a main body housing <b>122</b> and a handle <b>124</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0118" num="0127">As exemplified, the handle <b>124</b> may be a pistol grip handle with a hand grip portion <b>126</b> that extends generally vertically. The handle <b>124</b> has a longest dimension in the direction of a handle longitudinal axis <b>128</b>. As exemplified, the handle longitudinal axis <b>128</b> may be generally transverse to the apparatus longitudinal axis <b>110</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0119" num="0128">The handle <b>124</b> may be a pistol grip handle with a handle upper end <b>130</b> of the pistol grip handle mounted to a lower end of the surface cleaning apparatus <b>100</b>. The handle <b>124</b> may extend away from the main body housing <b>122</b>. The handle may be below the suction motor, the pre-motor filter, and/or the air treatment assembly. Arranging the handle below a heavy and/or bulky component of the surface cleaning apparatus <b>100</b> may result in a more desirable hand-feel of the surface cleaning apparatus <b>100</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0120" num="0129">The handle upper end <b>130</b> may be mounted to one or more of a suction motor housing, the pre-motor filter housing and the air treatment assembly. For example, the handle upper end <b>130</b> may be mounted to each of the air treatment assembly and the pre-motor filter housing. Alternately, the handle upper end <b>130</b> may be mounted to each of the pre-motor filter housing and the suction motor housing.</p>
<p id="p-0121" num="0130">It will be appreciated that the main body housing <b>122</b> and/or handle <b>124</b> may be in other configurations, shapes, and/or positions in other embodiments.</p>
<p id="p-0122" num="0131">The illustrated example surface cleaning apparatus is a hand vacuum cleaner, which may also be referred to as a &#x201c;handvac&#x201d; or &#x201c;hand-held vacuum cleaner&#x201d;. As used herein, a hand vacuum cleaner is a vacuum cleaner that can be operated to clean a surface generally one-handedly. That is, the entire weight of the vacuum may be held by the same one hand used to direct a dirty air inlet of the vacuum cleaner with respect to a surface to be cleaned. For example, the handle and a clean air inlet may be rigidly coupled to each other (directly or indirectly) so as to move as one while maintaining a constant orientation relative to each other. This is to be contrasted with canister and upright vacuum cleaners, whose weight is typically supported by a surface (e.g., a floor) during use.</p>
<p id="p-0123" num="0132">It will be appreciated that any one or more of the features of the surface cleaning apparatus <b>100</b> set out herein may alternately be used in any type of surface cleaning apparatus, such as an upright surface cleaning apparatus, a stick vac, a canister surface cleaning apparatus, an extractor or the like. It will also be appreciated that a surface cleaning apparatus may use any configuration of the operating components and the airflow paths exemplified herein.</p>
<p id="p-0124" num="0133">As exemplified in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>3</b> and <b>4</b></figref>, it will also be appreciated that the surface cleaning apparatus <b>100</b> may form a part of a larger surface cleaning apparatus <b>152</b> (e.g., a stick vacuum cleaner). As exemplified, the surface cleaning apparatus <b>100</b> may be mounted to an outlet end of an upright support member or rigid wand or external conduit <b>140</b> (e.g., a wand of a stick vacuum).</p>
<p id="p-0125" num="0134">The external conduit <b>140</b> may be a rigid conduit (e.g., formed of rigid plastic and/or metal). The external conduit <b>140</b> extends between an external conduit inlet end <b>142</b> and an external conduit outlet end <b>144</b>. The external conduit <b>140</b> includes an external conduit sidewall <b>146</b> extending between the external conduit inlet end <b>142</b> and the external conduit outlet end <b>144</b>. The external conduit <b>140</b> may be a linear rigid conduit extending linearly along an external conduit longitudinal axis <b>148</b> between the external conduit inlet end <b>142</b> and the external conduit outlet end <b>144</b>, the longitudinal axis extending along a longest dimension of the external conduit <b>140</b>. Alternatively, or additionally, the external conduit <b>140</b> may include a flexible portion and/or a non-linear portion. For example, the external conduit <b>140</b> may include a flexible hose portion and a rigid portion.</p>
<p id="p-0126" num="0135">Optionally, the external conduit <b>140</b> is mounted (e.g., rotationally such as pivotally mounted) at an upstream end <b>142</b> to a surface cleaning head <b>150</b>, whereby the surface cleaning apparatus forms a stick type surface cleaning apparatus <b>152</b>. It will be appreciated that the external conduit <b>140</b> may be provided without the surface cleaning head <b>150</b>. For example, the external conduit <b>140</b> may be removably receivable in the surface cleaning apparatus <b>100</b> whereby an effective nozzle of the surface cleaning apparatus <b>100</b> is extended to the upstream end <b>142</b>, thereby extending the reach of the hand vacuum cleaner for, e.g., above floor cleaning.</p>

<p id="p-0128" num="0137">In some embodiments, the surface cleaning apparatus <b>100</b> is operable in different modes, and may include a mode for use with the floor cleaning head <b>150</b> and a mode for use without the floor cleaning head. For example, when the surface cleaning apparatus <b>100</b> is mounted to the floor cleaning unit <b>154</b>, the surface cleaning apparatus <b>100</b> may be operable in a floor cleaner mode. When the surface cleaning apparatus <b>100</b> is removed from the floor cleaning unit <b>154</b>, the surface cleaning apparatus <b>100</b> may be operable in an above floor cleaning mode. The floor cleaning mode may provide a different (e.g., lesser) level of power to an air moving member of the hand vacuum unit than the above floor cleaning mode, resulting in, e.g., a different efficiency, run time, and/or physical configuration of the surface cleaning apparatus <b>100</b>, as discussed further elsewhere herein.</p>

The inlet conduit longitudinal axis <b>176</b> may be generally parallel to the apparatus longitudinal axis <b>110</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0134" num="0143">As exemplified, the inlet conduit <b>170</b> may form a nozzle <b>180</b> of the surface cleaning apparatus <b>100</b>. Alternatively, or additionally, the inlet conduit <b>170</b> may be connected or directly connected to an accessory, such as the external conduit <b>140</b> (e.g., a wand). The accessory may be any suitable accessory tool such as a rigid air flow conduit (e.g., an above floor cleaning wand), a crevice tool, a mini brush, and the like. The accessory may be coupled to the surface cleaning apparatus <b>100</b> such that the accessory is in air flow communication with the dirty air inlet (e.g., in air flow communication with the inlet conduit <b>170</b>).

<p id="p-0190" num="0199">In accordance with this aspect, as exemplified in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>11</b> to <b>13</b></figref>, the air treatment assembly <b>200</b> includes a rib <b>420</b> extending into a chamber of the assembly <b>200</b> from a wall of the chamber. The rib <b>420</b> interrupts air flow (cyclonic air flow if the chamber is a cyclone chamber) and encourages dirt accumulation adjacent the rib <b>420</b>. The rib <b>420</b> may be at one of the ends of the chamber, and optionally at an end at which an air outlet of the chamber is located. Accordingly, the rib may create an area at the air outlet end of the air treatment chamber which has diminished or minimal or no air circulation and, accordingly, dirt, e.g., finer dirt, may be accumulated therein.</p>
<p id="p-0191" num="0200">Optionally, as exemplified in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>13</b></figref>, the air treatment outlet <b>232</b> may comprise an outlet air permeable portion <b>422</b> and a downstream outlet air impermeable portion <b>424</b> through which the apparatus air flow path <b>160</b> extends. The outlet air permeable portion <b>422</b> may be an outlet porous portion comprising an outlet porous material <b>426</b>, e.g., a screen. The air treatment outlet <b>232</b> may include a central open region through which the air treatment longitudinal axis <b>218</b> extends, with a screen or other outlet porous material <b>426</b> through which the apparatus air flow path <b>160</b> passes.</p>
<p id="p-0192" num="0201">As exemplified, the outlet air impermeable portion <b>424</b> and the outlet porous portion <b>422</b> are parts of a vortex finder <b>238</b> of a cyclone. In such an embodiment, the air treatment outlet <b>232</b> includes the vortex finder <b>238</b>, and may consist of the vortex finder <b>238</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0193" num="0202">The outlet air impermeable portion <b>424</b> may be a conduit having an air impermeable sidewall extending between inlet and outlet ends, such as a linear cylindrical conduit as exemplified. The outlet porous portion <b>422</b> has an axially inward end <b>430</b> and an opposite axially outward end <b>432</b>. The axially outward end <b>432</b> is located at the inner end <b>434</b> of the outlet air impermeable portion <b>424</b>. The outlet air impermeable portion <b>424</b> extends between the inner end <b>434</b> and an outward end <b>436</b>. As exemplified, the outlet porous portion <b>422</b> may extend further inwardly into the air treatment chamber <b>210</b> from the inner end <b>434</b> of the outlet air impermeable portion <b>424</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0194" num="0203">As exemplified, the air impermeable portion <b>424</b> may include, or consist of, an annular portion of the vortex finder <b>238</b>. As exemplified, the air impermeable portion <b>424</b> may include an annular strip extending a predetermined axial length along the longitudinal axis <b>218</b>, and the strip may have a generally constant axial length around the circumference. For example, the axial length of the strip of the impermeable portion <b>242</b> may be between 1 mm and 10 mm, 2 mm and 8 mm, or about 5 mm. In some embodiments, the air impermeable portion may include a projecting portion <b>425</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>11</b></figref>) extending further axially than the remainder. The projecting portion may comprise ribs that assist in maintaining the shape of the screen during use.</p>
<p id="p-0195" num="0204">Referring again to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>11</b> to <b>13</b></figref>, the rib <b>420</b> may extend co-extensively (i.e., with respect to the cyclone axis <b>218</b>) along at least a portion of, and optionally all of, the air treatment chamber <b>210</b> in which the outlet air impermeable portion <b>424</b> of the air treatment outlet <b>232</b> is provided. The rib <b>420</b> and outlet air impermeable portion <b>424</b> may extend into the air treatment chamber <b>210</b> from a common wall. As exemplified, both the outlet air impermeable portion <b>424</b> and the rib <b>420</b> extend into the air treatment chamber <b>210</b> from the treatment chamber second end <b>216</b> (e.g., a rear end, and may extend from the treatment chamber second end wall <b>224</b>). The rib <b>420</b> and outlet air impermeable portion <b>424</b> together form a dead zone <b>440</b> between the rib and the air impermeable portion. As exemplified, the dead zone <b>440</b> is at the treatment chamber second end <b>216</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0196" num="0205">It will be appreciated that the rib <b>420</b> may extend further into the air treatment chamber <b>210</b> along the air treatment longitudinal axis <b>218</b> than the impermeable portion, or the impermeable portion may extend further into the air treatment chamber <b>210</b> along the air treatment longitudinal axis <b>218</b> than the rib, or the rib <b>420</b> and outlet air impermeable portion <b>424</b> may extend equally far into the air treatment chamber <b>210</b>. Optionally, the rib <b>420</b> extends into the air treatment chamber only coextensively with the outlet air impermeable portion <b>424</b>, and not with the outlet permeable portion <b>422</b>. In other words, the forward end of the rib is located at or rearward of the porous portion <b>422</b> and accordingly, the rib <b>420</b> may extend into the air treatment chamber <b>210</b> to a distance equal to or less than the outlet air impermeable portion <b>424</b>. Keeping the rib <b>420</b> from extending coextensively with the outlet air permeable portion <b>422</b> may reduce the obstruction of airflow into the permeable portion.</p>
<p id="p-0197" num="0206">The rib <b>420</b> may extend inwardly, e.g., axially inwardly, into the air treatment chamber <b>210</b> from an end wall <b>224</b> of the air treatment chamber. However, it will be appreciated that the rib may be provided in any suitable location. For example, the rib may have a rear side that terminates prior to the end wall <b>224</b>. Accordingly, for example, the rib could extend rearward from the front end of the air impermeable portion <b>424</b> or rearward from a location rearward of the air impermeable portion <b>424</b> and may terminate at or forward of the rear wall <b>224</b>. As exemplified, the rib <b>420</b> extends into the air treatment chamber <b>210</b> from the air treatment chamber rear wall <b>224</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0198" num="0207">The rib <b>420</b> may also extend inwardly, e.g., radially inwardly, from a sidewall <b>220</b> of the air treatment chamber and/or the air impermeable portion <b>424</b>. As exemplified, the rib <b>420</b> extends into the air treatment chamber <b>210</b> from the cyclone sidewall <b>220</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0199" num="0208">As exemplified, the rib <b>420</b> is positioned between the air treatment outlet <b>232</b> and the cyclone sidewall <b>220</b>. Accordingly, the rib <b>420</b> is radially outward from the outlet air impermeable portion <b>424</b>. The rib may have a radial width equal to the distance from the impermeable portion <b>424</b> to the sidewall <b>220</b> or a distance that is smaller. Accordingly, the radial inner side of the rib may terminate prior to the impermeable portion <b>424</b> and/or the radial outer side of the rib <b>420</b> may terminate prior to the sidewall <b>220</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0200" num="0209">Optionally, as exemplified, the impermeable portion <b>242</b> faces the rib <b>420</b>. It will be appreciated that only the portion of the outlet that faces the rib <b>420</b> need be air impermeable. Accordingly, the impermeable portion <b>244</b> may extend circumferentially at least 10&#xb0;, at least 20&#xb0;, or at least 30&#xb0; from the location of the rib <b>420</b>. The impermeable portion <b>244</b> may lead the rib <b>420</b> (i.e., begins upstream of the rib) in a direction of cyclonic flow within the chamber by at least 1&#xb0;, at least 2&#xb0;, or at least 5&#xb0;.</p>
<p id="p-0201" num="0210">As exemplified, the rear end of the air treatment chamber <b>210</b> is located at the end wall on which the air treatment outlet <b>232</b> (vortex finder <b>238</b>) is provided. This allows the pre-motor filter <b>330</b> to have a larger size in a direction transverse to the longitudinal axis (e.g., a larger diameter) than if the air treatment chamber <b>210</b> extended to a position rearward of the front end of the pre-motor filter <b>330</b>, which allows for the axial length of the surface cleaning apparatus <b>100</b> to be shortened. Alternately, the rear end of the air treatment chamber <b>210</b> may be rearward of the rear end of the vortex finder, in which case, the rear end of the rib <b>420</b> may extend rearward of the vortex finder to or towards the rear end of the air treatment chamber.</p>
<p id="p-0202" num="0211">The rib <b>420</b> may extend in a generally axial direction. As exemplified, the rib <b>420</b> may be a planar body extending in a plane that is generally parallel to the air treatment longitudinal axis <b>218</b> (e.g., the cyclone axis of rotation). The rib <b>420</b> extends to a rib axially inner end <b>442</b>. As exemplified, the rib axially inner end <b>442</b> may be closer to the front end of the air treatment chamber <b>210</b> than the opposite end of the rib <b>420</b>. Optionally, as exemplified, the rib axially inner end <b>442</b> is curved. The curved end extends further into the air treatment chamber <b>210</b> on a radially outer side <b>444</b> of the rib <b>420</b> than on a radially inner side <b>446</b> of the rib <b>20</b>. As exemplified, the rib axially inner end <b>442</b> may include a rounded curve between a radially inner side <b>446</b> and an axially innermost edge <b>448</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0203" num="0212">Optionally, the rib <b>420</b> has an axial length <b>450</b> of 4 mm to 50 mm, 8 mm to 25 mm, or, optionally, 12 mm to 18 mm. The outlet air impermeable portion <b>424</b> may have an axial length <b>452</b> of 0 mm to 50 mm, 0 mm to 25 mm, or, optionally, 0 mm to 15 mm. Optionally, the rib <b>420</b> has a radial height <b>454</b> that is equal to or a fraction of the radial distance <b>456</b> between the outlet air impermeable portion <b>424</b> and the chamber sidewall <b>220</b>. The rib <b>420</b> may have a height <b>454</b> of 0.1 to 1 times the radial distance <b>456</b>, 0.25 time to 0.75 times the radial distance <b>456</b>, or, preferably, 0.4 times to 0.6 times the radial distance <b>456</b>. However, it will be appreciated that the rib <b>420</b> may be provided in any suitable shape and size.</p>
<p id="p-0204" num="0213">It will also be appreciated that the assembly <b>200</b> may include one or more ribs. Where the assembly <b>200</b> includes a plurality of discrete ribs, the ribs may be angularly spaced apart about the cyclone axis of rotation <b>218</b>. Additionally, or alternatively, the ribs may be angularly spaced apart about the air treatment outlet <b>232</b>. The ribs <b>420</b> may be evenly spaced apart, may be of the same or different sizes and may be provided on the same or different walls.</p>
<p id="p-0205" num="0000">Air Inlet with a Side Opening</p>
<p id="p-0206" num="0214">The following is a description of air inlet with a side opening that may be used by itself or in combination with one or more of the rib arrester, the variable area inlet downstream opening, the curved closure member, the axially moving closure member, the withdrawable closure member, the closure member moved by a driving member, the openable chamber first end, the axially moveable chamber end, moving using fluid pressure, positioning of the user interface, the filter removeable past the user interface, the radially-removeable post-motor filter, the nested filter, the porous air treatment outlet, the ultraviolet disinfection, and the dirt scoop, which are set out herein.</p>
<p id="p-0207" num="0215">In accordance with this aspect, the air inlet <b>230</b> of an air treatment chamber, which may be a cyclone chamber, has a side opening. The air inlet may comprise an axial extending conduit, such as inlet conduit <b>170</b> which has an opening in the axial extending sidewall thereof. In such a case, the external conduit, when provided, may have a downstream end that terminates forward of (upstream of) the sidewall opening. Alternately, the side opening <b>474</b>, <b>476</b> may be in external conduit sidewall <b>146</b> (see, e.g., <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>17</b></figref>). Accordingly, when the external conduit <b>140</b> is inserted into the dirty air inlet, the sidewall opening may open onto the air treatment chamber (e.g., there may be no internal conduit <b>170</b> or the internal conduit <b>170</b> may terminate forward of or upstream of the downstream end of the portion of the external conduit <b>140</b> with the sidewall opening). It will be appreciated that if an inlet conduit <b>170</b> with a sidewall opening is also provided with a sidewall opening of the external conduit sidewall <b>146</b>, then the sidewall opening of the external conduit sidewall <b>146</b> and the sidewall opening of the inlet conduit <b>170</b> are preferable aligned during use of the surface cleaning apparatus.</p>
<p id="p-0208" num="0216">If a sidewall opening of the external conduit sidewall <b>146</b> is provided, then the external conduit <b>140</b> may have an inlet end wall <b>262</b> at a downstream end thereof. Such an end wall may close of the downstream end of the external conduit such that the sidewall opening(s) are the only air outlet. In such a case, the inlet end wall <b>262</b> may provide rigidity to the downstream end of the external conduit.</p>
<p id="p-0209" num="0217">If the air flow conduit (external conduit <b>140</b> and/or internal conduit <b>170</b>) has a closed end, e.g., inlet end wall <b>262</b> or external conduit end wall <b>270</b>, then part of the sidewall opening may comprise an air permeable section <b>460</b> (e.g., mesh may be provided to cover part of the sidewall opening). For example, two sidewall openings may be provided, which may be on opposed sides of the air flow conduit. In such a case, one of the sidewall openings may be provided with an air permeable section <b>460</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0210" num="0218">If the air flow conduit (external conduit <b>140</b> and/or internal conduit <b>170</b>) has an open end, then part or all of the sidewall opening may comprise an air permeable section <b>460</b>. One or more air permeable sections <b>460</b> may be provided upstream of the inlet downstream opening <b>258</b> in a sidewall of the inlet conduit <b>170</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0211" num="0219">In any embodiment, the air permeable section <b>460</b> may extend to the downstream end of the air flow conduit (e.g., inlet end wall <b>262</b> if the air flow conduit has a closed downstream end) or may terminate upstream thereof.</p>
<p id="p-0212" num="0220">The following is a discussion of an inlet conduit with a side opening wherein the external conduit terminates forward of the sidewall opening. It will be appreciated that the same features may be used with an external conduit with a sidewall opening.</p>
<p id="p-0213" num="0221">If the inlet downstream opening <b>258</b> into the air treatment chamber is only through the sidewall, then the inlet downstream end <b>252</b> may include an inlet end wall <b>262</b>. The inlet sidewall <b>260</b> may extend along part or all of the inlet longitudinal axis and may optionally extend forwardly from the end wall <b>262</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0214" num="0222">The inlet end wall <b>262</b> may extend across the inlet longitudinal axis <b>254</b> and may close off the downstream end of the inlet sidewall <b>260</b>. The inlet end wall <b>262</b> may optionally be planar, and may optionally extend generally perpendicular to the inlet longitudinal axis <b>254</b>. The inlet end wall <b>262</b> may be removeable from the inlet sidewall in some embodiments.</p>
<p id="p-0215" num="0223">As exemplified in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>6</b></figref>, the inlet upstream opening <b>256</b> may include or consist of the chamber inlet opening <b>234</b> (i.e., the upstream end of the conduit leading to the sidewall opening or provided at the upstream end of the sidewall opening) and the inlet downstream opening <b>258</b> may include or consist of an opening (e.g., a sidewall opening) in a projecting conduit sidewall <b>248</b> of the projecting conduit <b>240</b>. The inlet sidewall <b>260</b> may include or consist of the projecting conduit sidewall <b>248</b>, and the inlet end wall <b>262</b> may include or consist of a projecting conduit end wall <b>264</b> of the projecting conduit.</p>
<p id="p-0216" num="0224">Alternately, as exemplified in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>20</b>, <b>22</b>, and <b>23</b></figref>, the air treatment inlet <b>230</b> includes the external conduit <b>140</b> that is removably received in the projecting conduit <b>240</b>, and the diameter of the inlet upstream opening <b>256</b> is limited by the inner diameter of the external conduit <b>140</b>, while the inlet downstream opening is limited by the overlapping portions of downstream openings <b>474</b>, <b>476</b> in the external conduit <b>140</b> and the projecting conduit <b>240</b>.</p>

<p id="p-0218" num="0226">The external conduit end wall <b>270</b> may be a removeable end wall or cap, although it will be appreciated that if the external conduit <b>140</b> is received in the projecting conduit <b>240</b> and the projecting conduit <b>240</b> includes the projecting conduit end wall <b>264</b>, the external conduit <b>140</b> may not require an end wall or end cap to direct airflow through sidewall openings and may not include an end wall or end cap closing the end of the external conduit sidewall <b>146</b>. However, the end cap <b>270</b> may provide greater structural strength to the downstream end of the external conduit <b>140</b>. In some embodiments, the external conduit <b>140</b> is made of metal. Optionally, the external conduit <b>140</b> is a thin-walled conduit. The external conduit sidewall <b>146</b> may be a thin wall formed of metal. The external conduit end cap <b>270</b> may support the end of the external conduit <b>140</b> in embodiments in which one or more openings <b>474</b>, <b>476</b> are formed in the sidewall, particularly where the openings extend to the downstream end of the external conduit sidewall <b>146</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0219" num="0227">It will also be appreciated that the inlet end wall <b>262</b> and/or inlet sidewall <b>260</b> may include an alternative member, such as a further body received within the external conduit <b>140</b> and/or the projecting conduit <b>240</b>, such as a moveable inlet member <b>280</b> as discussed further elsewhere herein.</p>
<p id="p-0220" num="0228">Referring again to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>5</b> and <b>6</b></figref>, the projecting conduit <b>240</b> extends between a projecting conduit inlet end <b>266</b> and a projecting conduit outlet end <b>268</b>. The chamber inlet opening <b>234</b> is at the projecting conduit inlet end <b>266</b>. The chamber inlet opening <b>234</b> may be an opening in a chamber end wall, such as the chamber first end wall <b>222</b> as exemplified. The projecting conduit <b>240</b> also includes a projecting conduit outlet opening <b>282</b> at the projecting conduit outlet end <b>268</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0221" num="0229">The air treatment inlet <b>230</b> may be a hooked inlet. As exemplified, the projecting conduit inlet opening <b>284</b> and the projecting conduit outlet opening <b>282</b> may extend in non-parallel planes to change the direction of air flow along the apparatus air flow path <b>160</b>. The air treatment inlet <b>230</b> may also be a tangential inlet for a cyclone. As exemplified, the projecting conduit outlet opening <b>282</b> may extend generally parallel to the air treatment member longitudinal axis <b>204</b> (e.g., a cyclone axis). The projecting conduit outlet opening <b>282</b> may extend in a plane that is generally parallel to the air treatment member longitudinal axis <b>204</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0222" num="0230">In some embodiments, the air treatment inlet <b>230</b> has an effective air inlet length <b>290</b>, the effective air inlet length <b>290</b> being the axial length of the inlet downstream opening <b>258</b>.

The effective air inlet length <b>290</b> may be between 10 mm and 100 mm, between 25 mm and 75 mm, or, optionally, between 40 mm and 60 mm. The effective air inlet length <b>290</b> may be generally equal to the projecting length <b>242</b> when the projecting conduit outlet opening <b>282</b> extends the length of the projecting conduit, as exemplified in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>6</b></figref>.</p>

However, it will be appreciated that the porous material <b>464</b> may be any suitable porous material, such as foam or felt or a perforated wall.</p>
<p id="p-0231" num="0239">The air permeable section <b>460</b> and the inlet downstream opening <b>258</b> each open into the free volume <b>470</b> of the air treatment chamber <b>210</b>. Upon exiting either of the air permeable section <b>460</b> or the inlet downstream opening <b>258</b>, the air enters the free volume <b>470</b> of the air treatment chamber <b>210</b>. The air permeable section <b>460</b> forms a secondary pathway between the air treatment inlet <b>230</b> and the air treatment chamber <b>210</b>. This secondary pathway results in a reduction of the power required for the motor <b>322</b> to produce a given air flow rate.

<heading id="h-0010" level="2">Variable Area Inlet Downstream Opening</heading>
<p id="p-0241" num="0249">The following is a description of an inlet downstream opening <b>258</b> having a variable cross sectional area, which may be used by itself or in combination with one or more of the rib arrester, the air inlet with a side opening, the curved closure member, the axially moving closure member, the withdrawable closure member, the closure member moved by a driving member, the openable chamber first end, the axially moveable chamber end, moving using fluid pressure, positioning of the user interface, the filter removeable past the user interface, the radially-removeable post-motor filter, the nested filter, the porous air treatment outlet, the ultraviolet disinfection, and the dirt scoop, which are set out herein.</p>
<p id="p-0242" num="0250">In accordance with this aspect, as exemplified in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>21</b> to <b>23</b></figref>, the inlet downstream opening <b>258</b> of the air treatment inlet <b>230</b> has a variable cross sectional area. The inlet downstream opening <b>258</b> has a cross sectional area that is variable between a first cross sectional area and a second cross sectional area that is less than the first cross sectional area. The size of the cross sectional area of the inlet downstream opening <b>258</b> may be varied to change the separation characteristics of the surface cleaning apparatus <b>100</b>, such as to change backpressure or to change the ratio between the effective air inlet length <b>290</b> and the chamber axial length <b>292</b>. As discussed elsewhere herein, the ratio between the effective air inlet length <b>290</b> and the chamber axial length <b>292</b> affects the number of turns that air passing through the cyclone chamber is subject to, and so affects the efficiency of the surface cleaning apparatus <b>100</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0243" num="0251">Accordingly, the first cross sectional area may have a first effective air inlet length and the second cross sectional area may have a second effective air inlet length that is less than the first effective air inlet length. Air flowing through a cyclone may have a greater number of turns in the cyclone chamber <b>210</b> when the inlet downstream opening <b>258</b> has the second, shorter effective air inlet length rather than the first effective air inlet length.</p>
<p id="p-0244" num="0252">It will be appreciated that the cross sectional area of a sidewall inlet may be changed in any suitable way. In some embodiments, the air treatment inlet <b>230</b> is reconfigured by moving a moveable inlet member <b>280</b> of the air treatment inlet <b>230</b> to adjust the size of the cross sectional area (e.g., axial length) of the inlet downstream opening <b>258</b>. It will be appreciated that the cross sectional area of the inlet downstream opening <b>258</b> may vary as the moveable inlet member <b>280</b> moves. The moveable inlet member <b>280</b> may be moveable between a first member position in which the inlet downstream opening <b>258</b> has a first cross sectional area and a second member position in which the inlet downstream opening <b>258</b> has a second cross sectional area that is less than the first cross sectional area.</p>
<p id="p-0245" num="0253">The moving member <b>280</b> may be any suitable member. For example, in embodiments in which the air treatment inlet <b>230</b> includes one conduit (e.g., external conduit <b>140</b>) received within another (e.g., inlet conduit <b>170</b>) with the inlet downstream opening <b>258</b> formed by overlapping sidewall openings of the conduits, one conduit may be the moveable inlet member <b>280</b> and may be adjusted within the other to change the size (e.g., axial length) of the inlet downstream opening <b>258</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0246" num="0254">Alternatively, as exemplified in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>21</b> to <b>23</b></figref>, the moveable inlet member <b>280</b> may be a blocking member receivable within a conduit of the air treatment inlet <b>230</b>. The blocking member blocks off a portion of the conduit to force the air flow path <b>160</b> out of a sidewall outlet of a conduit upstream of the blocking member. For example, the blocking member may be an end wall <b>262</b>, <b>270</b>. Alternately, it will be appreciated that the moveable inlet member <b>280</b> may be or include the closure member <b>310</b>, or the closure member <b>310</b> may include the moveable inlet member <b>280</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0247" num="0255">The moveable inlet member <b>280</b> may be moveable from a first member position to a second member position. In the first position, the moveable inlet member <b>280</b> may block or partially block the downstream end of a conduit and in the second position, the moveable inlet member <b>280</b> may open or partially open the downstream end of a conduit. Accordingly, adjusting the position of the moveable inlet member <b>280</b> may adjust the amount of air exiting axially out of the downstream end of a conduit and the amount exiting through a sidewall opening of a conduit. Alternately, the first position may be upstream of the second position whereby, as the moveable inlet member <b>280</b> is moved from a second downstream position to a first upstream position, the length of a sidewall outlet is shortened.</p>
<p id="p-0248" num="0256">It will be appreciated that the moveable inlet member <b>280</b> may be moveable in any suitable way. The movable member <b>280</b> may be moveable between a position in an air inlet conduit of the air treatment chamber and a position removed therefore. For example, the moveable member may move about a pivot axis or along a liner path (e.g., a radial path with respect to the air treatment member longitudinal axis) between a position received in the projecting conduit <b>240</b> and/or the external conduit <b>140</b> and a position removed from within the projecting conduit <b>240</b> and/or the external conduit <b>140</b>. Alternately, or in addition, the moveable inlet member <b>280</b> may be axially moveable parallel to the air treatment member longitudinal axis <b>204</b> and/or the inlet conduit axis <b>174</b>. The moveable inlet member <b>280</b> is moveable to a position at which it blocks off a portion of a sidewall opening that would otherwise be available to the air flow path <b>160</b> and may therefore be referred to as a blocking member.</p>
<p id="p-0249" num="0257">The moveable inlet member <b>280</b> may form a terminal end <b>490</b> of the air treatment inlet <b>230</b> or of the external conduit <b>140</b> or of any conduit in which it is provided.</p>
<p id="p-0250" num="0258">As exemplified in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>21</b> to <b>23</b></figref>, the inlet downstream opening <b>258</b> may extend to the moveable inlet member <b>280</b> when the moveable inlet member <b>280</b> is in it downstream position (see <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>22</b></figref>). In this position, the moveable inlet member <b>280</b> forms an end wall of the air treatment inlet <b>230</b> at the outlet end thereof, and extends transverse to a flow direction of air through the upstream portion of the air treatment inlet <b>230</b>. As the moveable inlet member <b>280</b> moves to its upstream position, the length of the inlet downstream opening <b>258</b> is shortened whereby the effective air inlet length <b>290</b> of the inlet downstream opening <b>258</b> is varied.</p>
<p id="p-0251" num="0259">The moveable inlet member may be part of the air treatment assembly and may be slideable receivable in the external conduit <b>140</b> when the external conduit <b>140</b> is inserted into the dirty air inlet. Accordingly, when the external conduit <b>140</b> is inserted into the dirty air inlet and the moveable member is at its axially inner (rearward) position, the moveable inlet member <b>280</b> may extend across the downstream end of the external conduit <b>140</b> to close off an internal passage of the external conduit <b>140</b> through which the air flow path <b>160</b> extends, effectively forming an end wall thereof. Alternately, the moveable inlet member <b>280</b> may be a moveable inlet end wall <b>262</b> of the external conduit <b>140</b> (e.g., a wand). Optionally, the moveable inlet member <b>280</b> may be part of the external conduit end cap <b>270</b> of the external conduit. As such, it may be removable with the external conduit from the surface cleaning apparatus. Alternately, if the external conduit <b>140</b> does not extend into the surface cleaning apparatus to the upstream (forward) position of the moveable member <b>280</b>, then the moveable member may move within the inlet conduit <b>170</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0252" num="0260">As exemplified in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>24</b> to <b>26</b></figref>, the moveable inlet member <b>280</b> may be received within the projecting conduit <b>240</b>. The moveable inlet member <b>280</b> may extend across the projecting conduit <b>240</b> to close off an internal passage of the projecting conduit <b>240</b> or a portion thereof through which the air flow path <b>160</b> extends. Accordingly, the moveable inlet member <b>280</b> may direct air that is traveling through the air flow path <b>160</b> to exit the projecting conduit <b>240</b> through a sidewall outlet that is located upstream of the moveable inlet member <b>280</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0253" num="0261">In some embodiments, as exemplified in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>24</b> and <b>25</b></figref>, the moveable inlet member <b>280</b> may move along a moveable member track <b>492</b>. The track <b>492</b> may be or include, e.g., a rail. The moveable member track <b>492</b> may extend axially (i.e., parallel to the air treatment longitudinal axis <b>218</b>). The moveable member track <b>492</b> may be fixed to, or built into, the chamber sidewall <b>220</b>, and may optionally extend only within the air treatment inlet <b>230</b>. The moveable member track <b>492</b> may be a linear rail, which may be provided in the inner side of the sidewall.</p>
<p id="p-0254" num="0262">The cross sectional area may be changed automatically or manually, or the surface cleaning apparatus <b>100</b> may be configured such that both automatic and manual options are available. In embodiments in which the air treatment inlet <b>230</b> includes a moveable member <b>280</b>, the moveable inlet member <b>280</b> may be moved manually and/or automatically. For example, the moveable member may be moved by a manually moved mechanical link, air pressure or suction caused by the suction motor, and/or a further motor or a solenoid that is provided in addition to the suction motor, including any of the mechanisms described herein.</p>
<p id="p-0255" num="0263">The moveable inlet member <b>280</b> may move in response to pressure changes within the surface cleaning apparatus <b>100</b>, such as within the air treatment inlet <b>230</b> and/or the free volume <b>470</b> of the air treatment chamber <b>210</b>. Optionally, the moveable inlet member <b>280</b> moves to keep the pressure at a constant level. For example, if air pressure drops (due to dirt accumulating on a pre-motor filter or the screen of the vortex finder in a cyclone chamber), then the movable member <b>280</b> may move to increase the cross sectional area of the inlet downstream opening <b>258</b> thereby reducing the back pressure through the opening <b>258</b> and offsetting or partially offsetting the air pressure drop. This may assist in maintaining cyclonic flow as despite the pressure drop.</p>
<p id="p-0256" num="0264">As exemplified in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>25</b> and <b>26</b></figref>, the moveable inlet member <b>280</b> may be manually moveable. Alternately, the moveable member may be automatically moved in response to a change of pressure or air flow through the surface cleaning apparatus. Accordingly, for example, one or more pressure or air flow sensors may be provided in the air flow path and upon issuance of a signal from one or more sensors, the position of the moveable member may be changed, e.g., by a solenoid or stepper motor.</p>
<p id="p-0257" num="0265">An actuator <b>502</b> may be provided to control the movement of the moveable inlet member <b>280</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0258" num="0266">As exemplified in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>24</b> and <b>25</b></figref>, the actuator <b>502</b> is a manually moveable toggle <b>500</b>, which may be on a surface of the main body <b>120</b>. For example, the manual toggle <b>500</b> may be a mechanical slider, as exemplified. The manual toggle <b>500</b> is provided to be manually manipulated (e.g., slid) by a user. The user may move the manual toggle <b>500</b> between a first toggle position (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>24</b></figref>) and a second toggle position (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>25</b></figref>). Moving the manual toggle <b>500</b> between the first toggle position and the second toggle position may move the moveable inlet member <b>280</b> between the first member position and the second member position.</p>
<p id="p-0259" num="0267">The manual toggle <b>500</b> is drivingly coupled to the moveable inlet member <b>280</b> to move the moveable inlet member <b>280</b> between the first member position and the second member position</p>
<p id="p-0260" num="0268">The manual toggle <b>500</b> may be mechanically linked directly to the moveable inlet member <b>280</b> such that moving the manual toggle <b>500</b> pushes and/or pulls the moveable inlet member <b>280</b>. In some embodiments, the when the manual toggle <b>500</b> is in the first toggle position the moveable inlet member <b>280</b> is in the first member position, and when the manual toggle <b>500</b> is in the second toggle position the moveable inlet member <b>280</b> is in the second member position. Accordingly, the manual toggle <b>500</b> may be a body that is directly secured to the moveable inlet member <b>280</b> as exemplified in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>25</b> and <b>26</b></figref> (e.g., molded as part thereof).</p>
<p id="p-0261" num="0269">Alternatively, as exemplified in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>27</b> and <b>28</b></figref>, the manual toggle <b>500</b> may be mechanically drivingly coupled to the moveable inlet member <b>280</b> via mechanical coupling <b>504</b>. Manual toggle <b>500</b> may therefore be an actuator <b>502</b> that may be a body that is directly secured to a mechanical linkage <b>504</b> that is directly secured to the moveable inlet member <b>280</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0262" num="0270">Alternately, an actuator <b>502</b> which actuates an electromechanical member, such as a motor (e.g., a stepper motor) or a solenoid may be provided to move the moveable inlet member <b>280</b> between the first member position and the second member position. Such an actuator, which may be referred to as a powered actuator may be coupled to a power supply of the surface cleaning apparatus (e.g., a battery). A powered actuator may be communicatively coupled to the control system to be controlled thereby.</p>
<p id="p-0263" num="0271">Alternately, the actuator <b>502</b> may be an unpowered actuator such as, e.g., an aneroid capsule responsive to pressure changes. The moveable member actuator <b>502</b> may be controlled in any suitable way, such as by the manual toggle or automatically by signals generated by the control system <b>370</b> of the surface cleaning apparatus (e.g., in response to changes in pressure, changes in sensor values, or changes in operational modes).</p>
<p id="p-0264" num="0272">The moveable member actuator <b>502</b> may optionally be a dedicated actuator for controlling only the moveable inlet member <b>280</b>. Any actuator discussed herein may be used.</p>
<p id="p-0265" num="0273">Alternatively, moveable member actuator <b>502</b> may control another function of the surface cleaning apparatus <b>100</b> in addition to the moveable inlet member <b>280</b>. For example, the actuator <b>502</b> may be provided to control another setting of the surface cleaning apparatus <b>100</b> (i.e., presented to the user as being for the control of the other setting). For example, the actuator <b>502</b> may be a cleaning mode setting toggle (e.g., selecting between an above floor cleaning mode and a floor cleaning mode), and actuating the actuator <b>502</b> may select a mode of the surface cleaning apparatus <b>100</b>, and the moveable inlet member <b>280</b> may be adjusted to compliment the selected mode, as disused further elsewhere herein. In such a case, the surface cleaning apparatus <b>100</b> may not include any indicia indicating that the actuator <b>502</b> controls the moveable inlet member <b>280</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0266" num="0274">Alternatively, or additionally (e.g., indirectly, as discussed further elsewhere herein), the cross-sectional area of the inlet downstream opening <b>258</b> may be automatically varied based upon an air flow rate of air in the air flow path <b>160</b>. When the air flow rate is a first flow rate, the inlet downstream opening <b>258</b> has a first cross-sectional area and when the air flow rate is a second flow rate that is lower than the first flow rate, the inlet downstream opening <b>258</b> has a second cross-sectional area that is different from the first cross-sectional area and may be smaller. The air flow rate may vary the cross-sectional area directly and/or indirectly.</p>
<p id="p-0267" num="0275">The air flow rate may vary the cross sectional area directly, as the force of air impinging the moveable inlet member <b>280</b> may cause a change in the positioning of the moveable inlet member <b>280</b>. The moveable member may be biased to an upstream (forward) position. In such a case, if the first air flow rate is higher than the second air flow rate, then air impinging the moveable inlet member <b>280</b> at the first air flow rate (i.e., the higher air flow rate) may carry greater force and so moves the moveable inlet member <b>280</b> farther downstream (rearwardly) than air impinging the moveable inlet member <b>280</b> at the second air flow rate. Moving the moveable inlet member <b>280</b> farther downstream increases the axial length of the inlet downstream opening <b>258</b> and thereby enables a higher airflow into the air treatment member. Accordingly, the force of air may move the moveable inlet member <b>280</b> automatically to increase the axial length of the opening <b>258</b> and the biasing member (e.g., a spring) may move the moveable member to reduce the axial length of the opening <b>258</b> when the air flow rate decreases, all without user intervention.</p>
<p id="p-0268" num="0276">As exemplified in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>29</b> and <b>30</b></figref>, the surface cleaning apparatus <b>100</b> may include a biasing member <b>506</b> (e.g., a spring or compressible balloon) biasing the movable member <b>280</b> to a position that results in a smaller cross sectional area of the inlet downstream opening <b>258</b>. The moveable inlet member <b>280</b> may be biased towards the second member position (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>30</b></figref>) by the biasing member <b>506</b>, and the force of air impinging the moveable inlet member <b>280</b> may overcome the force of the biasing member <b>506</b> to move the moveable inlet member <b>280</b> all or part of the way to the first member position (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>29</b></figref>).</p>
<p id="p-0269" num="0277">Alternatively, or additionally, the cross sectional area of the inlet downstream opening <b>258</b> may vary automatically as the surface cleaning apparatus is reconfigured wherein the reconfiguration results in a change in the air flow rate. The change in air flow rate may be due to a change in power level provided to the suction motor and, accordingly, each of the air flow rate and the cross sectional area of the inlet downstream opening <b>258</b> may respond to a common input (e.g., a change in power level). Accordingly, the cross sectional area of the inlet downstream opening <b>258</b> and the air flow rate both respond to the same user action, such as a user activating a toggle, such as pushing a soft button (touch screen) or a hard button or moving a slider to change an operating mode of the surface cleaning apparatus (e.g., changing from a low flow mode to a high flow mode), or reconfiguring the surface cleaning apparatus <b>100</b>, such as mounting a portable unit to a floor cleaning unit <b>154</b> to form, e.g., a stick vacuum.</p>
<p id="p-0270" num="0278">For example, the surface cleaning apparatus <b>100</b> is removably mountable to the floor cleaning unit <b>154</b> whereby, when the surface cleaning apparatus <b>100</b> is mounted to the floor cleaning unit <b>154</b> the surface cleaning apparatus is operable in an upright vacuum cleaner mode and, when the portable cleaning unit is removed from the floor cleaning unit <b>154</b>, the portable cleaning unit is operable in an above floor (hand vac) cleaning mode. The above floor vacuum cleaner mode may comprise the first air flow rate, e.g., as a result of a first power level being supplied to the suction motor <b>322</b>. The upright vacuum cleaning mode may comprise the second air flow rate that is lower than the first air flow rate, e.g., as a result of a second power level being supplied to the suction motor <b>322</b> that is less than the first power level. The above floor cleaning mode may be a high-power mode and the upright cleaning mode may be a low-power mode, wherein a low-power mode may allow for a longer run time. If the power level of the suction motor <b>322</b> is automatically varied as an operating mode of the surface cleaning apparatus <b>100</b> is changed from the upright vacuum cleaner mode to the above floor cleaning mode, then the cross-section area of the air treatment inlet <b>230</b> may also be automatically varied as an operating mode of the surface cleaning apparatus is changed from the upright vacuum cleaner mode to the above floor cleaning mode.</p>
<p id="p-0271" num="0279">This change in the cross-sectional area may be due to the change in air flow as discussed previously. Alternately, the change may be due to the moveable member being moved by the insertion of the external conduit <b>140</b> driving the moveable member <b>280</b> to the upright vacuum cleaner mode and the moveable member returning to the hand vac cleaning mode when the external conduit <b>140</b> is removed. The external conduit may be driving connected to the moveable member upon insertion and a biasing member may return the moveable member to the hand vac cleaning mode upon withdrawal of the external conduit. Alternately, the change may be due to an electromechanical member moving the moveable member in response to mounting and removing the surface cleaning apparatus from the floor cleaning unit (e.g., insertion and/or removal of the external conduit).</p>
<p id="p-0272" num="0280">A lower power mode may result in a lower air flow rate which may result in a lower cyclone efficiency. The moveable inlet member <b>280</b> may be moved to decrease the axial length of a cyclone inlet to thereby to increase the number of turns of the air flow path <b>160</b> within the cyclone chamber <b>210</b>. The moveable inlet member <b>280</b> may be moved by any method discussed herein in response to the mode change or in response to the same user command that caused the mode change.</p>
<p id="p-0273" num="0281">Alternately, or in addition, the cross-sectional area of the inlet downstream opening <b>258</b> may be varied based on dirt characteristics in the surface cleaning apparatus. The dirt characteristics may be one or more of the size (i.e., particle size) of dirt which is collected, the size of dirt that is expected to be collected (e.g., based on a mode selection), the size of dirt that is carried by an air flow path <b>160</b> downstream of a selected component <b>510</b> of the surface cleaning apparatus, and the dirt loading of an air flow path downstream of the selected component <b>510</b> of the surface cleaning apparatus <b>100</b>. It will be appreciated that the selected component <b>510</b> referred to above may be the inlet conduit <b>170</b>, a dirt separating component such as the air treatment chamber <b>210</b>, the air treatment assembly <b>200</b> as a whole, or the pre-motor filter <b>330</b>. The cross sectional area of the inlet downstream opening <b>258</b> may be varied (e.g., the effective air inlet length <b>290</b> varied) to change (i.e., increase or decrease) the efficiency of the air treatment chamber <b>210</b>. For example, the effective air inlet length <b>290</b> may be reduced to produce more turns in a cyclone chamber and to thereby remove finer dirt from the air flow path <b>160</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0274" num="0282">For example, when dirt having a first size is collected the inlet downstream opening <b>258</b> may have the first cross-sectional area, and when dirt having a second size that is smaller than the first size is collected the inlet downstream opening <b>258</b> may have the second cross-sectional area. Alternately or in addition, when air downstream of the selected component <b>510</b> has a first dirt loading the inlet downstream opening <b>258</b> may have the first cross-sectional area, and when air downstream of the inlet downstream opening <b>258</b> has a second dirt loading that is higher than the first dirt loading the inlet downstream opening <b>258</b> may have the second cross-sectional area.</p>
<p id="p-0275" num="0283">It will be appreciated that dirt particle size or dirt loading may be determined in any suitable way, such as via a dirt sensor <b>512</b>, as exemplified in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>27</b> and <b>28</b></figref>, or via user observation. In some embodiments, the dirt sensor <b>512</b> is operable to detect a size of dirt in an air flow path <b>160</b> and/or the dirt collection region <b>300</b>. A dirt sensor <b>512</b> that is operable to detect a size of dirt in the air flow path <b>160</b> may be referred to as a dirt size sensor. The dirt sensor <b>512</b> may determine an average, mean, or minimum particle size of detected particles, and may base its output on that value. Alternatively, or additionally, in some embodiments the dirt sensor <b>512</b> is operable to detect a dirt loading of an airstream. A dirt sensor <b>512</b> that is operable to detect dirt loading of an air stream may be referred to as a dirt loading sensor. The dirt sensor <b>512</b> may determine a proportional volume of dirt in the air stream, and base its output on that value.</p>
<p id="p-0276" num="0284">It will be appreciated that the dirt sensor <b>512</b> may be any suitable sensor. In some embodiments, the dirt sensor <b>512</b> is an acoustic sensor (e.g., a microphone). For example, the output of the acoustic sensor may be used to gauge particle size. In some embodiments, the dirt sensor <b>512</b> is an optical sensor. In some embodiments, the dirt sensor <b>512</b> is a laser sensor.</p>
<p id="p-0277" num="0285">The dirt sensor <b>512</b> may be located at any suitable location of the surface cleaning apparatus <b>100</b>. In some embodiments, the surface cleaning apparatus <b>100</b> includes a dirt sensor <b>512</b> in, or arranged to detect dirt in (i.e., directed towards), the air treatment chamber, the dirt collection region <b>300</b> and/or in a dirt outlet between the dirt collection region <b>300</b> and an air treatment chamber <b>210</b>. In some embodiments, the surface cleaning apparatus <b>100</b> includes a dirt sensor <b>512</b> in the air flow path <b>160</b> (e.g., in the inlet <b>170</b>) or arranged to detect dirt travelling towards the air flow path <b>160</b> (e.g., in the external conduit <b>140</b>).</p>
<p id="p-0278" num="0286">In embodiments in which a dirt sensor <b>512</b> is in, or arranged to detect dirt in, the air flow path <b>160</b>, it will be appreciated that the dirt sensor may be in, or arranged to detect dirt in, any suitable location. That location may be within (e.g., as exemplified by sensor <b>512</b><i>a</i>, see <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>28</b></figref>) or downstream of the air treatment outlet <b>232</b>, such as within or downstream of the vortex finder <b>238</b>). That location may be at the air treatment chamber outlet end <b>216</b> upstream of the air treatment outlet <b>232</b>, or upstream of the pre-motor filter <b>330</b> (e.g., within the pre-motor filter housing <b>334</b> upstream of the pre-motor filter <b>330</b>, as exemplified by sensor <b>512</b><i>b</i>). That location may be upstream of the air treatment chamber, as exemplified by sensor <b>512</b><i>c</i>. In some embodiments, that location is downstream of the free volume <b>470</b> of the air treatment chamber <b>210</b>, downstream of the air treatment assembly <b>200</b> as a whole, and/or downstream of the pre-motor filter <b>330</b>, to detect changes in the size of dirt particles that are making it past these dirt separation components. It will be appreciated that any suitable number of dirt sensors may be used, and their outputs may be used in any suitable way, e.g., to send a signal which may be sent to a controller which in turns sends a signal to actuate an electromechanical member.</p>
<p id="p-0279" num="0287">A user may manually change the position of the moveable inlet member <b>280</b> due to changing dirt characteristics. For example, the surface cleaning apparatus <b>100</b> may generate an alert to prompt a user to adjust the position of the moveable inlet member <b>280</b> based upon a dirt characteristic that is determined. The alert may be, e.g., an audible alert played by a speaker of the apparatus, or a visual alert displayed on the apparatus (e.g., a flashing light or an illuminated icon). In use, the user may respond to the alert by using actuator <b>502</b> to move the moveable inlet member <b>280</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0280" num="0288">The alert may be generated in response to detecting a change in the size of dirt that is being collected or the size or amount of dirt that is travelling downstream of the air treatment chamber and/or the air treatment assembly. In some embodiments, the alert is generated in response to the output of the dirt sensor <b>512</b>. Alternatively, or additionally, the alert may be generated in response to a user action indicative that the surface cleaning apparatus <b>100</b> is being or will be used to collect dirt of a different size, such as switching a mode of operation (e.g., above floor vs. upright) or adding an attachment.</p>
<p id="p-0281" num="0289">Alternatively or in addition, the cross-sectional area of the inlet downstream opening <b>258</b> may be automatically varied due to changing dirt characteristics. The variation may be in response to an output of a dirt sensor <b>512</b> or in response to a user action indicative that the surface cleaning apparatus <b>100</b> is being or will be used to collect dirt of a different size or to a reconfiguration of the surface cleaning apparatus to a different cleaning mode. The moveable member actuator <b>502</b> may move the moveable inlet member <b>280</b> in response to an output from the dirt sensor <b>512</b> indicative of a change in the dirt characteristics (e.g., particle size or dirt loading of an air flow stream), or in response to a user mode selection or accessory attachment. For example, when an output of the dirt sensor <b>512</b> is indicative of finer dirt being detected, the moveable member actuator <b>502</b> may move the movable member <b>280</b> to shorten the effective air input length <b>290</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0282" num="0290">While in some embodiments the cross sectional area of the inlet downstream opening <b>258</b> changes in response to changes in the surface cleaning apparatus' operational mode, it will be appreciated that in some embodiments the cross sectional area of the inlet downstream opening <b>258</b> may also vary within a single mode. For example, the cross sectional area of the inlet downstream opening <b>258</b> may vary during an upright mode if there is a change in dirt characteristics (e.g., a sensed change in dirt loading of an air stream). Similarly, the cross sectional area of the inlet downstream opening <b>258</b> may change during an above floor cleaning mode if there is a change in dirt characteristics (e.g., a sensed change in particle size).</p>

<p id="p-0303" num="0311">The following is a description of a closure member <b>310</b> that can be withdrawn from the air flow path. The closure member <b>310</b> may be at least partially moveable to close a port or into or through a recess or passage formed in a wall or by a plurality of walls of the air treatment member <b>202</b>. This aspect may be used by itself or in combination with one or more of the rib arrester, the air inlet with a side opening, the variable area inlet downstream opening, the curved closure member, the axially moving closure member, the closure member moved by a driving member, the openable chamber first end, the axially moveable chamber end, moving using fluid pressure, positioning of the user interface, the filter removeable past the user interface, the radially-removeable post-motor filter, the nested filter, the porous air treatment outlet, the ultraviolet disinfection, and the dirt scoop, which are set out herein.</p>
<p id="p-0304" num="0312">It will be appreciated the closure member <b>310</b> may be provided in any portion of the air flow path, optionally upstream of the air treatment assembly <b>200</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0305" num="0313">In accordance with this aspect, as exemplified in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>40</b> to <b>56</b></figref>, the air treatment assembly <b>200</b> has an assembly free volume <b>570</b> that includes the chamber free volume <b>470</b> of the air treatment chamber <b>210</b> and an inlet free volume <b>572</b> of the air treatment inlet <b>230</b>. The chamber free volume is an open space within the air treatment chamber <b>210</b> outside the air treatment inlet <b>230</b> and the air treatment outlet <b>232</b>. The inlet free volume <b>572</b> is an open space within the air treatment inlet <b>230</b> and that is part of the air flow path <b>160</b> when the closure member <b>310</b> is in the closed position.</p>
<p id="p-0306" num="0314">In the open position, the closure member <b>310</b> may be at least partially removed from the assembly free volume <b>570</b> or fully removed from the assembly free volume <b>570</b>. This aspect reduces the extent to which the closure member <b>310</b> inhibits air flow when in the open position and/or reduces turbulence caused by a significant discontinuity in the transverse cross sectional area of the air treatment inlet <b>230</b> at a downstream edge of the closure member <b>310</b> when the closure member <b>310</b> is in the open position.</p>
<p id="p-0307" num="0315">Optionally, when in the open position, the closure member <b>310</b> may be at least partially moved into or through a closure passage <b>574</b> (as exemplified in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>40</b> and <b>41</b></figref>) and may be at least partially or fully received in a closure recess (e.g., pocket <b>580</b>, exemplified in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>42</b> and <b>43</b></figref>) or it may be moved to close a port in a wall of the air flow path <b>160</b> (as exemplified in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>53</b> and <b>54</b></figref>). Optionally, the closure member <b>310</b> in the open position is fully received in the closure recess or fully moved into or through the closure passage <b>574</b> or moved to close a port and form a smooth wall section at the location of the port. It will be appreciated that the closure passage may be similar to the closure recess, but extending all the way through the wall or walls to an exterior of the air treatment assembly <b>200</b> (and, optionally, to an exterior of the surface cleaning apparatus <b>100</b>) such that the closure member <b>310</b> may be fully withdrawn from the air treatment assembly <b>200</b> through the closure passage.</p>
<p id="p-0308" num="0316">The closure recess may be formed in a single wall, e.g., a recess in a smooth and continuous surface which surface optionally continues a significant portion of the way around the recess (e.g., at least 50%, 75% or 90% of a perimeter of the recess). The closure recess may be formed between walls. The closure recess has a mouth or port which opens into the air flow path, such as into the chamber free volume <b>470</b> or into the inlet free volume <b>572</b>.

Optionally, the closure member pocket <b>580</b> is formed in an axially extending sidewall (i.e., extending generally parallel to the apparatus longitudinal axis <b>218</b>). However, as exemplified in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>53</b> and <b>54</b></figref>, it will be appreciated that the closure member pocket <b>580</b> may alternatively be formed in a sidewall <b>260</b> that does not extend axially.</p>
<p id="p-0310" num="0318">As exemplified in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>52</b></figref>, the closure member <b>310</b> may be at least partially withdrawn into a closure member pocket <b>580</b> formed in the inlet end wall <b>262</b>.

<p id="p-0311" num="0319">Optionally, the closure member <b>310</b> is withdrawn into a sidewall of a generally smooth-walled bore. The smooth-walled bore is optionally a generally linear bore.

As exemplified in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>42</b> and <b>43</b></figref>, the inlet conduit sidewall <b>178</b> may form the generally smooth-walled bore <b>568</b>, and the closure member pocket <b>580</b> may be formed in the inlet conduit sidewall <b>178</b> such that at least a portion of the closure member <b>310</b> may be withdrawn into the inlet conduit sidewall <b>178</b>. As exemplified in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>42</b> and <b>43</b></figref>, the nozzle <b>180</b> may have a closure member pocket <b>580</b> formed in a wall therein (e.g., in a sidewall thereof) such that at least a portion of the closure member <b>310</b> may be withdrawn into the nozzle wall. Although it will be appreciated that the pocket <b>580</b> may alternately be formed in a sidewall of the inlet <b>230</b> (e.g., a portion of the inlet conduit sidewall <b>178</b> that extends into the air treatment chamber). It will also be appreciated that, when in the closed position, the closure member <b>310</b> may form part of the smooth-walled bore <b>568</b> and may be continuous part thereof.</p>
<p id="p-0313" num="0321">As exemplified, the closure member pocket <b>580</b> may include at least a portion that is exterior to the assembly free volume <b>570</b>. The closure member pocket <b>580</b> may extend outward from the assembly free volume <b>570</b>. Optionally, the pocket may have a depth such that when in the closed position, the closure member may abut an inner surface of the wall defining the pocket <b>580</b> and may be flush with the smooth-walled bore <b>568</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0314" num="0322">At least a portion of the closure member <b>310</b> in the closed position may be positioned in the assembly free volume <b>570</b> or the air treatment inlet <b>230</b>.

<p id="p-0315" num="0323">As discussed previously, in the open position, the closure member <b>310</b> may merge with a wall of the air treatment assembly <b>200</b>.

Where the closure member <b>310</b> in the open member position merges with a wall of the air flow path, such as a wall of the air treatment assembly <b>200</b>, the closure member <b>310</b> in the open member position may be referred to as forming a portion of the wall of the air flow path, such as a wall of the air treatment assembly <b>200</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0316" num="0324">As exemplified, the closure member pocket <b>580</b> may have a mouth or pocket port <b>600</b> by which the closure member pocket <b>580</b> is open to the assembly free volume <b>570</b>.

<p id="p-0317" num="0325">The closure member <b>310</b> may be moveable between the open member position and the closed member position by rotating about the closure axis of rotation <b>540</b>, the closure axis of rotation is exterior to the assembly free volume <b>570</b>.

<p id="p-0319" num="0327">The following is a description of a driving member <b>630</b> that is operable to move the closure member <b>310</b>, which may be used by itself or in combination with one or more of the rib arrester, the air inlet with a side opening, the variable area inlet downstream opening, the curved closure member, the axially moving closure member, the withdrawable closure member, the openable chamber first end, the axially moveable chamber end, moving using fluid pressure, positioning of the user interface, the filter removeable past the user interface, the radially-removeable post-motor filter, the nested filter, the porous air treatment outlet, the ultraviolet disinfection, and the dirt scoop, which are set out herein.</p>
<p id="p-0320" num="0328">In accordance with this aspect, as exemplified in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>34</b> to <b>39</b></figref>, the surface cleaning apparatus <b>100</b> includes a driving member <b>630</b> drivingly connected to the closure member <b>310</b>.

The closure member <b>310</b> may move in a second direction <b>634</b> from the closed position to the open position. The driving member <b>630</b> may be operable to move the closure member <b>310</b> in at least one of the first and second directions. Optionally, the driving member <b>630</b> is operable to move the closure member <b>310</b> in both the first direction <b>632</b> and the second direction <b>634</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0321" num="0329">Optionally, the driving member is operable to move the closure member from the open member position to the closed member position, and the closure member is biased to the open member position by a biasing member.

Optionally, the driving member is operable to move the closure member from the closed member position to the open member position, and the closure member is biased to the closed member position by a biasing member. The driving member <b>630</b> may move the closure member to the closed member position when activated, and the biasing member may move the closure member form the closed member position to the open member position when the driving member is not activated.</p>
<p id="p-0322" num="0330">It will be appreciated that the driving member <b>630</b> may be any suitable driving member, including any of the driving members described herein.</p>
<p id="p-0323" num="0331">The driving member <b>630</b> may be any actuator that is operatively connected to (e.g., drivingly connected to) the closure member <b>310</b> to move the closure member <b>310</b> in at least one direction in response to an event, such as one or more of the suction motor being actuated or deenergized, the surface cleaning apparatus being connected to or removed from a floor cleaning unit and the air treatment assembly or a subcomponent thereof being removed or reinstalled in the surface cleaning apparatus. It will be appreciated that the closure member <b>310</b> may be automatically moved upon the occurrence of an event. The actuation of the movement of the closure member may be controlled automatically by signals generated by the control system <b>370</b> of the surface cleaning apparatus <b>100</b> (e.g., in response to changes in pressure, changes in sensor values, or changes in operational modes).</p>
<p id="p-0324" num="0332">Accordingly, the driving member may be mechanically or electromechanically or fluidically connected to the closure member <b>310</b> to move the closure member upon the occurrence of the event.</p>
<p id="p-0325" num="0333">The driving member <b>630</b> may comprise a closure member actuator <b>640</b>, as exemplified in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>34</b> and <b>35</b></figref>. The closure member actuator <b>640</b> may be any suitable actuator. The closure member actuator <b>640</b> may act only on the closure member <b>310</b>, e.g., it may be a separate actuator from the actuator for the suction motor <b>322</b>, may therefore be a dedicated actuator for controlling only the closure member <b>310</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0326" num="0334">The closure member actuator <b>640</b> may be a powered actuator. A powered actuator may be an electromechanical actuator, such as a motor or solenoid. A powered actuator may be coupled to a power supply of the surface cleaning apparatus (e.g., a battery). A powered actuator may be a linear actuator. A powered actuator may be communicatively coupled to the control system to be directed thereby. Accordingly, upon actuation (e.g., a button being pushed, a soft control on a touch screen being touched or an event occurring, a signal may be sent to the closure member actuator <b>640</b> whereupon the closure member <b>310</b> is moved.</p>
<p id="p-0327" num="0335">Alternately, an unpowered actuator may be used. The unpowered actuator may be any such actuator discussed herein such as an aneroid capsule responsive to pressure changes or a closure mechanical coupling (a mechanical linkage) <b>646</b> drivingly coupled to the manually moveable toggle <b>642</b>. The closure mechanical coupling <b>646</b> mechanically drivingly couples an upline apparatus <b>648</b> (e.g., any actuator disclosed herein) to the closure member <b>310</b>. The upline apparatus <b>648</b> may be any actuator discussed elsewhere herein, and may be manually actuated by a user or may be actuated automatically upon the occurrence of an event.</p>
<p id="p-0328" num="0336">The closure member actuator <b>640</b> may itself comprise an on/off actuator <b>650</b> (see for example <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>34</b> and <b>35</b></figref>). Optionally, the on/off actuator <b>650</b> may be a toggle such as a button, pivoting switch or slider. The toggle may be manually moveable (e.g., a depressible button, pivoting switch or slider), or electronically activated (e.g., a soft button, such as presented on a touchscreen). The on/off actuator <b>650</b> may be the manually moveable toggle <b>642</b>. In some embodiments, the on/off actuator <b>650</b> is operable to actuate the suction motor <b>322</b> when the on/off actuator <b>650</b> is set to on and which is operable to deenergize the suction motor <b>322</b> when the on/off actuator <b>650</b> is set to off. The closure member <b>310</b> may move from the open position to the closed position in response to the on/off actuator <b>650</b> being set to off. The closure member <b>310</b> may move from the closed position to the open position in response to the on/off actuator being set to on.</p>
<p id="p-0329" num="0337">As discussed with respect to actuator <b>502</b>, the on/off actuator <b>650</b> may be mechanically drivingly connected to the closure member <b>310</b>. In some embodiments, an on/off actuator <b>650</b> that is mechanically drivingly connected to the closure member <b>310</b> is a manually moveable slider. In embodiments in which the on/off actuator <b>650</b> is mechanically drivingly connected to the closure member <b>310</b>, the driving member <b>630</b> may include the on/off actuator <b>650</b> and the mechanical linkage <b>646</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0330" num="0338">Alternatively, or additionally, when the on/off actuator <b>650</b> is transitioned to on or to off, a signal may be issued which causes an electromechanical member <b>640</b> (e.g., the moveable member actuator <b>502</b>) to drive the closure member <b>310</b> to the open position or the closed position, respectively.</p>
<p id="p-0331" num="0339">Optionally, the closure member <b>310</b> may move in response to the on/off actuator <b>650</b> after a predetermined time delay. For example, the closure member <b>310</b> may be moved to the closed position after a closing time delay of between 0.1 seconds and 10 seconds, 1 seconds and 5 seconds, or 2 seconds and 4 seconds following the transition of the on/off actuator to off. Accordingly, the air flow produced by the suction motor may terminate or substantially terminate prior to the closure member moving to the closed position. Alternately or in addition, the closure member <b>310</b> may move to the open position after the on/off actuator <b>650</b> is moved to on with a lesser opening time delay than the opening time delay.</p>
<p id="p-0332" num="0340">Suction produced by the suction motor <b>322</b> may moves the driving member <b>630</b> which moves the closure member <b>310</b> from the closed position to the open position. Accordingly, the main on/off switch of the surface cleaning apparatus may be the on/off actuator <b>650</b>. As exemplified in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>38</b> and <b>39</b></figref>, the driving member <b>630</b> may include a piston <b>660</b> that is moveable between an open piston position and a closed piston position. The piston may be drivingly connected to (e.g., mechanically or fluidically connected to) the closure member such that the closure member is moved to the closed member position when the piston is in the closed piston position and is moved to the open member position when the piston is moved to the open piston position. The piston <b>660</b> may be moveable within a cylinder <b>662</b>. When the suction motor <b>322</b> is on, the suction generated by the suction motor <b>322</b> may drive the piston <b>660</b> to move, e.g., within the cylinder <b>662</b>. The piston <b>660</b> may be mechanically coupled to the closure member <b>310</b> to move the closure member as the piston moves. The driving member <b>630</b> may include the piston <b>660</b> and the closure mechanical linkage <b>646</b> between the piston and the closure member <b>310</b>. The piston may be biased (e.g., by biasing member <b>664</b>) to return to the closed position.</p>
<p id="p-0333" num="0341">Alternately or in addition, the driving member <b>630</b> may include the external conduit <b>140</b>. If an external conduit is removably insertable, then insertion of the external conduit <b>140</b> into the nozzle <b>180</b> may move the closure member <b>310</b>. The upstream end of the external conduit <b>140</b> may bear against the closure member <b>310</b> as the external conduit <b>140</b> is inserted into the nozzle, pushing the closure member <b>310</b> before it. For example, the closure member <b>310</b> may move axially to close the air treatment chamber <b>210</b> automatically when the external conduit <b>140</b> is removed. The air treatment inlet <b>230</b> may include an axially moving closure member <b>310</b> which slides closed when the external conduit <b>140</b> is removed and slides axially inwardly due to engagement between the upstream end of the external conduit <b>140</b> and the closure member <b>310</b> when the external conduit <b>140</b> is inserted.</p>
<p id="p-0334" num="0342">As exemplified by <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>36</b> and <b>37</b></figref>, the driving member <b>630</b> may comprise an engagement member <b>680</b> provided on the external conduit <b>140</b> (e.g., the end wall) and a driving actuator <b>682</b> that is operatively connected to the closure member <b>310</b> whereby upon insertion of the external conduit <b>140</b> into the dirty air inlet, the engagement member contacts the driving actuator <b>682</b> which moves the closure member from the closed position to the open position. The engagement member <b>680</b> may be, e.g., the end cap of the external conduit <b>140</b> or a downstream end of the sidewall of the external conduit <b>140</b>. The driving actuator <b>682</b> may include, e.g., a mating engagement member that is drivingly connected to the closure member (e.g., a physical body projecting from the closure member) to be impacted by the engagement member. The driving actuator <b>682</b> may include, e.g., a toggle communicatively coupled to the closure member actuator <b>640</b>, whereby the toggle is triggered by the engagement member to actuate the closure member actuator <b>640</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0335" num="0343">Optionally, the external conduit <b>140</b> includes a catch to engage the closure member <b>310</b> to draw the closure member <b>310</b> to the closed member position when the external conduit <b>140</b> is withdrawn.</p>
<p id="p-0336" num="0344">Optionally, mounting the surface cleaning apparatus <b>100</b> to the floor cleaning unit <b>154</b> moves the closure member <b>310</b> from the closed position to the open position, such as by the external conduit <b>140</b> being inserted into the dirty air inlet when the surface cleaning apparatus is mounted to the floor cleaning unit, or an electromechanical member being actuated upon the surface cleaning apparatus being mounted to the floor cleaning unit.</p>
<p id="p-0337" num="0345">Optionally, the closure member <b>310</b> may move to the open member position when the air treatment assembly <b>200</b> is coupled to the main body <b>120</b>, and moves to the closed member position when the air treatment assembly <b>200</b> is removed. A mechanical or electromechanical member may move the closure member <b>310</b> when the main body <b>120</b> and the air treatment assembly <b>200</b> are separated. The mechanical member may be, e.g., a physical catch or magnet on the main body <b>120</b> that engages the closure member <b>310</b> (e.g., a corresponding catch or magnet of the closure member) to drive the closure member to the open or closed position as the air treatment assembly <b>200</b> is joined to or removed from the main body <b>120</b>. The electromechanical member may be, e.g., the closure member actuator <b>640</b> which receives a signal to move the closure member <b>310</b> in response to detection that the air treatment assembly <b>200</b> is being removed from or coupled to the main body <b>120</b>. Optionally, the closure member <b>310</b> is biased to the open member positions by a biasing member. Optionally, removing the air treatment assembly <b>200</b> from the main body <b>120</b> overcomes the force of the biasing member to move the closure member <b>310</b> to the closed position. Optionally, the closure member <b>310</b> is biased to the closed member positions by a biasing member. Optionally, coupling the air treatment assembly <b>200</b> to the main body <b>120</b> overcomes the force of the biasing member to move the closure member <b>310</b> to the closed position.</p>

<p id="p-0338" num="0346">The following is a description of an air treatment chamber <b>210</b> wherein the chamber first end <b>214</b> is openable and a portion of the opposed end <b>216</b> is moveable (e.g., concurrently or subsequently). This aspect may be used by itself or in combination with one or more of the rib arrester, the air inlet with a side opening, the variable area inlet downstream opening, the curved closure member, the axially moving closure member, the withdrawable closure member, the closure member moved by a driving member, the axially moveable chamber end, moving using fluid pressure, positioning of the user interface, the filter removeable past the user interface, the radially-removeable post-motor filter, the nested filter, the porous air treatment outlet, the ultraviolet disinfection, and the dirt scoop, which are set out herein.</p>
<p id="p-0339" num="0347">In accordance with this aspect, the openable chamber first end <b>214</b>, which may be the forward end of the air treatment chamber or assembly, may be opened to enable the porous outlet member of the chamber (e.g., a vortex finder) to advance to a position wherein the porous member may be cleaned (e.g., to remove hair wrapped therearound) or removed for cleaning. The porous member may advance by itself or with other portions of the assembly, e.g., the rear (outlet) end of the assembly or chamber. The porous member may advance to a position proximate the open first end (the evacuation opening <b>410</b>) or outwardly of the open first end, i.e., part or all of the porous member may advance to a position outwardly of the open first end.</p>
<p id="p-0340" num="0348">As exemplified in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>59</b> to <b>61</b></figref>, at least a portion of an end of the air treatment chamber <b>210</b> is translatable generally parallel to the chamber longitudinal axis <b>218</b>, and will be referred to as an axially moveable end portion <b>680</b>. The axially moveable end portion is moveable between a first position (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>59</b></figref>) and a second position (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>61</b></figref>) that is axially spaced from the first position. Optionally, the second position is forward of the first position. The axially moveable end portion <b>680</b> may act as a plunger, e.g., to move debris through the chamber.</p>
<p id="p-0341" num="0349">Accordingly, at least a portion of the chamber first end <b>214</b> may be moveable between a closed operating position (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>55</b></figref>) in which the evacuation opening <b>410</b> is closed and an open position (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>56</b></figref>) in which the evacuation opening <b>410</b> is opened. In the open position, the moveable portion of the chamber first end <b>214</b> may be open such that dirt may move out of the dirt collection region <b>300</b> through the evacuation opening <b>410</b>. In the closed position, the moveable portion of the chamber first end <b>214</b> is closed to inhibit movement of dirt out of the dirt collection region <b>300</b> through the evacuation opening <b>410</b>. Accordingly, the open position of the moveable portion of the chamber first end <b>214</b> may be referred to as an open evacuation position.</p>
<p id="p-0342" num="0350">The moveable portion of the chamber first end <b>214</b> may comprise or consist of the front wall of the air treatment assembly (e.g., the chamber first end wall <b>222</b>), a portion of the front wall of the air treatment assembly (e.g., movable first end portion <b>388</b>, which may be a flap, see <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>50</b></figref>) or part or all of the front wall of the air treatment assembly and part of the sidewall thereof.

The moveable portion of the chamber first end <b>214</b> may be secured at a rotational mount <b>704</b> to a fixed wall of the air treatment assembly, such as the chamber sidewall <b>220</b> or a further portion of the chamber first end wall <b>222</b>. Accordingly, the moveable portion of the chamber first end <b>214</b> may pivot about an axis of the rotational mount <b>704</b> between the open position and the closed position.</p>
<p id="p-0344" num="0352">Alternately, or in addition, the moveable portion of the chamber first end <b>214</b> may be translationally moveable (see for example <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>60</b></figref>). The moveable portion of the chamber first end <b>214</b> may be mounted to a fixed wall of the air treatment assembly and/or the main body via a track, and may move along the track between the open and closed positions. The moveable portion of the chamber first end <b>214</b> may move linearly between the open and closed positions. The moveable portion of the chamber first end <b>214</b> may translate forwardly, as exemplified in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>59</b> to <b>61</b></figref>. Translational movement is described further elsewhere herein.</p>
<p id="p-0345" num="0353">Alternately, or in addition, the moveable portion of the chamber first end <b>214</b> may be inflatable and deflatable. Moving between the open and closed positions may include, or consist of, inflating or deflating a member that is drivingly connected to the moveable portion of the chamber first end <b>214</b>. When an inflatable member is inflated, the moveable portion of the chamber first end <b>214</b> may be closed, and when the inflatable member is deflated the moveable portion of the chamber first end <b>214</b> may be opened.</p>
<p id="p-0346" num="0354">It will be appreciated that the moveable portion of the chamber first end <b>214</b> may be moved by any suitable actuator and any actuator discussed herein may be sued. Accordingly, the surface cleaning apparatus may include a first end actuator to move the chamber first end <b>214</b>, which may any of the actuators described herein or a dedicated actuator. For example, the moveable portion of the chamber first end <b>214</b> is manually moveable, such as by a first end manually moveable member <b>670</b>. This manually moveable member may extend to an exterior of the surface cleaning apparatus <b>100</b>, and may be a slider or depressible button or pivotal switch. The first end manually movable member <b>670</b> may be drivingly coupled to the moveable portion of the chamber first end <b>214</b> to move the moveable portion of the chamber first end <b>214</b>. The manually moveable member may be moved by a user or moved by the docking station when the surface cleaning apparatus is docked. It will be appreciated that the first end manually moveable member <b>670</b> may be any of the manually moveable members described herein (e.g., the manually movable toggle <b>500</b>) or a dedicated member the movement of which only affects movement of the moveable portion of the chamber first end <b>214</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0347" num="0355">It will be appreciated that the moveable portion of the chamber first end <b>214</b> may be moved directly by a user. For example, a user may grasp the moveable portion of the chamber first end <b>214</b> and pull or push it. In such embodiments, the moveable portion of the chamber first end <b>214</b> may be referred to as a manually moveable member.</p>
<p id="p-0348" num="0356">Alternately, the moveable portion of the chamber first end <b>214</b> may be pneumatically moveable. The moveable portion of the chamber first end <b>214</b> may be arranged to be drawn between the open and closed positions by suction generated by the suction motor <b>322</b> or a suction motor of the docking station <b>390</b>. Pneumatical movement is described further elsewhere herein.</p>
<p id="p-0349" num="0357">Optionally, the moveable portion of the chamber first end <b>214</b> may be moved upon or subsequent to the surface cleaning apparatus being docked at a docking station <b>390</b>. For example, docking the surface cleaning apparatus <b>100</b> with the docking station <b>390</b> may move the moveable portion of the chamber first end <b>214</b> from the closed operating position to the open position. Optionally, a portion of the docking station drivingly engage the surface cleaning apparatus to open the moveable portion of the chamber first end <b>214</b> when the surface cleaning apparatus <b>100</b> is being docked. A mechanical linkage may be provided whereupon the docking station may push or pull the moveable portion of the chamber first end <b>214</b> open. The moveable portion of the chamber first end <b>214</b> maybe biased to the closed operating position. Undocking the surface cleaning apparatus <b>100</b> from the docking station <b>390</b> may move the moveable portion of the chamber first end <b>214</b> from the open position to the closed operating position. Alternately or in addition, a portion of the docking station <b>390</b> may be coupled to the moveable portion of the chamber first end <b>214</b> to close the chamber first end <b>214</b> when the surface cleaning apparatus <b>100</b> is being undocked. For example, a catch on the docking station <b>390</b> may pull a door shut or pull a component to a closed position as the surface cleaning apparatus <b>100</b> is pulled away from the docking station.</p>
<p id="p-0350" num="0358">The axially moveable end portion <b>680</b> may be at least a portion of the chamber second end <b>216</b> and may also include at least a portion of the chamber first end <b>214</b>. The chamber second end <b>216</b> may be moveable after or with the opening of the chamber first end <b>214</b>. Optionally, the chamber second end <b>216</b> may not be moveable while the chamber first end <b>214</b> remains closed.</p>
<p id="p-0351" num="0359">It will be appreciated that the surface cleaning apparatus <b>100</b> may include two axially moveable end portions <b>680</b>, i.e., at least a portion of the chamber first end <b>214</b> and at least a portion of the chamber second end <b>216</b>. For example, as exemplified in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>59</b>-<b>61</b></figref>, the first and second ends <b>214</b>, <b>216</b> may each translate forward. In embodiments in which the apparatus includes two axially moveable end portions <b>680</b>, the portions may be secured together such that one can be moved by moving another. One of the portions may be drivingly connected to the other portion. The portions may be connected by a linking member <b>734</b>. The linking member <b>734</b> may be a mechanical linkage. For example, the linking member <b>734</b> may include an arm, such as an arm of fixed length or a telescoping arm. The linking member <b>734</b> may include an electromechanical member. The electromechanical member of the linking member <b>734</b> may be responsive to movement of one position, and respond by moving the other simultaneously or sequentially (e.g., after a predetermined time delay or change in the separation distance <b>684</b>).</p>
<p id="p-0352" num="0360">Portions secured together may be fixed together with a constant separation distance <b>684</b> between them (e.g., translate together as one body), or may be separated by a variable separation distance <b>684</b>. For example, portions may be joined by a telescoping arm such that a range of separation distances are possible.</p>
<p id="p-0353" num="0361">The axially moveable end portion <b>680</b> may include the chamber second end wall <b>224</b> or a portion thereof and/or the air treatment outlet <b>232</b> or a portion thereof. The air treatment outlet <b>232</b> may include a porous member <b>422</b> (e.g., a screen or a pre-motor filter received in the air treatment outlet <b>232</b>) and the axially moveable end portion <b>680</b> may include at least a portion of the porous member <b>422</b>, and optionally the entire porous member.</p>
<p id="p-0354" num="0362">If a pre-motor filter is provided, then the axially moveable end portion <b>680</b> may include at least a portion of the pre-motor filter housing <b>334</b>, e.g., a forward portion <b>686</b> of the pre-motor filter housing and a laterally encircling wall <b>688</b>. Optionally, the axially moveable end portion <b>680</b> may not include an end wall <b>690</b> of the pre-motor filter housing <b>334</b> that is at an end of the pre-motor filter housing which is farthest from the chamber first end <b>214</b> (e.g., a rearward end of the pre-motor filter housing <b>334</b>, as exemplified).</p>
<p id="p-0355" num="0363">Alternately, or in addition, the axially moveable end portion <b>680</b> may include at least a portion of or the entirety of the suction motor housing <b>324</b> and accordingly the suction motor <b>322</b> may be moveable with the axially moveable end portion <b>680</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0356" num="0364">The axially moveable end portion <b>680</b> may be moveably secured to a supporting sidewall <b>692</b> of the air treatment assembly <b>200</b> and/or the main body <b>120</b>. As exemplified, the supporting sidewall <b>692</b> may include the chamber sidewall <b>220</b> and/or the main body sidewall <b>192</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0357" num="0365">The surface cleaning apparatus <b>100</b> may include, as exemplified, a track <b>730</b> along which the axially moveable end portion <b>680</b> moves. The axially moveable end portion <b>680</b> may slide along the track <b>730</b>. The track <b>730</b> may be a linear track <b>730</b>. The track <b>730</b> may be parallel to the supporting sidewall <b>692</b> of the surface cleaning apparatus <b>100</b>. The track <b>730</b> may be provided in the supporting sidewall <b>692</b>. For example, the track <b>730</b> may include a member embedded in the supporting sidewall <b>692</b>, or may include a channel formed in the supporting sidewall <b>692</b>. Optionally, the supporting sidewall <b>692</b> and the track <b>730</b> are each axially extending.</p>
<p id="p-0358" num="0366">The track <b>730</b> may include a sealing member <b>732</b> received between the axially moveable end portion <b>680</b> and a wall along which the axially moveable end portion <b>680</b> moves. The sealing member <b>732</b> may be, e.g., a felt sealing member. The sealing member <b>732</b> may separate the axially moveable end portion <b>680</b> from a wall (e.g., the chamber sidewall <b>220</b>) along which the axially moveable end portion slides. The sealing member <b>732</b> may be sandwiched between the axially moveable end portion <b>680</b> and the chamber sidewall <b>220</b> throughout the movement between the closed position and the open position.</p>
<p id="p-0359" num="0367">It will be appreciated that the track <b>730</b> may be a dedicated track along which an axially moveable end portion <b>680</b> moves, with a separate track provided for each axially moveable end portion. However, as exemplified, in some embodiments more than one axially moveable end portion is carried by a common track <b>730</b>. As exemplified, an axially moveable second end portion <b>680</b><i>b </i>is coupled to the track directly while an axially moveable first end portion <b>680</b><i>a </i>is coupled to the track indirectly (e.g., via the axially moveable first end portion <b>680</b><i>a</i>). The axially moveable first end portion <b>680</b><i>a </i>is an axially moveable end portion <b>680</b> that includes at least a portion of the chamber first end <b>214</b>. The axially moveable second end portion <b>680</b><i>b </i>is an axially moveable end portion <b>680</b> that includes at least a portion of the chamber second end <b>216</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0360" num="0368">The track may include a rail <b>710</b> between the axially moveable end portion <b>680</b> and the supporting sidewall <b>692</b>. The axially moveable end portion <b>680</b> may ride along the rail <b>710</b> as the axially moveable end portion <b>680</b> moves between the first and second positions.</p>
<p id="p-0361" num="0369">In some embodiments, the rail <b>710</b> is a telescoping rail, as exemplified. The telescoping rail may include at least a first rail body <b>712</b> and a second rail body <b>714</b>. The second rail body may be moveably secured to the first rail body <b>712</b> and moveable between a retracted position generally coextensive with the first rail body <b>712</b> and an extended position extending past an end of the first rail body <b>712</b>. The first rail body <b>712</b> may be secured to one of the axially moveable end portion <b>680</b> and the supporting sidewall <b>692</b>, while the second rail body <b>714</b> may be secured to the other of the axially moveable end portion <b>680</b> and the supporting sidewall <b>692</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0362" num="0370">Accordingly, it will be appreciated that the at least a portion of the second end portion <b>680</b><i>b </i>may move concurrently or sequentially (e.g., subsequent to) with the at least a portion of the first end portion <b>680</b><i>a</i>. The subsequent movement may be delayed by a predetermined time period. The predetermined time period may be, e.g., between 0.1 seconds and 10 seconds, between 0.1 seconds and 5 seconds, or between 0.1 seconds and 2 seconds. Additionally, or alternatively, the subsequent movement may be delayed by a predetermined change in the separation distance <b>684</b>. The predetermined change may be, e.g., between 0.1 times and 2 times the original separation distance, between 0.2 times and 1 time the original separation distance, or between 0.2 times and 0.5 times the original separation distance. A delay allows dirt in the air treatment chamber to decompress, and may loosen the dirt. For example, elongated dirt, such as hair, may decompress.</p>
<p id="p-0363" num="0371">Optionally, the at least a portion of the second end portion <b>680</b><i>b </i>is moved by opening the at least a portion of the first end portion <b>680</b><i>a</i>, but the separation distance <b>684</b> between the two is greater subsequent to the movement than prior to the movement. A greater separation distance provides further space for the dirt received therebetween to decompress.</p>
<p id="p-0364" num="0372">The axially moveable end portion <b>680</b> may be moved by any suitable driving member, including any discussed with moving the chamber first end <b>214</b> to the open position.</p>
<p id="p-0365" num="0373">The air treatment chamber <b>210</b> may be emptiable by opening the chamber first end <b>214</b> and moving at least a portion of the chamber second end <b>216</b> axially towards the chamber first end <b>214</b>.</p>
<heading id="h-0016" level="2">Moving Using Fluid Pressure</heading>
<p id="p-0366" num="0374">The following is a description of moving a portion a fluid driven moveable member of the surface cleaning apparatus (e.g., part or all of the first end <b>214</b> and or the second opposed end <b>216</b>) via fluid pressure, which may be used by itself or in combination with one or more of the rib arrester, the air inlet with a side opening, the variable area inlet downstream opening, the curved closure member, the axially moving closure member, the withdrawable closure member, the closure member moved by a driving member, the openable chamber first end, the axially moveable chamber end, positioning of the user interface, the filter removeable past the user interface, the radially-removeable post-motor filter, the nested filter, the porous air treatment outlet, the ultraviolet disinfection, and the dirt scoop, which are set out herein.</p>
<p id="p-0367" num="0375">In accordance with this aspect, as exemplified in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>57</b> and <b>58</b></figref>, a fluid driven moveable member <b>720</b> of the surface cleaning apparatus <b>100</b> is moveable via fluid pressure between a first position and a second position. It will be appreciated that the fluid pressure may be air pressure (i.e., suction) generated by an air moving member of the surface cleaning apparatus or a docking station or exhaust air from a suction motor.</p>
<p id="p-0368" num="0376">If a docking station is provided, then when the apparatus is docked, the fluid driven moveable member <b>720</b>, which is in the first position, may be received in the evacuation air flow path such that air flow through the evacuation air flow path will act on the fluid driven moveable member <b>720</b> when the fluid driven moveable member is in the first position to move the fluid driven moveable member <b>720</b> to a second or evacuation position. In other words, air flow through the evacuation air flow path may move the fluid driven member from the first position (i.e., towards the second position). Accordingly, the first position may be referred to as the operational, cleaning or use position. Such air flow may be produced by a suction motor in the surface cleaning apparatus, the docking station or both.</p>
<p id="p-0369" num="0377">Alternately or in addition, air flow through the apparatus air flow path when the surface cleaning apparatus is not docked may act on the fluid driven moveable member <b>720</b> to move the fluid driven member from the first position to the second.</p>
<p id="p-0370" num="0378">It will be appreciated that the fluid driven moveable member <b>720</b> may move (push or pull) part or all of the first end <b>214</b> and or the second opposed end <b>216</b> axially, such as along a rail <b>710</b> as discussed previously.</p>
<p id="p-0371" num="0379">An air impermeable member may be moved to enable air flow to move the fluid driven moveable member <b>720</b>. For example, a valve or other closure member may be provided to close part of the air flow path <b>160</b> such that air flow may move the fluid driven moveable member <b>720</b>. When it is desired to empty the dirt collection region <b>300</b>, the air impermeable member may be moved to an evacuation position, in which air flow may act on the fluid driven moveable member <b>720</b> to move the fluid driven moveable member <b>720</b> and therefore part or all of the first end <b>214</b> and or the second opposed end <b>216</b> may be moved. For example, the valve may be moved to close the vortex finder (e.g., it may be moved to close the outlet port at the downstream end of the vortex finder), e.g., by an actuator as discussed elsewhere herein or by air flow from the suction motor of the surface cleaning apparatus and/or the docking station drawing air in a reverse flow direction through the air treatment assembly thereby pushing or drawing the valve to close the port. When this occurs, the air flow path between the suction motor and the vortex finder may become sealed and form an evacuation air flow path and air flow may push the second opposed end <b>216</b>, and the first end <b>214</b> if linked thereto) axially forwardly to open the dirt collection region.</p>
<p id="p-0372" num="0380">To enable the apparatus air flow path to be active (i.e., the surface cleaning apparatus is to be used to clean a surface), the air impermeable member (e.g., valve) is moved, (e.g., by air flow or a biasing member or an electromechanical member or the like) to an operational position (e.g., the valve does not close the outlet port of the vortex finder). It will be appreciated that the valve may be moveable axially.</p>
<p id="p-0373" num="0381">It will be appreciated that the fluid driven moveable member <b>720</b> may include or consist of the chamber first end <b>214</b> and/or a moveable portion thereof and/or the chamber second end <b>216</b> or a moveable portion thereof and the ends may be linked for movement as discussed previously.</p>
<p id="p-0374" num="0382">Accordingly, the moveable portion of the chamber second end may move forwardly as dirt is sucked out of dirt collection region <b>300</b> when the surface cleaning apparatus <b>100</b> is docked with the docking station <b>390</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0375" num="0383">Optionally, the fluid driven moveable member <b>720</b> is biased to the evacuation (dirt emptying) position. Air pressure may move the fluid driven moveable member <b>720</b> to the operating (surface cleaning) position. When suction is terminated, then the fluid driven moveable member <b>720</b> moves to the evacuation position. Alternately, the fluid driven moveable member <b>720</b> may be biased to the operating position. Suction may move the fluid driven moveable member <b>720</b> to the evacuation position. When suction is terminated, then the fluid driven moveable member <b>720</b> moves to the operating position. Alternately, the fluid driven moveable member <b>720</b> is not biased to either position. Suction from the air moving member of the evacuation air flow path <b>392</b>, through the evacuation air flow path <b>392</b>, may move the fluid driven moveable member <b>720</b> to the evacuation position. Suction from the suction motor <b>322</b>, through the apparatus air flow path <b>160</b>, may move the fluid driven moveable member <b>720</b> to the operating position.</p>
<heading id="h-0017" level="2">Positioning of the User Interface</heading>
<p id="p-0376" num="0384">The following is a description of the positioning and mounting of the user interface <b>360</b> on the handle, which may be used by itself or in combination with one or more of the rib arrester, the air inlet with a side opening, the variable area inlet downstream opening, the curved closure member, the axially moving closure member, the withdrawable closure member, the closure member moved by a driving member, the openable chamber first end, the axially moveable chamber end, moving using fluid pressure, the filter removeable past the user interface, the radially-removeable post-motor filter, the nested filter, the porous air treatment outlet, the ultraviolet disinfection, and the dirt scoop, which are set out herein.</p>
