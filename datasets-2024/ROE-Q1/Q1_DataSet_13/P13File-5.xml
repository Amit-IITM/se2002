<heading id="h-0004" level="1">BACKGROUND</heading>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">Boxwood (<i>Buxus</i>) is a genus of about 70 species in the family Buxaceae. As slow-growing evergreen shrubs and small trees, they are planted worldwide, especially in landscapes and gardens. Boxwood blight is a destructive disease caused by <i>Calonectria pseudonaviculata </i>(Cps). In the United States, the disease was first observed and confirmed in North Carolina and Connecticut in 2011 and it has been reported in 30 states as of February 2021. English boxwood (<i>Buxus sempervirens &#x2018;Suffruticosa</i>&#x2019;), an iconic plant in American and European landscapes including many historic gardens and plantings, is highly susceptible to this disease. Currently, boxwood protection relies largely on repeated fungicide applications because there are essentially no cultivars that are immune to Cps and eradication of seriously diseased plants results in significant economic loss to the growers and owners. Furthermore, replacing English boxwood in the gardens of royal and historical estates with less susceptible varieties or cultivars is affected by the plants' market and historic values. Cps also attacks several <i>pachysandra</i>, sweet box, and potentially some common groundcovers and boxwood companion plants outside of the Buxaceae family.</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">While chemical control is effective, it is also expensive and potentially a threat to human health and to the environment. Specifically, chlorothalonil, one of the most effective compounds for controlling Cps, has recently been classified as a category one carcinogen and removed from the market in Europe. In addition, the use of fungicides in historic gardens and residential and commercial landscapes is particularly challenging. Economically viable and environmentally sound disease control methods are urgently needed.</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">Recent studies on mulching and biological control alternatives provided safer and more sustainable management of boxwood blight. Mulching over the infested soil and diseased leaf litter protect plants by effectively preventing pathogen inoculum from splashing onto healthy boxwood foliage. However, this method is powerless to avert transmission above the ground. Two recently identified Cps antagonists, <i>Trichoderma koningiopsis </i>from wild mushrooms and <i>Pseudomonas protegens </i>from plant nursery recycled irrigation water, have shown potential to be used to reduce disease by about 60%. However, ornamental plants at such protection levels are not marketable.</p>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">Plant diseases, including but not limited to boxwood blight, can wipe out entire crops and historical plantings in a short period of time. Globally, plant diseases pose an increasing risk to food security and plant biosecurity. The current approach to disease management depends mainly on chemical protection. This approach is not sustainable due to growing costs, fungicide resistance risk, and human and environmental safety concerns. Managing plant diseases in the environmental horticulture industry is particularly challenging as this industry produces a live commodity that requires the highest level of plant health for aesthetic value. More importantly, this commodity is expected to survive the stresses of shipment, retail, and being planted, then become established at its final destination. Contaminated plants at production facilities may appear healthy without any disease symptoms under intensive chemical protection programs. However, plants may become diseased when they reach their final destinations due to severe stress during shipment, sale, and field establishment, or from lack of continuing chemical protection. There is an urgent need to build a long-term disease-fighting mechanism into horticultural crop products to sustainably safeguard plants.</p>
<p id="p-0009" num="0008">Endophytes are the microorganisms that reside within the host plant's tissues in a commensal or beneficial manner. Endophytes have received considerable attention for their potential as ideal biocontrol agents because of their ability to suppress plant pathogens and to promote plant growth and yield. Many endophytes that also act as biocontrol agents for plant diseases are also plant growth promoters.</p>
<p id="p-0010" num="0009">Despite advancements in Cps control research, there is still a lack of biological control agents that are potent, effective, inexpensive, and safe for controlling boxwood blight and other plant diseases caused by bacteria, fungi, viruses, and oomycetes. It would be desirable if the agents were effective both as preventive measures and as post-exposure treatments, were non-pathogenic towards humans, and contributed to increased plant growth. It would further be desirable if the agents served as broad-spectrum biological control strains and additionally acted as a bio-sanitizer as well as a bio-fertilizer enhancing boxwood plant growth. These needs and other needs are satisfied by the present disclosure.</p>

<p id="p-0042" num="0041">Prior to describing the various aspects of the present disclosure, the following definitions are provided and should be used unless otherwise indicated. Additional terms may be defined elsewhere in the present disclosure.</p>
<heading id="h-0008" level="1">Definitions</heading>
<p id="p-0043" num="0042">As used herein, &#x201c;comprising&#x201d; is to be interpreted as specifying the presence of the stated features, integers, steps, or components as referred to, but does not preclude the presence or addition of one or more features, integers, steps, or components, or groups thereof. Moreover, each of the terms &#x201c;by&#x201d;, &#x201c;comprising,&#x201d; &#x201c;comprises&#x201d;, &#x201c;comprised of,&#x201d; &#x201c;including,&#x201d; &#x201c;includes,&#x201d; &#x201c;included,&#x201d; &#x201c;involving,&#x201d; &#x201c;involves,&#x201d; &#x201c;involved,&#x201d; and &#x201c;such as&#x201d; are used in their open, non-limiting sense and may be used interchangeably. Further, the term &#x201c;comprising&#x201d; is intended to include examples and aspects encompassed by the terms &#x201c;consisting essentially of&#x201d; and &#x201c;consisting of.&#x201d; Similarly, the term &#x201c;consisting essentially of&#x201d; is intended to include examples encompassed by the term &#x201c;consisting of.</p>
<p id="p-0044" num="0043">As used in the specification and the appended claims, the singular forms &#x201c;a,&#x201d; &#x201c;an&#x201d; and &#x201c;the&#x201d; include plural referents unless the context clearly dictates otherwise. Thus, for example, reference to &#x201c;a plant,&#x201d; &#x201c;a leaf,&#x201d; or &#x201c;an excipient,&#x201d; includes, but is not limited to, collections, mixtures, or combinations of two or more such plants, leaves, or excipients, and the like.</p>
<p id="p-0045" num="0044">It should be noted that ratios, concentrations, amounts, and other numerical data can be expressed herein in a range format. It will be further understood that the endpoints of each of the ranges are significant both in relation to the other endpoint, and independently of the other endpoint. It is also understood that there are a number of values disclosed herein, and that each value is also herein disclosed as &#x201c;about&#x201d; that particular value in addition to the value itself. For example, if the value &#x201c;10&#x201d; is disclosed, then &#x201c;about 10&#x201d; is also disclosed. Ranges can be expressed herein as from &#x201c;about&#x201d; one particular value, and/or to &#x201c;about&#x201d; another particular value. Similarly, when values are expressed as approximations, by use of the antecedent &#x201c;about,&#x201d; it will be understood that the particular value forms a further aspect. For example, if the value &#x201c;about 10&#x201d; is disclosed, then &#x201c;10&#x201d; is also disclosed.</p>
<p id="p-0046" num="0045">When a range is expressed, a further aspect includes from the one particular value and/or to the other particular value. For example, where the stated range includes one or both of the limits, ranges excluding either or both of those included limits are also included in the disclosure, e.g. the phrase &#x201c;x to y&#x201d; includes the range from &#x2018;x&#x2019; to &#x2018;y&#x2019; as well as the range greater than &#x2018;x&#x2019; and less than &#x2018;y&#x2019;. The range can also be expressed as an upper limit, e.g. &#x2018;about x, y, z, or less&#x2019; and should be interpreted to include the specific ranges of &#x2018;about x&#x2019;, &#x2018;about y&#x2019;, and &#x2018;about z&#x2019; as well as the ranges of &#x2018;less than x&#x2019;, less than y&#x2032;, and &#x2018;less than z&#x2019;. Likewise, the phrase &#x2018;about x, y, z, or greater&#x2019; should be interpreted to include the specific ranges of &#x2018;about x&#x2019;, &#x2018;about y&#x2019;, and &#x2018;about z&#x2019; as well as the ranges of &#x2018;greater than x&#x2019;, greater than y&#x2032;, and &#x2018;greater than z&#x2019;. In addition, the phrase &#x201c;about &#x2018;x&#x2019; to &#x2018;y&#x2019;&#x201d;, where &#x2018;x&#x2019; and &#x2018;y&#x2019; are numerical values, includes &#x201c;about &#x2018;x&#x2019; to about &#x2018;y&#x2019;&#x201d;.</p>
<p id="p-0047" num="0046">It is to be understood that such a range format is used for convenience and brevity, and thus, should be interpreted in a flexible manner to include not only the numerical values explicitly recited as the limits of the range, but also to include all the individual numerical values or sub-ranges encompassed within that range as if each numerical value and sub-range is explicitly recited. To illustrate, a numerical range of &#x201c;about 0.1% to 5%&#x201d; should be interpreted to include not only the explicitly recited values of about 0.1% to about 5%, but also include individual values (e.g., about 1%, about 2%, about 3%, and about 4%) and the sub-ranges (e.g., about 0.5% to about 1.1%; about 5% to about 2.4%; about 0.5% to about 3.2%, and about 0.5% to about 4.4%, and other possible sub-ranges) within the indicated range.</p>
<p id="p-0048" num="0047">As used herein, the terms &#x201c;about,&#x201d; &#x201c;approximate,&#x201d; &#x201c;at or about,&#x201d; and &#x201c;substantially&#x201d; mean that the amount or value in question can be the exact value or a value that provides equivalent results or effects as recited in the claims or taught herein. That is, it is understood that amounts, sizes, formulations, parameters, and other quantities and characteristics are not and need not be exact, but may be approximate and/or larger or smaller, as desired, reflecting tolerances, conversion factors, rounding off, measurement error and the like, and other factors known to those of skill in the art such that equivalent results or effects are obtained. In some circumstances, the value that provides equivalent results or effects cannot be reasonably determined. In such cases, it is generally understood, as used herein, that &#x201c;about&#x201d; and &#x201c;at or about&#x201d; mean the nominal value indicated &#xb1;10% variation unless otherwise indicated or inferred. In general, an amount, size, formulation, parameter or other quantity or characteristic is &#x201c;about,&#x201d; &#x201c;approximate,&#x201d; or &#x201c;at or about&#x201d; whether or not expressly stated to be such. It is understood that where &#x201c;about,&#x201d; &#x201c;approximate,&#x201d; or &#x201c;at or about&#x201d; is used before a quantitative value, the parameter also includes the specific quantitative value itself, unless specifically stated otherwise.</p>
<p id="p-0049" num="0048">As used herein, the term &#x201c;effective amount&#x201d; refers to an amount that is sufficient to achieve the desired modification of a physical property of the composition or material. For example, an &#x201c;effective amount&#x201d; of an active ingredient refers to an amount that is sufficient to achieve the desired improvement in the property modulated by the formulation component, e.g. achieving the desired level of pathogen and/or disease control. The specific level in terms of wt % in a composition required as an effective amount will depend upon a variety of factors including the amount and type of <i>Burkholderia </i>metabolites in the composition and/or presence of live cells, amount and type of any carriers or excipients, conditions surrounding the plants to be treated, length of time since treatment and/or number of treatments to be applied, degree of infestation, and identity of the pathogen to be treated.</p>
<p id="p-0050" num="0049">As used herein, the terms &#x201c;optional&#x201d; or &#x201c;optionally&#x201d; means that the subsequently described event or circumstance can or cannot occur, and that the description includes instances where said event or circumstance occurs and instances where it does not.</p>
<p id="p-0051" num="0050">&#x201c;Inoculum&#x201d; as used herein refers to a composition containing microorganisms, wherein the composition used to pretreat a plant for the purpose of establishing a population of the microorganisms on the plant. A successful inoculum can be at an active growth stage and size and will generally be free from contamination and may include additional components useful for establishing a population of microorganisms such as, for example, culture medium, solvents, buffers, and the like. In some aspects, a Cps fungal inoculum is prepared to infect plants in order to assess the efficacy of disclosed treatments. In other aspects, an SSG inoculum can be used to treat plants suffering from boxwood blight.</p>
<p id="p-0052" num="0051">&#x201c;Colony forming units&#x201d; (CFU) refers to an estimate of the number of viable microorganisms (e.g., bacteria or fungi) in a sample. In one aspect, number of CFU in a sample can be established by culturing the sample on a plate and counting microbial colonies, wherein each colony is assumed to have arisen from a single cell or group of cells.</p>
<p id="p-0053" num="0052">As used herein, &#x201c;conidium&#x201d; refers to an asexual, non-motile fungal spore. In one aspect, conidia are important reproductive features for Cps. In another aspect, application of the compositions and extracts disclosed herein can interfere with conidium formation and/or germination, or can cause lysis of Cps conidia.</p>
<p id="p-0054" num="0053">&#x201c;Microsclerotia&#x201d; as used herein are resting structures of a fungus such as, for example, Cps. A &#x201c;<i>sclerotium</i>&#x201d; is a had mass of fungal mycelium that contains some amount of nutritional reserve high in oils and low in moisture and that can survive environmental extremes; a &#x201c;microsclerotium&#x201d; is so defined based on relative size.</p>
<p id="p-0055" num="0054">&#x201c;Mycelium&#x201d; as used herein refers to a vegetative body of a fungus composed of branching fungal &#x201c;hyphae.&#x201d; The hyphae secrete enzymes that can break down biopolymers, the decomposition products of which are then absorbed by the mycelium and used as nutrients.</p>
<p id="p-0056" num="0055">&#x201c;Zoospores&#x201d; are asexual, motile propagules of oomycetes such as <i>Phytophthora </i>and <i>Pythium </i>species. A zoospore uses a flagellum for locomotion and can additionally be transmitted to uninfected plants by wind, water, and the like. &#x201c;Sporulation&#x201d; refers to the formation of spores from vegetative cells during adverse environmental conditions.</p>
<p id="p-0057" num="0056">&#x201c;Boxwood blight&#x201d; refers to a fungal disease of boxwood plants (i.e. <i>Buxus </i>species, varieties, and cultivars). Boxwood blight is caused by <i>Calonectria pseudonaviculata </i>(Cps), which is also sometimes called <i>Cylindrocladium buxicola. Buxus sempervirens </i>varieties may be more susceptible to boxwood blight but related species of <i>Pachysandra </i>and <i>Sarcococca </i>are also susceptible. Boxwood blight is initially found as spots or lesions on leaves, progressing to browning of leaves, which then fall off. Cps zoospores can remain viable for several years in fallen boxwood leaves and can be dispersed by wind, rain, contaminated clothing, animals, and the like. Disclosed herein are methods and compositions for treating and preventing boxwood blight and other diseases caused by plant pathogens.</p>
<p id="p-0058" num="0057">As used herein, &#x201c;cell suspension&#x201d; refers to compositions including un-lysed <i>Burkholderia cepacia </i>SSG cells, while &#x201c;cell free supernatant&#x201d; refers to solutions produced by centrifugation of an SSG culture suspension followed by filtration of the supernatant to remove any remaining cells.</p>
<p id="p-0059" num="0058">&#x201c;Genomovar&#x201d; as used herein refers to a <i>Burkholderia </i>strain that is phenotypically indistinguishable from related <i>Burkholderia </i>strains but that can be classified as a species based on DNA sequencing or other biochemical testing.</p>
<p id="p-0060" num="0059">&#x201c;Phytopathosystem&#x201d; refers to a combination of a plant and pathogen. In one aspect, a <i>Buxus sempervirens </i>plant infected with Cps is an example of a phytopathosystem.</p>
<p id="p-0061" num="0060">As used herein, the terms &#x201c;treating&#x201d; and &#x201c;treatment&#x201d; can refer generally to obtaining a desired physiological effect in a diseased plant. The effect can be, but does not necessarily have to be, prophylactic in terms of preventing or partially preventing a disease, symptom, or condition thereof. The effect can be therapeutic in terms of a partial or complete cure of a disease, condition, symptom or adverse effect attributed to the disease, disorder, or condition. The term &#x201c;treatment&#x201d; as used herein can include any treatment of a fungal, bacterial, and/or oomycete infection in a plant, and can include any one or more of the following: (a) preventing the disease from occurring in a plant which may have been exposed to an infected plant; (b) inhibiting the disease, i.e., arresting its development; and (c) relieving the disease, i.e., mitigating or ameliorating the disease and/or its symptoms or conditions. The term &#x201c;treatment&#x201d; as used herein can refer to both therapeutic treatment alone, prophylactic treatment alone, or both therapeutic and prophylactic treatment. Plants in need of treatment can include those already with the disorder and/or those in which the disorder is to be prevented. As used herein, the term &#x201c;treating&#x201d;, can include inhibiting the disease, disorder or condition, e.g., impeding its progress; and relieving the disease, disorder, or condition, e.g., causing regression of the disease, disorder, and/or condition. Treating the disease, disorder, or condition can include ameliorating at least one symptom of the particular disease, disorder, or condition, even if the underlying pathophysiology is not affected.</p>

<p id="p-0182" num="0183">In an experiment, individual detached leaves of <i>Buxus sempervirens </i>&#x2018;Justin Brouwers&#x2019; were inoculated with a drop of conidia suspensions of <i>Calonectria pseudonaviculata </i>(Cps) and water-soaked lesions appeared at two days post inoculation (dpi). While lesions on most of these leaves expanded by 7 dpi, a few disappeared (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b></figref>). SSG was isolated from the symptom reversed leaves. These leaves were surface sterilized with 70% ethanol, cut into small pieces, and vortexed in sterile deionized water (SDW) for 10 min. The supernatant was plated on potato dextrose agar (PDA, Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, Mo., USA) after brief precipitation by gravity and grown for 48 h at 25&#xb0; C. To isolate SSG, colonies on the plates were grouped and subjected to selection by dual culture assay against Cps.</p>
<p id="p-0183" num="0184">SSG was grown in 4 mL nutrient broth (Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, Mo., USA) at 28&#xb0; C. for 24 h as a stock culture for long-term storage at &#x2212;80&#xb0; C., for short-term storage at 4&#xb0; C., as streak culture on nutrient agar, and other uses. For fresh stock culture preparation, a single colony was taken from the plate and grown in PD broth or nutrient broth overnight at 28&#xb0; C. To make a large amount of culture, 1 mL of the stock culture was grown in 150 mL for 40 h. The culture was centrifuged at 14210&#xd7;g for 15 min to suspend the pellet for preparation of cell suspensions and to pass the supernatant through a 0.22 &#x3bc;m-filter for preparation of cell-free supernatant (CFS).</p>

<p id="p-0184" num="0185">A Cps isolate, Sb1, from sweet box (<i>Sarcococca hookeriana </i>var. <i>humilis</i>) was used. The isolate was grown at 25&#xb0; C. and maintained at 20&#xb0; C. on PDA as described previously. The conidia for plant inoculation was produced using a liquid culture in PD broth which produced a high concentration of inocula as described in the literature. Conidia were suspended in 0.01% polysorbate 20, and the concentration of conidial suspensions was determined with a hemocytometer.</p>
<heading id="h-0018" level="2">Dual Culture Assays on Antagonism of the Isolates</heading>
<p id="p-0185" num="0186">Dual-culture assays were conducted in 90-mm PDA plates.

<p id="p-0189" num="0189"><i>Buxus sempervirens </i>&#x2018;Justin Brouwers&#x2019; in 1 gallon (7 inch) pots was used in the study. Plants were kept in the field plot at the Virginia Tech Hampton Roads Agricultural Research and Extension Center (HRAREC), watered, and fertilized regularly before the experiment. Since Cps is a high alert plant pathogen in the USA, plants were transferred at the time of experiments to the laboratory, watered regularly or as needed, and tested at 23&#xb0; C. with a 9 h light/15 h dark cycle.</p>
<p id="p-0190" num="0000">Plant Treatments with SSG</p>
<p id="p-0191" num="0190">Treatments included SSG CFS, the suspension of the cell pellet in 200 mL 0.01% polysorbate 20, its dilutions, and the control, 0.01% polysorbate 20 or nutrient broth. A 10-fold serial dilution was made from the cell suspension with 0.01% polysorbate 20. The concentration of the suspension was determined using the suspensions of 7th and 8th dilutions that were plated onto PDA for cfu/mL. Treatments also included treatment time and intervals before and after the challenge of plants with Cps inoculum. Plant treatment before Cps inoculation included a lead time of 2, 10, 20, and 30 days while that after Cps inoculation included a post time of 3, 24, and 48 h.</p>
<p id="p-0192" num="0191">At treatment, plants in each of three pots in a large plastic container (22&#xd7;13&#xd7;17.5 in) before or after Cps inoculation, were sprayed with 20 mL of the tester.

<p id="p-0193" num="0000">Plant Inoculation with Cps and Disease Assessment</p>
<p id="p-0194" num="0192">Plants before and after treatment were inoculated with a Cps conidial suspension at 1-4&#xd7;10<sup>4 </sup>conidia/mL. Plants in each pot were sprayed with 20 to 50 mL inoculum depending on the Cps concentration used. Plants after inoculation were kept in the containers with covers for 48 h to promote plant infection and then without covers for additional 5 days for disease development. The number of infected leaves in each pot were counted to calculate disease incidence. The efficacy of each treatment for control of boxwood blight was computed by dividing the difference in disease incidence between the control and the treatment by the control disease incidence.</p>
<p id="p-0195" num="0000">Effects of SSG on Cps Sporulation from Leaf Litters</p>
<p id="p-0196" num="0193">Six boxwood plant pots were placed into upside-down empty pots in the containers to prevent cross contamination during the experiment and plants were watered 24 h before treatment. Diseased leaf litters were harvested from diseased plants 3 weeks after inoculation with Cps conidia at 5&#xd7;10<sup>4</sup>/mL and stored at 4&#xb0; C. for over 30 days after drying. Each container was sprinkled with about 100 leaves. Half of the pots were sprayed with 70 mL 50% culture (about 10<sup>7-8 </sup>cfu/mL) onto the litter under the plants, and another half of the ports were sprayed with the same amount of 50% of the same media used for the culture as control. The containers were watered overhead every other day until the end of the experiment to allow inoculation by splash to plants after covered with lids for 24 h after treatment. Ten of the treated leaves were sampled from each pot at 5, 10, 20, 30, 40, and 50 days post-treatment (dpt) and placed in a moist crisper for 4 days for Cps sporulation. To quantify sporulation, the leaves were suspended in 10 mL 0.01% polysorbate 20 by vortexing for 10 min and the suspension was loaded onto a hemocytometer for conidia count under a microscope. Each experiment containing 6 replicate pots was conducted three times.</p>

<p id="p-0201" num="0196">Taxonomy of SSG Isolates</p>
<p id="p-0202" num="0197">DNA extracted from SSG cells was used for taxonomy by sequencing and restriction fragment length polymorphism (RFLP). For16S rRNA gene PCR and sequencing, universal primers 27F, 968F, and 1410R were used. For RecA gene PCR and sequencing, BCRI and 2 primers were used. Sequences were blasted against known sequences of microbes to match to a species level.</p>
<p id="p-0203" num="0198">In addition to sequencing, SSG PCR products of RecA were subjected to HaeIII and Mn/I-based RFLP analysis to place SSG to a genomovar of <i>Burkholderia cepacia </i>complex (Bcc).

<heading id="h-0022" level="1">Example 2: Results and Discussion for Assessment of Control of Boxwood Blight</heading>
<heading id="h-0023" level="2">SSG Inhibits Cps Growth, Conidium Morphogenesis, and Microsclerotium Germination</heading>
<p id="p-0206" num="0201">SSG was selected among eight bacterial isolates from symptom-reversed leaf area of boxwood after inoculation with Cps because of its superior antagonism presented in the dual culture assay. Mycelial growth of plugs in the center of plates were not (or were, but only to some extent) suppressed by other isolates during the assay. In contrast, mycelial growth was suppressed by SSG from beginning of the assay and did not change through the end of the assay.</p>
<p id="p-0207" num="0202">The time course study showed that both the cells and cell free supernatant (CFS) of SSG affected conidium morphogenesis. Conidia in the SSG cell suspension did not germinate at any time point, and more and more of them lysed with increasing exposure time. None were present at 24 h after the treatment.</p>
<p id="p-0208" num="0203">Similarly, those in CFS had a significantly lower germination rate than the control (P &#x3c;0.0001) indicating lysis of conidia. However, there were half empty conidia which were not apparent in the cell treatment. Furthermore, very few germlings of CFS treatment developed and formed hypha. In contrast, germination rate of control was high at the first hour and climbed with increase of incubation time and formed hypha and mycelia.</p>
<p id="p-0209" num="0204">Both CFS and SSG also suppressed the survival of Cps rnicrosclerotia from leaf litters. Isolated rnicrosclerotia did not form colonies at 4 h after incubation in SSG cell suspension and in CFS for 8 h. In contrast, they formed colonies in control under the same conditions. In media broth, the control had massive mycelia growth at 2 weeks after the treatment while CFS and cells treatments grew nothing although those in CFS survived longer.</p>
<heading id="h-0024" level="2">SSG Reduced Disease Incidence of Boxwood Blight</heading>
<p id="p-0210" num="0205">With reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref>, SSG also reduced disease incidence of boxwood blight. Compared to the controls, plants treated with cell suspension in 0.01% polysorbate 20 at &#x3e;10<sup>8 </sup>cfu/mL and CFS received 99.6% and 66.9% protection against blight 100, respectively, when inoculated with conidia. Protection by cell suspension decreased with decreasing number of cells. It reduced to 85.7% at 10<sup>7 </sup>cfu/mL, although protection was not significantly different from the higher concentration. There was significant reduction of protection when the cell concentrations were reduced between 10<sup>3-6 </sup>cfu/mL and plants received 35 to 40% protection. However, plants had little protection when cells were further diluted.</p>
<p id="p-0211" num="0206">Lead time for treatment before the inoculation also affected the plant protection efficacy. Efficacy did not change significantly between lead time 2 days and 10 days. Efficacy was reduced when lead time was 20 days or longer. However, plants received more than 50% protection, indicating the persistence of antagonism of SSG.</p>
<p id="p-0212" num="0207">Treatment after Cps inoculation was less effective compared to pretreatment. However, infection was suppressed if inoculated plants were treated early. Results varied compared to using cell suspension of CFS (Table 1). Infection was reduced by 99%, 81%, and 61% when inoculated plants were sprayed with SSG cells at &#x3e;10<sup>8 </sup>cfu/ml at 3, 24, and 48 h after inoculation. There was decrease of efficacy with progression of infection. However, when CFS was used, 99.2% of plants were protected from infection at 48 h after inoculation.</p>

SSG Reduced Cps Sporulation and Protected Plants from Leaf Litters
</p>
<p id="p-0214" num="0208">Cps sporulation on leaf litters after sprayed with SSG culture was significantly reduced compared to the control. The reduction, about 40,000 conidia/cm<sup>2 </sup>was consistent at each sampling time despite of nature reduction. Conidium production of SSG treatment was almost controlled at 30 or longer exposure. While many conidia were observed for the control, there were very few conidia at the last sampling time (50 dpt). Meanwhile, SSG colonies were recovered from the sample soil indicating survival of SSG in soil. The density of cells in the soil was about 18,500 (&#xb1;42) cfu/g.</p>
<p id="p-0215" num="0209">SSG also affected plant infection through leaflitters and plant growth. Plants in the pots with treated leaf litters by SSG culture had significantly lower disease incidence (1.2%) than the control (11.4%) 50 dpt after the treatment (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b>A</figref>). With reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b>B</figref>, disease <b>110</b> occurred mainly on the bottom of the leaves, indicating that the inoculum originated from the litters. Furthermore, SSG pots had significantly more leaves compared to the control pots, indicating plant growth during the treatment.</p>
<heading id="h-0025" level="2">Identification of SSG</heading>
<p id="p-0216" num="0210">DNA of SSG was sequenced for 16S rRNA gene. The sequence of SSG matched at 99% identity with many of those know species in the <i>Burkholderia cepacia </i>complex (Bcc). To confirm that SSG was a member of Bcc, SSG was grown on Bcc selective media (BCSA) at 25, 37, and 42&#xb0; C. Sage colonies appeared in the plates at 25 and 37&#xb0; C. and the media color turned to yellow after 48 h, indicating SSG as a typical Bcc bacteria. To further classify SSG, DNA of SSG was amplified for RecA gene and digested with HeaIII and MnII restriction enzymes. However, RFLPs showed inconsistent patterns between genomovars I and III. The sequence of the RecA gene of SSG placed SSG in different subtrees despite that it matched several known species in Bcc and had the best match to <i>B. cepacia </i>strains. SSG was negative for <i>B. cepacia </i>epidemic strain marker (BCESM) when the DNA was further analyzed. These results indicated that taxonomy of SSG in Bcc was not clear but differed from clinical strains.</p>
<heading id="h-0026" level="1">Discussion</heading>
<p id="p-0217" num="0211">This study identified SSG as a potential biofungicide of boxwood blight from boxwood endophyte isolates. SSG provided strong protection against boxwood blight when the cells at higher than one million cfu/mL and cell free supernatant (CFS) of cultures were used to pretreat the plant 10 days before inoculation of the pathogen Cps. The efficacy is superlative compared to those previously reported non-indigenous fungal <i>Trichoderma koningiopsis </i>and bacterial <i>Pseudomonas protegens</i>, and its control efficacy is comparable to that of currently used fungicides. SSG is also very effective in controlling infection at the early stage after the inoculation. Symptoms from Cps infection on susceptible English Boxwood can appear as early as two days after inoculation following penetration and colonization on at 5 and 12 h. 99% of plants were prevented from symptom production when treated with SSG cells at &#x3e;10<sup>8 </sup>cfu/mL 3 h after inoculation and CFS of SSG 48 h after inoculation with Cps, suggesting that SSG may be used to terminate the infection process and stop the penetration of the pathogen. Furthermore, SSG gradually degraded Cps in leaf debris. Since SSG can survive in the soil at least 50 days as indicated by sampling at the end of the experiment, it may be used as a sustainable biosanitizer for pathogen inocula in/on the soil and diseased leaf litters. Plant disease biocontrol plays an important role in Integrated Pest Management (IPM) systems in reducing dependence on chemical inputs. With a high efficacy in boxwood blight control and plant protection, SSG as one of few plant Burkholderial endophytes reported, has great potential to fulfill the task and beyond.</p>
<p id="p-0218" num="0212">Boxwood protection by SSG may be derived from direct and indirect antagonisms involving complex modes of action. Direct antagonisms is demonstrated by conidium lysis and no germination of microsclerotia in SSG cells. The bacterial metabolites greatly contributed to the killing and suppression. First, diffusion of SSG suppressed mycelium growth of Cps. Second, conidia had poor survival and germination and abnormal differentiation, and microsclerotia decreased survival after incubation with CFS. Similarly, CFS suppressed early plant infection and reduces disease incidence. However, SSG volatiles are unlikely involved because no suppression was observed when dual cultures of SSG and Cps were placed in the divided plates. Direct antagonism of SSG may be attributed to production of antibiotics commonly found in Bcc species such as pyrrolnitrin, occidiofungins, and cepafungins (glidobactins).</p>
<p id="p-0219" num="0213">Bcc species produce pyrrolnitrin optimally late in the growth phase and accumulated a main portion in their cells. The fact that CFS rescued plants from infection by Cps at 48 h after inoculation while SSG cells only did for the infection at 3 h but not later also support involvement of antibiotics appears linked to presence and amount of pyrrolnitrin. However, whether and how these antibiotics and if there novel antibiotics or metabolites involve direct antagonisms of SSG to Cps remained to be further investigated. In addition to metabolites, SSG cells may also contributed the direct antagonism of SSG. In the in vitro experiments, conidia lysed in the SSG cell suspension were significantly more than those in CFS, suggesting that SSG cells may out-compete or kill Cps during germination and penetration. Further investigation of direct interaction between bacterial cells and Cps using lockout of antibiotic gene SSG or drugs blocking the release of antibiotics is warranted to confirm this mode of action of SSG.</p>
<p id="p-0220" num="0214">Indirect antagonism by SSG is shown by the presence of constant medium levels of protection from treatments at extended lead time longer than two days and cell concentrations at 1,000 cfu/mL or higher. Bcc bacteria contain complex QS systems for the regulation of the production of a variety of extracellular products including siderophores and antibiotics and for plant colonization and growth. Although it is not clear how SSG interacts with plant, same level of protection resulted from different concentrations or survival status of cells does not look like a consequence of antibiotics alone but more like a consequence of plant defense elicited by threshold signals of SSG at treatment. Another implication of the involvement of indirect antagonism is from the fact that SSG was one of the endophytes from the leaf area of symptom reversion after Cps inoculation. However, it is not clear what role SSG played in the healing process. Bacterial endophytes including <i>Burkholderia </i>have many traits contributing to indirect antagonisms. They produce growth regulators and other chemicals to promote plant defense and growth. <i>Burkholderia </i>produce siderophores, giving a competitive advantage at scavenging for iron. They also produce 1-arninocyclopropane-1-carboxylate (ACC) deaminase, fix nitrogen, and solubilize phosphate for plant growth promotion.</p>
<p id="p-0221" num="0215">SSG as a highly effective <i>Burkholderia </i>antagonistic endophyte for Cps and possesses great potential in controlling boxwood blight. However, like other bacterial biocontrol agents and fungicides, SSG does not work at its best for more than 10 days for pretreatment. This may be due to decrease of survival of SSG on plant surface or limited entry into plant tissue as suggested by reduction of efficacy with increased treatment lead time.</p>
<p id="p-0222" num="0216"><i>Burkholderia </i>has been recovered from various environments. In this study, SSG was isolated from plant tissue and survived in soil for at least 50 days. It is likely that light and moisture conditions may be the major factors associating SSG survival on leaf surface and in soil and plant tissue. Another issue that may be encountered in the application of SSG is its safety. SSG belongs to Bcc and is very similar to <i>B. cepacia </i>in sequence in genomovar I although it is phylogenetically different from any of the known strains in the genomovar that are dominant with environmental strains. More importantly, SSG was originated from a plant and is negative for the human virulent BCESM marker, confirming its difference from clinical strains associated with cystic fibrosis patients.</p>

<p id="p-0223" num="0217">Plant bacterial, fungal, and oomycete pathogens including <i>Fusarium solani </i>(11B07), <i>Volutella buxi, Phytophthora capsici </i>(22H3), P. cinnamormi (30D6), <i>P. infestans </i>(27E7), <i>P. nicotianae </i>(11311), <i>P. ramorum </i>(32G2), <i>P. sojae </i>(28G4), <i>E. coli </i>(DH52)(60622), <i>Erwinia carotovora </i>(60627), Psuedomonas <i>syringae </i>(60625), <i>Ralstonia solanacearum </i>(60622), <i>Stenotrophomonas maltophilia </i>(PE1-sy), and <i>Xanthomonas </i>campastris (60627) were used in this study. Strain/isolate cultures of fungi, <i>Phytophthora</i>, and bacteria were plated out from long term storage and grown on PDA, V8 agar, and nutrient agar plates, respectively at 25&#xb0; C. before tests were performed.</p>
<heading id="h-0029" level="2">Dual Cultural Assays</heading>
<p id="p-0224" num="0218">Streak and disk methods described in the manuscript were used for tests of culture growth of bacterial and fungal/<i>Phytophthora </i>pathogens, respectively in this study. Each test included three replicate plates and was repeated at least once.</p>
<p id="p-0225" num="0219">Similar methods used for conidia of Cps described in Example 1 were used for investigating the effects of SSG on the survival and germination of zoospores. Zoospore were produced using a plug and wet plate method described previously. Specifically, 1004 zoospore suspension at 10<sup>5</sup>/mL was added into 2 mL PDB (CK), CFS from 40 h-culture in PDB, or suspension of SSG cells in PDB and incubated at 23&#xb0; C. Zoospore behavior was observed under a microscope after 24 h.</p>

Plants except for <i>rhododendron </i>were 1-gallon plant gifts from Sunder's Brothers and were seeded in a greenhouse under mist.

<heading id="h-0031" level="2">Plant Protection Against Diseases</heading>
<p id="p-0227" num="0221">Five phytopathosystems with plants and <i>Phytophthora </i>spp described above were investigated. Both treatment and inoculation were conducted in the large containers described in Example 1 in the laboratory. Plants were pretreated 48 h with the diluted cell culture or resuspended and diluted cell culture with 0.01% polysorbate 20 before inoculation. Controls were the same solution (nutrient broth, or 0.01% polysorbate 20) without the bacterial culture. Plants were kept in the containers with lids to keep moisture for 24 h after treatment with 30 mL for plants in the 4 inch pots and 50 mL for plants in the 1-gallon pots at 10<sup>7-8 </sup>cfu/mL. Inoculation with zoospores was conducted after the lids had been removed for 24 h. Inoculum concentrations ranged from 1.3&#xd7;10<sup>3</sup>/mL to 2&#xd7;10<sup>4</sup>/mL, and 25 mL or 75 mL was sprayed on plants in each 4 inch and 1-gallon pot, respectively. Inoculated plants were kept in containers with lids for 24 h and without lids for 1 week for infection development. Total leaves, infected leaves, or lesion number on leaves was recorded to determine the disease incidence. Each treatment in the experiment for a phytopathosystem included three replicate plant pots. Experiments were repeated twice for annual <i>vinca, P. nicotianae</i>, and <i>rhododendron </i>with <i>P. ramorum</i>, once for pepper or cucumber with <i>P. capsici</i>, and none for tomato with <i>P. infestans. </i></p>

<heading id="h-0033" level="2">Effects of SSG on Culture Growth of Varieties of Plant Pathogens</heading>
<p id="p-0228" num="0222">SSG was tested for suppression of cell and mycelium growth on isolates/strains of 14 bacteria, fungal and <i>Phytophthora </i>species. In the 6 bacterial strains tested, significant inhibition was observed on four, including Psuedomonas <i>syringae, Stenotrophomonas maltophilia, Xanthomonas campestris</i>, and <i>E. coli</i>. Among them, <i>Xanthomonas </i>campastris was most vulnerable, with a suppression zone nearly 3 cm in diameter. However, there was no suppression on <i>Erwinia carotovora</i>, and suppression on <i>Ralstonia solanacearum </i>was not significant, suggesting the antagonistic spectrum of SSG on bacteria is limited.</p>
<p id="p-0229" num="0223">SSG inhibited the growth of all test fungi and <i>Phytophthora</i>. Among <i>Phytophthora</i>, the growth of P. irifestans, <i>P. ramorum</i>, and <i>P. sojae </i>were totally suppressed, although <i>P. capsici, P. cinnamomi</i>, and <i>P. nicotianae </i>were not. This difference may result from growth speed of the species on V8 agar. The former three species grew slow so that they may be caught up by diffusion of SSG strips while the latter three grew fast, and the first grown mycelia were not affected.</p>
<p id="p-0230" num="0224">Suppression on <i>Phytophthora </i>by metabolites from SSG was also shown with zoospores. Zoospores in PDB germinated and developed mycelia after 24 h incubation. In contrast, most zoospores in CFS disappeared or lysed. However, those in SSG cell suspension in PDB appeared less affected. One third of them also germinated, although the germlings were weak and the hyphal development was poor. This suggests that SSG metabolites are responsible for zoospore degradation and germination suppression and are effective at a certain concentration that the cells did not achieve because of resuspension.</p>
<heading id="h-0034" level="2">Effects of SSG on <i>Phytophthora </i>Diseases</heading>
<p id="p-0231" num="0225">Plants of annual <i>vinca</i>, cucumber, pepper, <i>rhododendron</i>, and tomatoes were tested against <i>P. nicotianae, P. capsici, P. ramorum</i>, and <i>P. infestans</i>, respectively, after being treated with SSG (see <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>6</b>A-<b>6</b>D</figref>). With reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>6</b>A</figref>, annual <i>vinca </i>received excellent protection against <i>P. nicotianae </i>as evidenced by increased number of/larger flowers 130. Shoot and leaf infection was reduced by 98% and 96%, respectively when cell culture of SSG was used. The reduction was 97 and 91%, respectively, with the resuspended cells and 85% and 71% with CFS. These results indicate that using cells or CFS alone reduced disease severity and using both cells and metabolites of SSG gave the best protection of plants. The latter may involve direct and indirect antagonism.</p>
<p id="p-0232" num="0226">Efficacy of plant protection against the pathogen by SSG was also significant in rhododendron-<i>P. ramorum </i>system. With reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>6</b>B</figref>, resuspended SSG cells allowed 60% reduction of leaf infection 140 and 80% reduction of lesions. Efficacy of SSG decreased with extended treatment lead time. However, reduction rates of pretreatments of 1 and 2 weeks were same (40%), indicating the presence of induced resistance. It is not clear whether the efficacy may improve with SSG culture.</p>
<p id="p-0233" num="0227">Plant protection in cucumber/pepper-<i>P. capsici </i>by SSG was not as good as in the above phytopathosysterns although SSG culture was not also used in those experiments. Between CFS and suspended cells, better results were obtained with the latter. They reduced plant infection of pepper and cucumber by 55% and 33%, respectively, compared with CFS that reduced the infection by 27% and 17%. No protection was shown for tomato against <i>P. infestans</i>. The lower efficacy of SSG on these systems likely results from the susceptibility of test plants to SSG. Various levels of plant toxicity was observed on the test plants treated with CFS and cells alone which appeared associated with the tenderness and hairy status of plant. The more tender the plants, the less protection. The hairy cucumber and tomato plants had little protection.</p>

<p id="p-0234" num="0228">Cps isolate Sb1 (12A01) was used in this study. This isolate, although recovered from affected sweet box (<i>Sarcococca hookeriana </i>var. <i>humilis</i>), was part of the same clone introduced to a private garden via infected English boxwood and has the same virulence as those from boxwood on the same garden as shown in a comparative study. Cultures were grown and maintained at 25&#xb0; C. on Difco&#x2122; potato dextrose agar (PDA, Becton, Dickinson and Company, Sparks, Md., USA). Conidia were produced using fresh potato dextrose broth (PDB). Briefly, a small amount of mycelia was scraped from the culture surface then evenly distributed in 90 mm plates with fresh PDB. After a 4 day incubation at 25&#xb0; C., the nutrient medium was decanted. Mycelial mats that formed and were attached to the plate bottom were rinsed with sterilized distilled water (SDW). These washed plates were then placed under fluorescent light at 1200 lux to induce the production of conidia. Conidia were harvested with SDW or 0.01% polysorbate 20 (Croda Inc., New York, N.Y., USA) into a beaker; spore concentration was determined with a hemocytometer.</p>

Plants were irrigated up to three times a day, depending upon the time of year, and maintained on a gravel pad until use at the Virginia Tech Hampton Roads Agricultural Research and Extension Center in Virginia Beach, Va., USA.</p>
<p id="p-0236" num="0230">To prevent Cps from spreading to nearby boxwood plantings, all inoculation studies were done in a laboratory with restricted access. During each experiment, plants were placed in Ultra&#x2122; Latching Storage Boxes (66 cm&#xd7;41 cm&#xd7;50 cm, Sterilite Corporation, Townsend, Mass., USA) to further contain the diseased plant materials. At the termination of experiments, all used plants and planting materials were autoclaved before disposal, while used boxes and other tools are washed and decontaminated with 70% ethanol.</p>

<p id="p-0239" num="0232">The leaves showing symptom reversion were surface sterilized again with 70% ethanol, cut into small pieces, then vortexed in SDW for 10 min. When the leaf debris settled to the bottom, 100 &#x3bc;L of the supernatant was plated onto PDA then incubated at 25&#xb0; C. for 48 h. Resultant bacterial colonies were grouped by color and size; eight representative colonies were subcultured on Difco nutrient agar (NA, Becton, Dickinson and Company, Sparks, Md., USA) for initial evaluation using a dual culture assay. Briefly, a mycelial plug of Cps was placed in the center of 90 mm PDA plates and a bacterial isolate from a 24 h liquid culture in Difco nutrient broth (NB, Becton, Dickinson and Company, Sparks, Md., USA) was streaked equidistantly on its left and right sides. Control plates were streaked with NB without the small sage green (SSG). The assay was done three times with slightly different timings of Cps seeding in relation to bacterial streaking: 3 days before in the first run, at the same time in the second run, and 16 h later in the third run. Each run included three replicate plates per bacterial isolate. All plates were incubated at 25&#xb0; C. in the dark. The diameter of the Cps colony in each plate was measured 4 weeks later. The bacterial isolate that produced small sage green (SSG) colonies on PDA was consistently most effective against Cps growth (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>14</b></figref>); subsequently, it was selected for further evaluation.</p>

A 100 &#x3bc;L aliquot of Cps suspension at 10<sup>4 </sup>conidia/mL SDW was mixed with 700 &#x3bc;L of Cell, CFS, or PDB in Costar&#x2122; 24 well Flat Bottom Cell Culture Plates (Corning Inc., Corning, N.Y., USA). The mixtures were incubated at 25&#xb0; C. in the dark for 1, 4, 8, 24, or 48 h then examined for conidia lysis, germination, and germling differentiation using an Olympus IX71 inverted microscope (Olympus Corporation of the Americas Headquarters, Center Valley, Pa., USA) at magnification of 100&#xd7;. This assay included triplicate wells per treatment and was done twice.</p>
<heading id="h-0040" level="2">Effect of SSG on Boxwood Blight</heading>
<p id="p-0242" num="0235">Four treatments were included in this study: (1) Cell at 10<sup>8 </sup>cfu/mL 0.01% polysorbate 20, (2) CFS, (3) 0.01% polysorbate 20 (as the control for the Cell treatment), and (4) NB (as the control for CFS). Boxwood foliage was pretreated at 20 mL/plant using hand sprayers one day prior to being challenged with Cps. This experiment had triplicate plants per treatment and was done three times. Treated plants were arranged in a randomized complete block design in the storage boxes for inoculation with Cps at 1 to 5&#xd7;10<sup>4 </sup>conidia/mL 0.01% polysorbate 20 at 20 mL/pot. Inoculated plants were kept in closed storage boxes for 48 h to facilitate infection. Diseased leaves and healthy-looking leaves on each plant were counted 7 days post inoculation. Disease incidence was calculated by dividing the diseased leaf count by the total leaf count.</p>
<heading id="h-0041" level="2">Effect of SSG Concentration on Boxwood Blight</heading>
<p id="p-0243" num="0236">Five concentrations of 0, 10<sup>3</sup>, 10<sup>5</sup>, 10<sup>7 </sup>and 10<sup>9 </sup>cfu/mL 0.01% polysorbate 20 were included in the initial run. Based on the results from the initial run, the concentration of 10<sup>3 </sup>cfu/mL was excluded from the second run. Plant pretreatment including the lead time of one day, Cps inoculation, and disease assessment all were performed as described above with two minor changes. Cps inoculum concentration was at 5&#xd7;10<sup>4 </sup>and 2&#xd7;10<sup>4 </sup>conidia/mL in the initial and repeated runs, respectively. Likewise, the highest SSG cell concentration was slightly greater in the first than the second runs (3&#xd7;10<sup>9 </sup>vs. 2&#xd7;10<sup>9 </sup>cfu/mL).</p>
<heading id="h-0042" level="2">Effect of SSG Treatment Lead Time on Boxwood Blight</heading>
<p id="p-0244" num="0237">All boxwood plants were treated with SSG at 4&#xd7;10<sup>8 </sup>cfu/mL or 0.01% polysorbate 20 as control. A quarter of the plants pretreated with SSG and those with polysorbate 20 were inoculated with Cps at 2&#xd7;10<sup>4 </sup>conidia/mL 1, 10, 20, and 30 days later. SSG pretreatment, Cps inoculation, and disease assessment were all performed as described above for the SSG concentration experiment. Blight control was calculated for each lead time by dividing the difference in disease incidence between SSG treated and control plants by that of the control plants. This experiment was repeated once with SSG at 2&#xd7;10<sup>9 </sup>cells/mL and Cps at 10<sup>4 </sup>conidia/mL.</p>
<heading id="h-0043" level="2">Effect of Post-Inoculation SSG Treatment on Boxwood Blight</heading>
<p id="p-0245" num="0238">This study included the application of resuspended SSG cells at three-time points: 3, 24, and 48 h post inoculation, plus a nontreated control. Cps inoculation, SSG treatment, disease assessment, and blight control calculations were done as described above for the lead-time experiment. The experiment was conducted twice with SSG at 5&#xd7;10<sup>8 </sup>cfu/mL and 4&#xd7;10<sup>8 </sup>cfu/mL while Cps was at 5&#xd7;10<sup>4 </sup>conidia/mL and 2&#xd7;10<sup>4 </sup>conidia/mL in the first and second runs, respectively.</p>
<heading id="h-0044" level="2">SSG Effect on Potential of Diseased Leaves as a Source of Inoculum</heading>
<p id="p-0246" num="0239">This study began with collecting and air-drying diseased leaves then storing them in a cold room at 4&#xb0; C. for 15 months. One hundred stored leaves were spread on the surface of the potting mix under healthy Justin Brouwers plants in a container, then immediately cover sprayed (not onto the boxwood foliage) with a mixture of 35 mL NB culture of SSG and 35 mL SDW at a final concentration of 10<sup>8 </sup>cfu/mL or 1 strength NB without SSG. Each treatment included three replicate plant containers and treatments were arranged in a randomized complete block design. After 24 h, plants in treated containers were overhead watered using a watering can, which was repeated every other day until the end of the experiment. To prevent cross contamination between treatments through movement of accumulated water at the bottom of boxes, plant containers were placed on inverted empty containers. Three sets of data were collected with Cps sporulation on leaf litter and blight incidence on boxwood foliage assessed six times while SSG survival in the potting mix was determined twice post-treatment. This experiment was conducted twice.</p>
<p id="p-0247" num="0240">Cps ability to sporulate on control and SSG-treated leaf litter was assessed at 5, 10, 20, 30, 40, and 50 days post-treatment. On each assessment day, ten leaves were collected from each pot and placed onto mesh overlaid moist paper towels in closed plastic crispers for 5 days. These leaves were placed in a test tube with 10 mL 0.01% polysorbate 20 then vortexed for 10 min to dislodge conidia. Concentrations of conidia in resultant suspension were determined with a hemocytometer, and six independent counts were averaged for each replicate sample. The per ml conidia concentration was equivalent to the number of conidia produced per leaf. This number was then divided by Justin Brouwers average leaf size of 2 cm<sup>2 </sup>to calculate the number of conidia produced per unit leaf area.</p>
<p id="p-0248" num="0241">Blighted leaves including those fallen ones were counted for each plant. The total number of leaves on each plant was estimated by counting the number of branches then multiplying by a factor of 26 leaves per branch, which was predetermined based on the branch and leaf counts for plants in randomly selected 24 pots. Disease incidence was determined by dividing the diseased leaf count by total leaf estimate.</p>
<p id="p-0249" num="0242">To determine SSG survival in soilless potting mix, a 100 mg sample was taken from the top 2 cm in each container using a straw. Each potting mix sample was added to a test tube with 10 mL SDW then vortexed for 15 min. After diluting 10 to 10<sup>6 </sup>times, 100 &#x3bc;L of original prep or a dilution was spread onto a PDA plate after the debris settled. Small sage green colonies were counted after a 72 h incubation at 25&#xb0; C. Their SSG identity was verified with <i>Burkholderia cepacia </i>selective agar (BCSA, LabGenome, Houston, Tex., USA).</p>
<p id="p-0250" num="0000">SSG Species Identity and Differentiation from Epidemic Strains of <i>Burkholderia cepacia </i></p>
<p id="p-0251" num="0243">Three major steps were taken to determine SSG species identity. First, SSG was streaked onto BCSA medium and incubated at 25, 35, and 42&#xb0; C. for 72 h to determine whether it belongs to the Bcc. Second, DNA was extracted from SSG cells, then 16S rRNA and RecA genes were amplified by PCR using the universal primers 27F, 968F, and 1410R, and primers BCR1 and 2, respectively. PCR products were sequenced at Eton Bioscience (Research Triangle Park, Raleigh, N.C., USA). Processed sequences were deposited into GenBank (Accession: MK424809 for RecA gene and MK418913 for 16S DNA) and blasted against existing sequences in the NCBI repository and at EzBioCloud to determine the identity of this bacterial endophyte. Third, RecA PCR products were digested with HaeIII and MnII then their RFLP were analyzed as described previously to determine their genomovar association in the Bcc.</p>
<p id="p-0252" num="0244">Two additional steps were taken to assess SSG risk as a human health hazard. First, bacterial DNA was amplified with specific primers for the Bcc epidemic strain marker (BCESM) to determine whether this endophyte is associated with any known opportunistic human pathogens in the complex. Second, an onion maceration assay was conducted to differentiate SSG from clinical strains that generally do not macerate onion bulb scale tissue. Briefly, pieces of fresh onion scales were wounded with a sterilized needle and inoculated with 10 &#x3bc;L of 40 h SSG culture at 10<sup>8 </sup>cells/mL or NB as the control. The inoculated onion scales were incubated at 25&#xb0; C. in a moist container, and symptom development of onion scale tissue was recorded after 3 days.</p>
<heading id="h-0045" level="2">Data Analysis</heading>
<p id="p-0253" num="0245">Data from different experimental runs, if homogenous, were pooled then subjected to analysis of variance (ANOVA) to determine the level of difference among treatments and that of interactions among factors using Statistical Analysis Software version 9.4 (SAS Institute, Cary, N.C., USA). Otherwise, they were analyzed by an experimental run. Treatment means were separated according to the least significant difference (LSD) test at p=0.05.</p>

<heading id="h-0047" level="2">SSG Effect on Cps Conidia Survival and Germination</heading>
<p id="p-0254" num="0246">Difference was observed in germination of conidia among Cell, CFS, and PDB treatments (p&#x3c;0.01), but not between the two experimental runs (p=0.19) nor among the exposure times (p=0.23). There were, however, significant interactions between treatment and exposure time (p&#x3c;0.01). About 52% of conidia in control wells with PDB germinated within 1 h; their germination rate increased with time, reaching 100% at 48 h (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>8</b></figref>) with germling aggregation and further development into hyphae (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>9</b></figref>). In contrast, conidia germinated at a much lower rate in wells with CFS than those in control wells. None of the conidia in wells with SSG cells germinated over the 48-h period; in fact, they were all lysed. Similar conidial lysis was observed in wells with CFS, but to a lesser extent. Conidia that had not been lysed had an empty cell, they germinated poorly, and fewer germlings developed further (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>9</b></figref>).</p>
<heading id="h-0048" level="2">Effect of SSG on Boxwood Blight</heading>
<p id="p-0255" num="0247">Substantial blight control was seen on &#x2018;Justin Brouwers&#x2019; plants pretreated with resuspended SSG cells or CFS one day prior to inoculation with Cps. Resuspended SSG cells were consistently more effective than CFS for blight control in all experiments (p&#x3c;0.01). The former reduced blight incidence by nearly 100% when compared to the control with 0.01% polysorbate 20. Comparatively, CFS reduced blight incidence by 73% when compared to the control with NB. No difference in blight control among three experimental runs (p=0.31) nor any interaction between experiment run and treatment (p=0.35) was observed.</p>
<heading id="h-0049" level="2">Effect of SSG Concentration on Boxwood Blight</heading>
<p id="p-0256" num="0248">Greater blight severity was observed (p&#x3c;0.01) on control plants in initial than repeated experiments (98% vs. 33% leaves blighted) due to the difference in Cps inoculum concentration between the two runs (5&#xd7;10<sup>4 </sup>vs. 2&#xd7;10<sup>4 </sup>conidia/mL).</p>
<p id="p-0257" num="0249">Blight incidence decreased (p&#x3c;0.01) with increasing SSG cell concentration: 83% on boxwood pretreated with SSG at 3&#xd7;10<sup>3 </sup>cfu/mL and 1% on those at 3&#xd7;10<sup>9 </sup>cfu/mL in the initial experiment (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>10</b></figref>). A similar decreasing trend was observed in the repeated experiment: 18% leaves blighted at 2&#xd7;10<sup>5 </sup>cfu/mL and 1/10 percent at 2&#xd7;10<sup>9 </sup>cfu/mL (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>10</b></figref>).</p>
<heading id="h-0050" level="2">Effect of SSG Treatment Lead Time on Boxwood Blight</heading>
<p id="p-0258" num="0250">When boxwood plants were cover sprayed with SSG at 4&#xd7;10<sup>8 </sup>cfu/mL prior to inoculation with Cps, significant differences were observed in blight control between two experimental runs (p=0.01) and four lead times (p&#x3c;0.01). Blight control was over 99% in both runs when SSG was applied one day prior to inoculation with Cps, and the control efficacy decreased with increasing lead time (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>11</b></figref>). Specifically, this decrease was significant between the lead times of 10 and 20 days, but not between 1 and 10 days, nor between 20 and 30 days in both runs.</p>
<heading id="h-0051" level="2">Effect of Post-Inoculation SSG Treatment on Boxwood Blight</heading>
<p id="p-0259" num="0251">SSG applied 3 h post-inoculation reduced blight by 98% (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>12</b></figref>). However, blight control decreased (p&#x3c;0.01) with increasing time: 62% at 48 h post-inoculation. No difference was observed in blight control between two experimental runs (p=0.23).</p>
<heading id="h-0052" level="2">SSG Effect on Potential of Diseased Leaves as a Source of Inoculum</heading>
<p id="p-0260" num="0252">More conidia were produced consistently on diseased leaf litter cover sprayed with NB than that treated with NB culture containing both SSG cells and metabolites in experiments (p&#x3c;0.01, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>13</b></figref>). Conidia production of both treatments decreased steadily with increasing post-treatment time (p&#x3c;0.01). The number of conidia produced on NB-treated leaf litter was 144,542/cm<sup>2 </sup>and 33,888/cm<sup>2 </sup>at 5 and 50 days post-treatment, respectively. Likewise, the number of conidia produced on SSG-treated leaf litter was 98,756/cm<sup>2 </sup>and 5,231/cm<sup>2 </sup>at 5 and 50 days post-treatment, respectively.</p>
<p id="p-0261" num="0253">Conidia produced on the leaf litter resulted in boxwood blight on the lower portion of Justin Brouwers plants. However, a higher percentage of leaves developed blight symptoms from the control litter cover sprayed with NB than those treated with SSG (11% vs. 1%, p&#x3c;0.01). Difference was not observed in blight incidence between two experimental runs (p=0.25) nor among six assessment dates (p=0.70).</p>
<p id="p-0262" num="0254">SSG population in sampled potting mix declined over the 50 day period (p&#x3c;0.01) with 6&#xd7;10<sup>9 </sup>and 2&#xd7;10<sup>6 </sup>cfu/g at the beginning and termination of the study, respectively. The variety and population of other microbes recovered along with SSG also declined during the same period, and this decline was most obvious for fungi. SSG was never detected in control potting mix treated with NB.</p>
<p id="p-0263" num="0000">SSG Species Identity and Differentiation from Epidemic Strains of <i>Burkholderia cepacia </i></p>
<p id="p-0264" num="0255">Several lines of evidence supported SSG's membership in the Bcc, although it does not seem to belong to any known species. It grew well in <i>B. cepacia </i>selective agar at 25&#xb0; C. and 37&#xb0; C., but not 42&#xb0; C. Its 16S rDNA sequence also was 99% identical to many known species in the Bcc with <i>B. cepacia </i>JCM 2799 and <i>Burkholderia </i>sp. JJOA-S as the closest match when being blasted through NCBI and EzBioCloud, respectively. Likewise, its RecA gene sequence had the best alignment with that of <i>B. cepacia </i>strain IST431. When SSG RecA PCR products were digested with HaeIII and MnII restriction enzymes, they produced a RFLP pattern that was similar to type &#x201c;H&#x201d; of genomovar III and type &#x201c;d&#x201d; of genomovar I, respectively. This result indicated that SSG belonged to neither genomovar I nor III because the expected RFLP pattern for genomovar I was &#x201c;D&#x201d; with HaeIII digestion, and for genomovar III was &#x201c;g&#x201d; with Mn/I digestion.</p>
<p id="p-0265" num="0256">Both ID and RFLP indicated that SSG was distinct from all known clinical strains in the Bcc. In addition, SSG DNA was not amplified with the <i>B. cepacia </i>epidemic strain marker. Furthermore, unlike clinical strains, SSG macerated onion scale tissues (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>15</b></figref>).</p>
<heading id="h-0053" level="1">Discussion</heading>
<p id="p-0266" num="0257">This study identified a potent <i>Burkholderia </i>endophyte, SSG, with both protective and curative properties against boxwood blight. As a protectant, SSG at 10<sup>8 </sup>cfu/mL applied one day prior to inoculation with Cps provided almost complete protection of Justin Brouwers boxwood, a highly susceptible cultivar under high disease pressure environments (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>11</b></figref>). This blight control efficacy is comparable to those of the most effective fungicides. In fact, it performed much better than the most effective biofungicides and all biocontrol agents identified to date, including RootShield Plus, non-indigenous isolates of <i>Trichoderma koningiopsis</i>, and <i>Pseudomonas protegens</i>, as well as an indigenous strain of <i>Pseudomonas lactis</i>. As a curative agent, SSG reduced blight by 98% when its cell suspension at 10<sup>8 </sup>cfu/mL was applied 3 h after inoculation with Cps (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>12</b></figref>).</p>
<p id="p-0267" num="0258">In addition to directly protecting boxwood plants from infection by Cps, SSG greatly affected other major steps in the boxwood blight disease cycle. First, fallen diseased leaves are important sources of inoculum for new infection. SSG reduced the pathogen's ability to produce conidia on diseased leaf litter by 32% at 5 days after cover spray treatment; this reduction rate increased with time: 85% at 40 days and longer (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>13</b></figref>). Second, conidia are the major dispersal and infective structure for boxwood blight. SSG at 10<sup>7 </sup>cfu/mL completely lysed conidia while CFS had a similar but lesser impact. Together, SSG is an effective biological sanitizer and may be used to reduce the pathogen population at sites of infestation.</p>
<p id="p-0268" num="0259">SSG may involve complex modes of action against Cps. First, some environmental Bcc species are known to produce unique antifungal antibiotics such as pyrrolnitrin, occidiofungin, and glidobactins. SSG may produce these antibiotics for suppression of Cps mycelial growth, although their species and mechanisms are yet to be elucidated. Second, SSG may also produce chitinases and glucanases that break down the cell wall building blocks, including chitin, glucans, and other polymers during the lysis process. The fact that conidia were lysed at a much greater rate in wells with live bacterial cells than those with CFS supports this hypothesis. Further studies on the molecular interactions between SSG and Cps are warranted to understand the modes of action by which SSG acts against Cps. It is worth noting that when Cps and SSG were grown in different sections of multisection Petri plates, no suppression was observed. Thus, the involvement of volatile compounds by SSG in Cps suppression is unlikely.</p>
<p id="p-0269" num="0260">Many endophytes can elicit plant resistance during plant infection, and more than likely, SSG is able to do the same in boxwood against boxwood blight. This hypothesis is supported by the fact that boxwood plants remained moderately protected from infection by Cps even 20 days and longer after SSG treatment (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>11</b></figref>). SSG may have elicited plant defenses that provide persistent resistance to the disease, although at low to moderate levels. Bcc bacteria survive poorly on leaf surfaces. The sustained blight control by SSG in the present study may also be due in part to their entry into plant tissue at a low rate that may continually act against Cps. Further study on the interaction between plant and SSG is warranted to elucidate the mechanisms underlying the sustained blight control.</p>
<p id="p-0270" num="0261">Bcc is a very diverse <i>Burkholderia </i>group including some opportunistic human pathogens that are associated with lung infection in patients with cystic fibrosis. Although SSG belongs to Bcc, its profiles do not match with those of any known species in this complex and its likelihood of being a human pathogen is low. First, SSG was tested negative for BCESM, the standard human virulence marker used by the United States Environmental Protection Agency for registration of biocontrol products with Bcc as an active ingredient. With reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>15</b></figref>, SSG macerated 200 fresh onion scales, a phenomenon not observed for known clinical strains. Additionally, SSG was isolated from surface-sterilized plant tissue whereas all clinical strains were isolated from human tissue or waste.</p>
<p id="p-0271" num="0262">Although SSG may protect boxwood from infection by Cps for 3 to 4 weeks, longer than most fungicides currently labeled for protecting boxwood and/or controlling <i>Cylindrocladium </i>diseases, its efficacy decreased with time (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>11</b></figref>). This reduction in SSG efficacy with time may be due in part to a declining bacterial population. Therefore, the second question of practical importance is how SSG interacts with boxwood and how its survival inside and on the surface of boxwood foliage may be improved for sustained high blight control performance. Formulation and delivery methods could have tremendous impacts on the performance of microbial biocontrol agents. So, an additional question is how SSG may be formulated and delivered to enhance its entry and survival inside and on the surface of boxwood plants for sustained survival and blight control performance. Nevertheless, this study identified a highly potent biocontrol agent with protectant, curative, and sanitizing properties.</p>
<heading id="h-0054" level="1">Example 7: SSG Genome</heading>
<p id="p-0272" num="0263">SSG genome DNA was extracted from overnight cultures in nutrient broth (BD, Sparks, Md.) at 28&#xb0; C. using NucleoSpin&#xae; Microbial DNA-Macherey Nagel (TaKaRa Bio, Bethlehem, Pa.) and quantified using Quantus&#x2122; Fluorometer (Promega, Madison, Wis.). Sequencing was performed on a MinION device (Oxford Nanopore Technologies, Oxford, United Kingdom). The sequencing library was prepared with the ligation sequencing kit (SQK-LSK109) according to the manufacturer's instructions and run in a FLO-MIN106 (R9.4.1) flow cell. Sequence basecalling was performed using MinKnow (Oxford Nanopore, Oxford, United Kingdom) at Q Score of 11 and run option of Fast5 for 20 h. Fastq files with a total of 9.46 Gb bases from 1.19 million reads that passed the Q score were used for de novo genome assembly using Canu version 1.8 with the default parameters for Nanopore data. After read correction and trimming, the final assembly from the retained single largest high-quality chunk of sequences resulted in a sequence with a total length of 8,571,737 bp and an average GC content of 66.9% arranged in six contigs. The genome coverage is 108.64-fold (N50=5,470,797) (Table 2). The assembly was annotated using Prokka 1.14.1 and Rast 2.0. Prokka predicted 9039 protein-coding sequences (CDS) and 76 tRNA, nine rRNA and one tmRNA. Rast predicted 10209 CDS, 67 tRNAs, 18 rRNAs and one tmRNA.</p>

<p id="p-0274" num="0264">Eight hundred and sixty-six secondary metabolism gene clusters were detected through Rast analysis. 15 gene clusters related to antibiotic biosynthesis were detected with antiSMASH 5, which included genes for nonribosomal peptide synthetase (NRPS), polyketide synthase (PKS), pyrrolnitrinis and bacteriocin production (Table 3). These clusters accounted for 6% of the genome assembly. This genome capacity for antibiotic biosynthesis is more than twice that of other analyzed Bcc species. This feature of SSG is consistent to its potent antagonism we observed on oomycete, some bacterial and fungal pathogens. Interestingly, except for gene cluster for biosynthesis of terpene that has been used for pesticide (Table 3), through Prokka and Rast annotation, we identified genes for production of insecticidal photopexin and presqualene diphosphate synthase (hpnD).</p>

<p id="p-0278" num="0266">These results supported SSG as a possible potent biocontrol agent for plant diseases. They also indicated that SSG may also be a candidate biocontrol agent for insect pests and a biofertilizer.</p>
<p id="p-0279" num="0267">SSG was identified as <i>B. cepacia </i>through genome-based identification on TrueBac&#x2122; ID. The average nucleotide identity (ANI) between the genomes and the type strain of <i>B. cepacia </i>was 98.4%. (ANI coverage of 94.8%). However, multilocus sequence typing (MLST) of the SSG genome sequence revealed that SSG contains only three of the seven loci that are used for differentiation of species in the Bcc. Although SSG had the same allele number at atpD as two strains of Bcc (BCC0412, IST431) and the same allele number at lep as one strain (BCC0218) of Bcc in genomovar I, the overall SSG allelic profile did not match any Bcc that has been listed previously, indicating divergence of SSG from other species in this genomovar that uses <i>B. cepacia </i>as a representative.</p>
<p id="p-0280" num="0268">Clinically important isolates of Bcc are most commonly members of genomovars II and III, with few human pathogens contained within genomovar I. To determine if SSG was different from clinical strains, we searched for the cable pilin gene encoding <i>Burkholderia cepacia </i>epidemic strain marker (BCESM) in the predicted CDS by Prokka and Rast. We did not find any CDS for the gene, indicating an absence of BCESM, which is consistent with PCR results in a previous study. Together with the presence of genes involving in nitrogen fixation that is a missing trait in clinical Bcc strains, SSG is a unique member of the Bcc which is distinct from clinical strains and appears to have great promise for agriculture and biotechnology applications.</p>

<heading id="h-0056" level="2">Isolate and Culture</heading>
<p id="p-0281" num="0269"><i>Burkholderia </i>sp. SSG isolate was deposited at the Virginia Tech Collection of <i>Phytophthora </i>and Beneficial Microbes (VTC) of the World Data Center for Microorganism (WDCM1197). SSG was grown on potato dextrose agar (PDA or nutrient agar (NA) or in nutrient broth (NB) (Becton, Dickinson and Company, Spark, Mo., USA) for 48 h at 25-28&#xb0; C. The culture was maintained at 4&#xb0; C. within a month after growth and stored at &#x2212;80&#xb0; C.</p>
<heading id="h-0057" level="2">IAA Production</heading>
<p id="p-0282" num="0270">IAA production by SSG was determined quantitatively using a published colorimetric method with a minor change. A single colony of SSG on a streak plate was transferred into four milliliters of NB containing four milligrams of tryptophan. After a 72-h incubation at 28&#xb0; C., 1.5 mL SSG broth culture and NB without SSG as control was centrifuged at 13,523&#xd7;g for five minutes, 0.5 ml of the supernatant was then mixed with one milliliter of Salkowski's reagent in a 1.5-mL tube. The mixtures were incubated at 23&#xb0; C. for 30 min, then measured for absorbance at 530 nm after blanked with the control on Du&#xae;800 spectrophotometer (Beckman Coulter, Indianapolis, Ind., USA). The assay was run in triplicate and repeated once. The result was quantified using a standard curve of known IAA dilution series (Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, Mo., USA) at a range of 0.1 to 300 &#x3bc;g mL<sup>&#x2212;1</sup>.</p>
<heading id="h-0058" level="2">Nitrogen Fixation Ability</heading>
<p id="p-0283" num="0271">The nitrogen fixation ability of SSG was determined by growing SSG on nitrogen-free agar medium. Specifically, nitrogen-free agar plates were streaked with fresh SSG colonies on a PDA plate. Meanwhile nutrient agar plates as source of nitrogen were also streaked as positive control. After a four-day incubation at 25&#xb0; C., the plates were examined for bacterial growth. The assay was conducted in triplicate and repeated once.</p>
<heading id="h-0059" level="2">Phosphate Solubilization</heading>
<p id="p-0284" num="0272">The ability of SSG to solubilize phosphate was determined using the National Botanical Research Institute's Phosphate (NBRIP) medium broth or plate and colorimetric method with minor modifications. For the plate assay, three sterilized Whatman filter paper disks were placed as an equilateral triangle in NBRIP agar plates. A 10-&#x3bc;L aliquot of SSG cell culture stock was added to each disk. Control disks received the same amount of nutrient broth without SSG. All plates were examined for the development of halo around the disks after incubated at 27&#xb0; C. for seven days. For the broth colorimetric assay, 150 mg Ca<sub>3</sub>(PO<sub>4</sub>)<sub>2 </sub>as an insoluble form of phosphate was included in a 30 mL NBRIP broth. In the broth, 0.3 mL of overnight SSG culture in NB or NB alone was added. After incubated on a shaker at 27&#xb0; C. for seven days, the broth was centrifuged at 13416&#xd7;g for 10 min. The supernatant was autoclaved for 20 min and stored at 4&#xb0; C. To determine soluble phosphate release into the solution, one milliliter of the supernatant or its dilution of samples was added with two milliliters of 2.5% ammonium molybdate and 0.5 ml of 10 M sulfuric acid, then mixed with one milliliter of 0.5 M hydrazine hydrate solution and filled with SDW to 25 mL. The resultant solutions were blanked with the supernatant of the control and measured for the absorbance at 840 nm on the spectrophotometer (Beckman Coulter, Indianapolis, Ind., USA). When the absorbance of a sample was one or smaller, soluble phosphate in the sample was calculated with the formulation: sample absorbance/0.1235+0.0018. When the absorbance of a sample was one or greater, it was calculated with diluted samples. Both assays included three replicates and were repeated once.</p>
<heading id="h-0060" level="2">Siderophore Production</heading>
<p id="p-0285" num="0273">Siderophore production by SSG was determined using a blue agar medium containing chrome azurol S (CAS) and the indicator hexadecyltrimethylammonium bromide. Specifically, the media plates were streaked with SSG and incubated at 25&#xb0; C. Plate color change was examined after 48 h. Plates with a color change from blue to yellow were recorded as positive. This assay included three replicate plates, and the assay was repeated twice.</p>
<heading id="h-0061" level="2">Plant Treatment and Growth Measurement</heading>
<p id="p-0286" num="0274">Three boxwood cultivars of different growth rates, <i>Buxus sempervirens </i>&#x2018;Justin Brouwers&#x2019; (slow), &#x2018;Buddy&#x2019; (intermedium) and <i>B. microphylla </i>var. <i>japonica </i>&#x2018;Winter Gem&#x2019; (fast) were used in this study. These cultivars with two plants were grown in 3.8-I containers and maintained in a greenhouse before use. One week before SSG treatment in November 2018, plants were pulled out containers, separated and weighed after the potting mix was removed and plants were rinsed with tap water. Weighted individual plants were repotted with a mixture of Scotts&#xae; Premium Potting Soil (Marysville, Ohio) and pine barks (Pacific Mulch Inc, Henderson, N.C.) at 1/3 to 2/3 ratio in 3.8-L containers. These plants were watered manually to saturate the soil after potting, then drip-irrigated every other day for one min.</p>
<p id="p-0287" num="0275">Plants were inoculated by drenching SSG cell suspension. To prepare SSG cell suspension, 150 mL of NB was inoculated in a flask with one milliliter of the stock, an overnight culture of SSG in NB, and incubated at 28&#xb0; C. on a shaker for 40 h. Three flasks of the culture were used for an experiment. The culture was centrifuged at 8,275&#xd7;g for 15 min to precipitate cells that were resuspended in 500 mL Phosphate-Buffered Saline (PBS) (pH=7.4) after supernatant was removed. A 50-mL aliquot of SSG resuspension at 10<sup>8 </sup>cfu/mL or the same amount of PBS was evenly poured onto the potting mix around plants in a container. After treatment, containers were arranged in a randomized complete block design and dripping irrigation was resumed for plants in two days. In March 2019, plants were moved from the green house to a gravel pad outside where they were overhead irrigated. In September 2019, plants were pulled out again and weighted after root cleaning as done at the beginning of the experiment in November 2018. The monthly growth rate was calculated by dividing the difference in plant weight between measurements at the beginning and end of the experiments by 10 for each replicate of cultivar and treatment combination. The experiment was conducted three times.</p>
<heading id="h-0062" level="2">Statistical Analysis</heading>
<p id="p-0288" num="0276">Plant growth data from three repeated experiments were subjected to homogeneity test and subsequently pooled for further analyses. Analysis of variance was conducted using the Statistical Analysis Software Version 9.4 (SAS Institute, Cary, N.C.). Treatment means were separated by boxwood cultivar according to the least significant difference at P=0.05.</p>
<heading id="h-0063" level="1">Example 9: Results and Discussion for Characterization of Boxwood Endophytic <i>Burkholderia cepacia </i>SSG as a Plant Growth Promoter</heading>
<heading id="h-0064" level="2">Indole-3-Acetic Acid (IAA) Production</heading>
<p id="p-0289" num="0277">IAA was detected in the cell-free supernatant of SSG culture two days after NB broth containing tryptophan was inoculated (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>17</b>A, <b>17</b>B</figref>). The estimated yield was 2.9-4.5 &#x3bc;g/mL that had no change with increasing growth time. No color change was observed in the same medium that was not inoculated with SSG. These results indicated that SSG was able to produce IAA. It is not clear whether this IAA yield of SSG is common in IAA producing <i>Burkholderia </i>due to lack of quantitative data for other <i>Burkholderia</i>. However, it is relatively low compared to some non-<i>Burkholderia </i>bacterial endophytes that produce 9.6-43 &#x3bc;g IAA/mL. Surprisingly, genes encoding tryptophan-2-monooxygeanse or tryptophan transaminase were not found in the SSG genome despite that there are genes for tryptophan production. These enzymes play important roles in the pathways of tryptophan-dependent IAA biosynthesis in bacteria (<i>Pseudomonas </i>and <i>Agrobacterium</i>) and plants. SSG producing IAA in the experiment without these genes suggests that this bacterium may use a different pathway from those currently known, which remains to be investigated.</p>
<p id="p-0290" num="0278">IAA is the basic and most potent auxin natively occurring and functioning in plants and it regulates leaf and flower development. SSG is the first IAA-producing burkholderial bacterium from boxwood leaves based on our knowledge, while other IAA-producing <i>Burkholderia </i>are found in stem, root, and rhizosphere. SSG can survive in soil, indicating that it may also be a rhizosphere endophyte. This bacterium might have been as a boxwood symbiont facilitating the growth of plants, although whether and how SSG may move in the plant deserve a further investigation.</p>
<heading id="h-0065" level="2">Nitrogen Fixation</heading>
<p id="p-0291" num="0279">SSG grew on the N-free medium, indicating its ability to fix atmospheric nitrogen (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>17</b>C, <b>17</b>D</figref>). This trait is expected as the SSG genome contains a nitrogenase gene (eg. NifQ) and a hgIE cluster, heterocyst glycolipid synthase-like PKS involving nitrogen fixation in cyanobacteria heterocyst, as well as other genes for nitrogen fixation and regulation such as pstN and gInB. Nitrogen fixation has been found in various endophytic bacteria although it is not common for Bcc. As a new nitrogen-fixing member of Bcc following B. vietinamiensis, SSG may be a great resource of boxwood plants in nitrogen acquisition and metabolism.</p>

<p id="p-0292" num="0280">Phosphate solubilization of SSG was evaluated using milky NBRIP agar media (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>17</b>E, <b>17</b>F</figref>). Around disks with SSG there was a clear halo initially seen on the third day of placing the disk. The halo enlarged with increasing incubation time. On day seven, the halo was evident and had diameter 14 mm (&#xb1;0.3). No halo was present in any control plate without SSG. Weak phosphate-solubilizing bacteria do not display halo in the plate assay. The halo formulation with SSG suggests that the bacterium is a potent phosphate solubilizer. The solubilized phosphate was 206.4 ppm (&#xb1;5.0) as estimated on the seventh day after treatment using a colorimetric method by which solubilization of Ca<sub>3</sub>(PO<sub>4</sub>)<sub>2 </sub>in the broth remained detectable after the sample was diluted 100-fold. This amount was about four percent of the insoluble form of phosphate, which is slightly lower than that of other reported strong phosphate solubilizing bacterial endophytes, including <i>Burkholderia </i>spp. This difference among bacteria may have resulted from quantification methods used for insoluble phosphate. In this study we used the colorimetric method instead of the optical density of the broth. Phosphate-solubilizing bacteria can improve crop yield when used to inoculate seed or soil due to the release of insoluble and fixed forms of phosphorus. As a member of these bacteria, SSG is a great phosphorus resource for plants.</p>
<heading id="h-0067" level="2">Siderophore Production</heading>
<p id="p-0293" num="0281">Siderophores from microorganisms can be used by the plant as an iron nutrient source, alleviating the stresses imposed on plants by high levels of heavy metals in soil and plant pathogen suppression. SSG was a strong siderophore producer, as indicated by decolorating blue chrome azurol S agar 48 h after the plate was streaked with SSG (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>17</b>G, <b>17</b>H</figref>). No color change occurred in control plates. This is supported by SSG genome sequencing showing that there are more than 100 genes or copies involving in siderophore biosynthesis, assembly and metabolism. However, further studies are warranted to understand how these siderophores may be used for plant growth promotion.</p>
<heading id="h-0068" level="2">Effect of SSG as Inoculant on Boxwood Plant Growth</heading>
<p id="p-0294" num="0282">SSG was used to inoculate boxwood roots to evaluate whether it may stimulate plant growth over a 10-month period. Plant growth showed no difference between three repeated experiments (P=0.6905) nor interaction between cultivar and treatment (P=0.2121), cultivar and experiment (P=0.1366) and between treatment and experiment (P=0.2434). However, there was significant difference between SSG inoculated and uninoculated treatments, although the difference varied with cultivar (P&#x3c;0.0001). SSG consistently promoted plant growth of all three boxwood cultivars when compared to PBS. Specifically, SSG resulted in an increase of monthly growth rate that is 58%, 76%, and 37% greater than that of the control in Buddy (P=0.0236), Justin Brouwers (P=0.0014), and Winer Gem (P=0.0190), respectively. Leaf number increase has been observed for boxwood Justin Brouwers in containers with diseased leaf debris that was sprayed with SSG culture in a previous study of boxwood blight control with SSG. In that study, it was not certain whether the leaf increase resulted from plant growth or disease reduction. This study confirmed SSG as a plant growth bacterium contributing to the new growth of leaves. Justin Brouwers is a slow growth boxwood cultivar while Buddy and Winter Gem are medium and fast growth cultivars, respectively. SSG appeared more effective on promoting slow and medium growth plants than fast growth plants (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>18</b></figref>). This study demonstrated the ability of SSG to produce IAA and siderophore, fix nitrogen and solubilize phosphorus as predicted by the genome sequencing. These features, together with its other features such as potent antagonism against pathogens and low human health risk may allow SSG to become a prospective biocontrol agent and PGPB in agriculture.</p>

<p id="p-0295" num="0283">Microorganisms and their Growth Conditions</p>
<p id="p-0296" num="0284">Except for SSG and tomato spotted wilt virus, information of other microbes used in this study were listed in Tables 5 and 6. Potato dextrose broth (PDB), nutrient broth (NB) (Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, Mo., USA), or 5% clarified V8 medium broth (V8B) and their agar plates were used for culture and growth of fungi, bacteria, and oomycetes, respectively at 23-28&#xb0; C. depending on the experiment.</p>
<heading id="h-0070" level="2">Dual Culture Assay</heading>
<p id="p-0297" num="0285">Dual-culture assays were performed differently on agar medium plates depending on target microorganisms. For fungi and oomycetes, a 0.45 cm diameter plug of a week-old agar culture was placed in the center of a PDA plate between two streaks of SSG overnight broth culture or two streaks of NB medium as the control. Diameters of the targets were measured 1-4 weeks after the plates were incubated at 25&#xb0; C. For target bacteria, 100 &#x3bc;L of overnight culture in NB were spread on NA plates, and three sterilized disks (0.7 cm in diameter) of Whatman filter paper No. 1 were placed at three angles of an equilateral triangle in the center of the plates, and each was dropped with 10 &#x3bc;L SSG cell culture stock or NB as the control. Diameters of suppression halo zone from the disks were measured 72 h after the treatment at 25&#xb0; C. For each target isolate/strain, three replicate plates were included. Each assay was repeated at least twice.</p>
<heading id="h-0071" level="2"><i>Phytophthora </i>Zoospore Germination Suppression by SSG</heading>
<p id="p-0298" num="0286">While germination suppression of fungal conidia by SSG has been reported, this study focused on zoospore germination suppression. <i>P. capsici </i>was used for easy zoospore production as described previously. 100 &#x3bc;L of zoospore suspension at 10<sup>5</sup>/mL was added into 1 mL PDB containing 50 &#x3bc;L SSG cell suspension at 10<sup>7 </sup>cfu/mL, SSG culture cell-free supernatant (CFS) or the control PDB alone in a well of 6-well plates. Four replicate wells were used for each treatment and examined for morphological changes of zoospores under a microscope 24 and 48 h after the addition of zoospores. The assay was repeated once.</p>
<heading id="h-0072" level="2">Plants and Growth Conditions</heading>
<p id="p-0299" num="0287">Eleven plant species/cultivars were used for disease suppression experiments with SSG. They were started from seed, seedlings or grown plants at Hampton Roads Agricultural Research and Extension Center (HRAREC). Experimental plants were watered with a drip or overhead irrigation programmed for best growth of plants and maintained greenhouse or gravel pad at HRAREC before use.</p>
<p id="p-0300" num="0288">Annual <i>vinca </i>(<i>Catharanthus roseus </i>&#x2018;Little Bright Eye&#x2019;) and pepper (<i>Capsicum annuum </i>L. &#x2018;California Wonder&#x2019;) plants were started from seeds as described previously. Plants were grown in the greenhouse for 4-8 weeks before use after transplantation with 2-3 seedlings per pot with dimensions of 15.9&#xd7;14.7 cm.</p>
<p id="p-0301" num="0289">Two-year Fraser fir (<i>Abies fraseri</i>) seedlings and 6-8-week seedling plugs of garden pansy (Viola tricolor var. <i>hortensis</i>), geranium (<i>Pelargonium </i>&#x2018;American White&#x2019;), <i>impatiens </i>(<i>Impatiens walleriana </i>&#x2018;Beacon Orange&#x2019;), and <i>petunia </i>(<i>Petunia&#xd7;hybrida </i>&#x2018;Wave&#xae; Misty Lilac Hybrid&#x2019;) were purchased from nurseries. All the seedlings were transplanted, grown in pots with dimensions of 15.9&#xd7;14.7 cm and used after 6-8 weeks.</p>
<p id="p-0302" num="0290">Potting mix used for transplanting contained 89% unamended aged pine bark (Pacific Organics, Henderson, N.C., USA), 10% Metro-Mix 830 (Sungro Horticulture, Mass., USA), 0.59% 16-6-11, 5-6 month-controlled release fertilizer (CRF) (Harrell's, Lakeland, Fla., USA), 0.06% Nitroform (Agrium Advanced Technologies, ON, Canada), 0.27% Pro Pulverized Limestone and 0.14% Pro Granular Limestone (Oldcastle Lawn &#x26; Garden, Pa., USA) for a pH at 6.5-7.</p>

All plants were watered with a drip or overhead irrigation and maintained in the greenhouse or grovel pad at HRAREC before use.</p>
<heading id="h-0073" level="2">Inoculum Preparation</heading>
<p id="p-0304" num="0292">Overnight broth culture SSG was used as a stock to make an inoculum for a plant treatment before or after inoculation with a pathogen. 350 mL NB was added to 1 mL of the stock and shaken for 40 h at 28&#xb0; C. to get culture at a concentration range of 10<sup>8 </sup>cfu/mL as described in a previous study. The control was NB or sterile distilled water (SDW) depending on the suspension used.</p>
<p id="p-0305" num="0293">Foliage inocula of <i>Phytophthora </i>including <i>P. capsici, P. nicotianae</i>, and <i>P. ramorum </i>were prepared with zoospores produced as described previously, respectively. <i>P. nicotianae </i>used for root inoculum was isolates from <i>petunia </i>(30J5 and 31A3). Concentrations of zoospore suspensions were adjusted with soil water extract to one at a range of 10<sup>4 </sup>zoospores/mL. Inoculum of <i>P. cinnamomi </i>used three isolates (28D5, 28E3, 28E6) from Fraser fir was made with 25 g double autoclaved Mahatma long grain rice soaked 18 mL dH<sub>2</sub>O in a 250-mL flask. The rice was inoculated with four agar culture plugs and incubated at 23&#xb0; C. The inoculum was ready in about 10 days, during which the flask was tapped daily to redistribute grains until grains became powdery white.</p>
<p id="p-0306" num="0294">Inocula of fungi including Collectortrichum <i>fruticola</i>, C. gleosporiodes, <i>Botrytis cinerea</i>, and <i>Volutella buxi </i>were prepared with conidia produced from 10 to 14 days old PDA cultures. Concentrations of conidial suspensions were adjusted with 0.01% polysorbate 20 to a range of 10<sup>5-6 </sup>conidia/mL.</p>
<p id="p-0307" num="0295">Inoculum of <i>Xanthomonas </i>campastris was prepared from 3-day culture of the bacteria at 30&#xb0; C. on PDA plates. At inoculation, the culture was resuspended in 0.01% polysorbate 20 to have a concentration of 8&#xd7;10<sup>7 </sup>cfu/mL determined with a previously described platting method used for SSG.</p>
<p id="p-0308" num="0296">Infected tomato plants with typical symptoms of tomato spotted wilt in a vegetable garden at HRAREC were used as inoculum source of TSWV for <i>impatiens </i>natural inoculation. Prior to inoculation, a pathogenicity test was conducted using a symptomized leaf sap. Specifically, the collected diseased leaf was cut and ground in a small volume of 0.01 M phosphate buffer at pH 7.0 with carborundum (Fisher Scientific, N.J., USA). The 10-fold diluted sap and sap from healthy leaves as the control were used to gently rub <i>impatiens </i>leaves. Plants inoculated with the sap from diseased plant showed necrotic spots after a few days, indicating diseased tomato plants could be used as an effective inoculum source.</p>
<p id="p-0309" num="0000">Plant Treatment with SSG</p>
<p id="p-0310" num="0297">For foliage treatment with SSG, plants were placed in moist chambers and applied with the inoculum or the control with a hand sprayer until dripping before or after inoculated with a pathogen inoculum, lead times for pretreatment with SSG before inoculation included one day (1db), one week (1wb), two (2wb) or four weeks (4wb). Post-time treatment with SSG after inoculation with a pathogen was 3 days (3da). For each treatment, 3 replicate pots were included. Treated plants were removed from the moist chamber the next day and overhead irrigation was resumed on the third day after treatment.</p>
<p id="p-0311" num="0298">For root treatment, each Fraser fir or <i>petunia </i>plant in a pot was drenched with 50 mL SSG inoculum or NB. Each treatment pot containing 3 replicate plants. Irrigation remained the same after treatment.</p>
<p id="p-0312" num="0000">Plant Inoculation with a Pathogen</p>
<p id="p-0313" num="0299">Pathogen inoculation was conducted at one day, one week, two weeks, or 4 weeks after the treatment or three days before the treatment. Prior to inoculation, SSG treated and control plants were arranged with a randomized block design. For foliage inoculation with a fungus or <i>Phytophthora</i>, the inoculation was conducted with a hand sprayer as did for SSG. For inoculation with <i>X. campestris</i>, plant leaves were injured with push pins, five pinches per leaf, and then sprayed with the bacterial inoculum. Inoculated plants were kept in a moist chamber for 48 h before placed in a shade area with mist or hand watering until disease rating.</p>
<p id="p-0314" num="0300">Inoculation of root pathogens used two methods. For P. cinnomomi, it was done with rice grain inocula. Four grains were placed in a hole at each of three plants in a pot. For <i>P. nicotianae</i>, it was done by drenching 5 mL inocula around the crown of each plant. Overhead irrigation was not disrupted before plants were rated for diseases. Natural inoculation (<i>thrips</i>) was conducted for TSWV. SSG treated or control <i>impatiens </i>plants were placed in a place surrounded by diseased tomato plants in the vegetable garden where 30 min/day overhead irrigation was carried out.</p>
<p id="p-0315" num="0301">After a week of exposure, plants were moved back to the gravel pad with regular irrigation. Plants were assessed 10-20 days after inoculation for disease severity with a 1-10 scale: 1=1-10%, 2=11-20% up to 10=91-100% infection of plants or plant parts. Each experiment was repeated at least once.</p>
<heading id="h-0074" level="2">Data Analysis</heading>
<p id="p-0316" num="0302">Data from each experiment and phytopathosystem were analyzed using the Microsoft Excel 2010 data function. Statistics used standard analysis of variance (ANOVA) Two-Factor with Replication or t-Test assuming equal variance at a (significant level)=0.05.

<p id="p-0321" num="0305">Specifically, fast-growing species such as <i>Botrytis cinerea </i>were less affected compared to slow-growing species.</p>
<p id="p-0322" num="0306">Bacterial suppression by SSG depended on species. Suppression halo zones that were larger than 1.5 cm in diameter were observed for three species, <i>X. campestris, P. syringae</i>, and <i>S. maltophilia </i>(Table 5). SSG also strongly suppressed <i>E. coli </i>although the suppression was not as strong as for <i>X. campestris </i>and <i>P. syringae </i>(<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>16</b></figref>). However, it did not suppress <i>E. carotovora </i>and suppression of <i>R. solanacearum </i>was weak (Table 5).</p>
<p id="p-0323" num="0307">The effects of SSG on culture growth of bacterial, fungal and oomycete pathogens indicate that SSG is a broad-spectrum antagonist. This conclusion is consistent with SSG great genomic capacity for antibiotic production estimated by genome sequencing. SSG contains not only synthase cluster of pyrrolnitrin, an antibiotic for fungi and streptomycetes and gram positive bacteria, but also gene clusters for bacteriocin production, polyketide synthase (PKS) and nonribosomal peptide synthetase (NRPS). The latter has been linked with synthesis of occidiofungins or burkholdines, a new antibiotic effective against fungal pathogens and <i>Pythium</i>, a relative of <i>Phytophthora</i>. Activities of SSG in dual culture assays suggests that SSG is capable to produce such antibiotics and other beyond through diffusing in agar which can effectively inhibit growth of fungal, oomycete and some bacterial pathogens. Despite that SSG may produce bacteriocin that may contribute to inhibition of five out of six test bacterial pathogens, it may not produce kasugammycin (kasumin), an effective bactericide for <i>Erwinia </i>sp due to the fact that <i>E. carotovora </i>was not suppressed in the dual culture assay. Efficacy of SSG on Gram positive bacterial pathogens remained unknown despite the fact that SSG can produce pyrrolnitrin effective on these pathogens.</p>
<heading id="h-0077" level="2">Zoospore Lysis and Germination Inhibition</heading>
<p id="p-0324" num="0308">As an important <i>Phytophthora </i>pathogen and large zoospore producer, P. capcisi was used for zoospore germination test. Almost all zoospores lysed 24 h after incubation with resuspended SSG cells while the control without SSG cells did not (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b></figref>). To determine whether the suppression was resulted from antibiotics produced, zoospores were also incubated with cell free supernatant of the SSG culture (CFS). Poor gemination of the zoospores as for treatment with SSG cell suspension was observed. However, in CFS treatment there were many fewer lysed cysts compared to that in SSG cells (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b></figref>), indicating that metabolites of SSG suppressed mainly germination but not lysis of zoospores. <i>P. capsici </i>zoospore lysis by <i>B. cepacia </i>metabolites has been reported previously. In that study, up to 10% zoospore lysis was observed within a one-hour time course which was significantly lower compared to a <i>Pseudomonas </i>isolate used. It is not clear whether SSG CFS may result in a different rate in the same time frame.</p>
<p id="p-0325" num="0309">Similar effects of SSG have also been observed in spore lysis and germination of fungal boxwood blight pathogen Cps. Oomycetes and fungi are different in cell wall composition. The former is composed of chitin, while the latter is made up of a mix of cellulosic compounds and glycan. To degrade cell wall degradation of these microorganisms, SSG must be a strong producer of lytic enzymes. Chitinase, &#x3b2;&#x2192;1,3-glucanase, and proteases are common lytic enzymes found in bacterial and fungal biocontrol agents. Except for chitinase and &#x3b2;&#x2192;1,3-glucanase, 58 genes encoding various proteases and five genes for biosynthesis of a-glucosidases and B-glucosidases that involve in cellulose degradation are present in the SSG genome. This suggests that SSG may use unusual mechanisms to lyse spores of fungi and <i>Phytophthora. </i></p>
<heading id="h-0078" level="2">Control of Plant Diseases by SSG</heading>
<p id="p-0326" num="0310">SSG was evaluated in 12 phytophathosystems involving ornamental plants and their pathogens, including bacteria, fungi, oomycetes and a virus. Up to five treatment times before and after plants were inoculated with a pathogen were investigated. SSG gave a disease control efficacy varied from phytopathosystems, pathogen types, and treatment intervals (Table 6). The highest efficacy was in <i>vinca</i>-<i>Phytophthora nicotianae</i>. Spraying plants with SSG cell suspension at one day before pathogen inoculation (1dbi) resulted in 95% disease reduction. The same treatment also resulted in more than 50% disease reduction in other five systems, <i>rhododendron </i>
<ul id="ul0003" list-style="none">
    <li id="ul0003-0001" num="0000">
    <ul id="ul0004" list-style="none">
        <li id="ul0004-0001" num="0311"><i>P. ramorum</i>, pepper&#x2014;P. capcisi, pansy&#x2014;<i>Alternaria </i>tenuissium, <i>hydrangea</i>&#x2014;Collectortrichum gleosporiodes, and geranium&#x2014;<i>Xanthomonas campestris</i>. Similar efficacy was also observed for treatments with an expanded interval, one week before inoculation (1wbi), in <i>rhododendron&#x2014; P. ramorum </i>and <i>hydrangea</i>&#x2014;C. gleosporiodes. However, decreased efficacies were observed at 2</li>
        <li id="ul0004-0002" num="0312">4 wbi. For <i>rhododendron&#x2014;P. ramorum</i>, the efficacy was 30% lower and for <i>hydrangea</i>&#x2014;Collectortrichum gleosporiodes, it was 20% lower. Performances of SSG in these systems are similar to that observed in boxwood-Cps, which suggests that SSG may use mechanisms mediated by direct antagonism or mixed-path antagonism. Plants treated with SSG and nutrient broth (CK) are shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>7</b>A-<b>7</b>D</figref>.</li>
    </ul>
    </li>
</ul>
</p>
<p id="p-0327" num="0313">SSG may also use other mechanisms for plant protection in other phytopathosystems. In <i>petunia&#x2014;Botrytis cinerea</i>, best efficacy did not occur in treatments at 1 bdi but did in the treatment at 1wdi. Even treatments at 2 wbi and 4 wbi were more effective than that at 1dbi. This pattern is similar to that found with fungal biocontrol agent <i>Trichoderma koningiopsis </i>for boxwood blight, which was more effective for treatments with great intervals, suggesting that disease suppression may result from indirect antagonism of the biocontrol agent through competition and induction of host resistance or the Induced Systemic Resistance (ISR). In pansy&#x2014;<i>C. fruticola</i>, SSG gave very similar protection for treatments at 1 dbi, 1 wbi and 2 wbi (Table 6) which may also be attributed to the same antagonism mechanism. In fact, SSG is a great producer of siderophores, indicating its ability of Fe deficiency response reduction and Fe acquisition improvement, which is an important feature of ISR eliciting microbes. With reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>7</b>B</figref>, SSG-treated <i>petunia </i>showed larger, healthier flowers 150 compared to nutrient broth-treated plants, which had numerous dead/browned parts 160.</p>
<p id="p-0328" num="0314">Post treatment with SSG was not as effective as pre-treatment in the phytopathosystems investigated. Among the evaluated six systems, the best result was found in geranium&#x2014;<i>Xanthomonas campestris </i>(Table 6). With reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>7</b>C</figref>, the treatment at three days after plants inoculation with the pathogen (3 dai) resulted in 55% reduction of geranium blight 170, a rate similar to the pretreatment at 1 dbi and 1wdi. However, in other five systems, SSG was not effective or at a very low level. This difference in different phytopathosystems seems associated with pathogen type. SSG potently suppressed spore germination (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b></figref>) but was less effective on mycelia, particularly those fast-growing filamentous fungi and <i>Phytophthora </i>(Table 5). In contrast, SSG can directly suppress the bacterial pathogen given that it shares features of bacteria that do not differentiate in cell growth and enter plant tissue through natural openings or wounds. Therefore, SSG may be used as not only a protective but also a curative biocontrol agent for diseases caused by bacterial pathogens it suppresses.</p>
<p id="p-0329" num="0315">There was great variation in results for treatments in <i>impatiens</i>-TWSV and two root disease systems. In <i>impatiens</i>-TWSV, treatment at 2 wbi other than two other treatments at short lead times resulted in 53% control of TWSV (Table 6). Furthermore, treatment at 4 wbi brought a negative result and significant variations among the replicates. With reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>7</b>D</figref>, SSG-treated plants displayed healthy flowers 180, while nutrient broth-treated plants displayed smaller, wilted flowers 190. In Fraser fir-<i>P. cinnamomi</i>, SSG treatment at 1 dbi resulted in a significant reduction of plants root rot by 46% compared to the control, although experimental differences of treatments were also significant. In addition, treatments at other lead times and 3 dai showed results that were either not significantly different from the control or presented significant differences among replicates. In <i>petunia&#x2014;P. nicotianae</i>, there was as high as 75% reduction for treatment at 2 wbi but negative results for other treatments, although the results had no significant differences with the control because of experimental variations. The cause of these variations is not clear. However, many factors could involve. SSG as root inoculant may not be as efficient as it used as foliage inoculant since it is a foliage endophyte despite its survival in pine bark dominant potting mix. Moreover, our knowledge of SSG ecology and its interaction with plants is yet limited.</p>
<p id="p-0330" num="0316">Factors such as overhead irrigation and rain full events after plant treatments that may affect minimal concentration for activities of SSG and methods used for pathogen inoculation, which may result in consistent plant infection are warranted to be further investigated.</p>
<p id="p-0331" num="0317">In summary, SSG is a promising biocontrol agent for a variety of plant diseases. SSG was effective not only for fungal and <i>Phytophthora </i>diseases but also bacterial, and viral diseases although control efficacy for some of the diseases was low. This spectrum of antagonism, including viral disease, has not been reported for any biocontrol agents documented. The broad antagonism spectrum of SSG may be attributed to its ability to biosynthesize antibiotics, lytic enzymes and insecticidal products, physical and chemical interference and competition with pathogens or ISR induction. However, further studies on its ecology, interaction with plants and its risk to human health is warranted for the application of SSG in the field.</p>
