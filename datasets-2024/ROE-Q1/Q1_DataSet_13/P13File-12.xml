<p id="p-0027" num="0026">The present disclosure provides various embodiments of cases for lifting portable electronic devices (PEDs) from a compartment of the case. Such a case may comprise a compartment with a rear wall and a front wall coupled to the rear wall with a space disposed between the walls. A lift member may be at least partially disposed within the compartment with an end of the lift member coupled to the front wall. The lift member may comprise a handle and a cradle portion. The cradle portion may support the PED within the compartment and upwardly lift the PED relative to the compartment when the handle is upwardly displaced by a user. Accordingly, a larger portion of the PED is exposed outside of the compartment allowing for easy removal of the PED from the compartment.</p>
<p id="p-0028" num="0027">A &#x201c;portable electronic device&#x201d; (PED) as used throughout the disclosure may include any of a wide variety of electronic devices. Specifically contemplated and illustrated are tablet-style electronic devices, including, but not limited to, electronic readers, tablet computers, tablet PCs, mini tablets, phablets, cellular phones (including smart phones), interactive displays, video displays, touch screens, touch computers, etc.).</p>
<p id="p-0029" num="0028"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref> illustrates an embodiment of a case for carrying a PED. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>2</b>A-<b>5</b>B</figref> illustrate an embodiment of a PED compartment having an embodiment of a lift member. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>6</b>A-<b>9</b>B</figref> illustrate another embodiment of the PED compartment having another embodiment of the lift member. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>10</b>-<b>11</b>D</figref> illustrate another embodiment of the PED compartment having another embodiment of the lift member. In certain views, each device may be coupled to, or shown with, additional components not included in every view. Further, in some views only selected components are illustrated, to provide detail into the relationship of the components. Some components may be shown in multiple views, but not discussed in connection with every view. Disclosure provided in connection with any figure is relevant and applicable to disclosure provided in connection with any other figure or embodiment.</p>
<p id="p-0030" num="0029"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref> illustrates a PED carrying case <b>100</b>. As illustrated, the PED carrying case <b>100</b> comprises an outer shell <b>110</b> that defines one or more internal compartments <b>111</b>. For example, the outer shell <b>110</b> may define a PED compartment. The PED carrying case <b>100</b> can also include a closing member <b>112</b> (e.g., zipper) configured to allow a user to selectively open and close the PED carrying case <b>100</b> to provide access to items within the internal compartments <b>111</b> and to protect the items within the internal compartments <b>111</b>. The PED carrying case <b>100</b> may also include a carrying member <b>113</b> configured to allow a user to carry the PED carrying case <b>100</b> in a hand or on a shoulder. For example, in one embodiment, the carrying member <b>113</b> may be a handle to be grasped by a hand of the user. In another embodiment, the carrying member <b>113</b> can be straps configured to be disposed over a shoulder of the user to carry the PED carrying case <b>100</b> on a back of the user.</p>
